Technology changes so fast these days that we spend much of our time just keeping up. Prediction, difficult enough at any time, is made even more complex when big data and predictive analytics immensely increase the number of options we need to consider. Is this because when we make decisions about the future, we tend to do so with one eye on the rearview mirror? To what extent is all prediction constrained by the contemporary paradigm in which we find ourselves and our businesses? Is there any way to break free from these constraints? Is there a pattern to the process of change that could be used to second-guess events ahead of time?

James Burke asks whether we can use big data and predictive analytics at the social level to take the guesswork out of prediction and make the future what we all want it to be. If so, this would give us the tools to handle what looks like being the greatest change to the way we live since we left the caves. A change that, some say, is due to happen within the next 50 years. A change that will alter everything.

take for instance one small modern

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,189
problem the matter of climate change

00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,349
governments have tended to approach the

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,540
question as we would from inside our

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,780
paradigm where we see the future as

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:18,000
preferably the same as before but faster

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,070
better and cheaper so the climate

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,340
solutions we are coming up with are a

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,789
old fashioned and be draconian to say

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,849
the least

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,279
reduction of fossil fuel use cut back on

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,009
transportation higher energy taxation

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,020
fewer flights all stuff that will

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,809
seriously reduce our commercial and

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,879
consumers activity and put paid to any

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,030
hopes the third world has of becoming

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,980
like us but the possibility exists that

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,539
there might be another way to deal with

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,730
climate change and indeed the other

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,320
global problems we face like the

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,410
worldwide shortage of drinking water

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,829
pollution starvation and resource

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,300
depletion back in the 80s there was an

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,030
outlier that could have pointed the way

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:06,930
but we did not have big data to identify

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:10,950
it and if I can find it it is a new IBM

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,900
gizmo back in the 80s called the

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,259
scanning tunneling microscope let them

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,570
do that line up 35 xenon atoms to read

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,490
IDM now the general public even today

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:23,070
may still not have heard of this outlier

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,320
but what it did was trigger a whole new

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,200
specialism we now know as nanotechnology

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,579
I know you know that a nanometer is a

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,400
billionth of a meter the width of what

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,280
three atoms today there are more than

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
15,000 labs all over the world working

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,890
on nanotech over 2000 nanotech products

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,930
are already on the market nanoparticles

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,460
are now used in cosmetics bandages

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,470
self-cleaning Windows batteries

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,670
lightbulbs sports equipment and

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,500
wrinkle-free clothing there are also

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,930
important nano processes already working

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,329
in the labs tiny delivery systems

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,119
capable of carrying drug molecules to an

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,130
individual target cell one end of a

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,920
straw you can stick in filthy water and

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,229
drink pure water at the other end spray

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,410
on transparent perovskite solar cells

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,180
that turn anything you spray into its

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,610
own solar power source

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,959
materials like graphene a hundred times

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,470
stronger than steel and less as a

00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,110
feather

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,390
sensors you spray onto a field so they

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,940
can alert you only when the crop needs

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,319
water or pesticides molecular filters

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,000
they can take all the pollutant

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,340
molecules out of exhausts and

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,100
smokestacks systems for trapping and

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,290
rendering harmless all greenhouse gases

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,850
now if these and many more similar

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,800
techniques are going to be on the market

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,959
in the next twenty years there may be no

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,940
need for the old technology economy

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,489
busting cleanup measures we are now

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,620
planning there's little doubt that

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,110
nanotechnology could eventually allow us

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,150
to consumer eyes all eight billion

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,610
people on earth and not destroy the

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,580
environment in doing so except for

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:59,459
something else nanotechnology promises

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,410
to do which could mean as I began by

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,450
saying that the future is no longer what

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,050
it used to be that is to say the same

00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,580
only better I said that back in 1981 IBM

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,280
invented the scanning tunneling

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,680
microscope and enabled us to move atoms

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,260
around thing is if you can pick up an

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,310
atom and put it with other atoms you

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,920
will encourage the atoms to

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,900
self-organize and clump together into a

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,610
molecule for instance you put two atoms

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,480
of hydrogen together with one atom of

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:34,739
oxygen you get h2o a molecule of water

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:38,940
here's one you might enjoy no you might

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,440
not yeah there is it put these atoms

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,430
together like that and you could make a

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,780
cuppa because that is sweet tea and this

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,430
is where the future stops being what it

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,350
used to be because that ability to move

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,140
atoms and molecules will change

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,030
absolutely everything everywhere for

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,500
everybody the device that would

00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,720
manipulate atoms and molecules is

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,530
referred to by researchers now as a nano

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,570
Factory

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,420
sitting on your desk or in your back

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,880
garden shed and the Nano factory will

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,220
make anything to give a sense of the

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,380
scale involved in building and operating

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,720
a nano factory there are 50 trillion

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,579
atoms in a grain of salt so putting

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,609
together a nano factory would require us

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,070
to be able to build trillions of atomic

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,349
scale robots to work on atomic scale

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,820
production lines taking atoms and

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,139
putting them together to make molecules

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,539
and then doing the same

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,430
to put the molecules together to make

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,680
materials and then shaping the materials

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,569
into stuff like food clothing

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,389
construction materials electronics a

00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:39,419
gold bar or a perfect Mona Lisa copy and

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,430
all fabricated almost instantaneously

00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,050
since down at the nano level things

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,780
happen a million times faster than up in

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,969
this human level the feedstock for the

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,909
Nano factory would be principally dirt

00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:53,699
air and water and the energy of course

00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:54,780
would be spray on solar now this may all

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,719
be sounding a bit like science fiction

00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,969
so let me add if the first atomic scale

00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:02,250
Nano factory production line robot was

00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:02,819
produced at manchester university five

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,189
months ago

00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:07,189
