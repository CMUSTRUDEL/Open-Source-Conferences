hi my name is Paco Nathan and I'm with

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,589
O'Reilly Media we're here at strata data

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,269
conference in London and it's pleasure

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:11,940
to be joined today by this man Khan

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,540
principal program manager at Oracle it's

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,420
been very good talk to you wonderful can

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,279
you give us an overview of Oracle cloud

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
infrastructure and and how this is

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,990
evolving so orchid cloud is really the

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,630
second generation cloud that we've

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,369
developed at Oracle I was part of the

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,279
first generation over at another cloud

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,829
vendor and you know a few years ago we

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,690
had another cloud offering and it worked

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,820
really well but then you know we thought

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,230
how do we step back and treat a

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,300
differentiated cloud offering rate that

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,800
kind of works for enterprises and big

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,500
Gator workflows and really a performance

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,020
Henry workflows right so you know kind

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,910
of step back and thought of what are the

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,590
optimizations we need to make and so we

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,149
you know built up a new cloud from the

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,370
scratch and from the ground up which is

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,859
blazing fast compute has really fast

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,210
Network storage and then the cloud

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,280
services that you typically want with

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,960
the public cloud so essentially as we

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,420
were building the cloud we had three

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,610
core pillars in mind and those were one

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,260
obviously unsurprisingly it has to be a

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,880
really good place to run Oracle the

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,560
workflows right so did you it really

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,970
must run Oracle databases and

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,650
applications better than anywhere else

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,600
so that's part one and kind of

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,770
optimizing all of the infrastructure to

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,710
do that really really well and

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,030
interestingly you know Reata so a lot of

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,409
those optimization is what you want to

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,299
do with big data and form summary

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,729
workloads in general the second thing we

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,829
wanted was how do we create a cloud that

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,540
is more performant than what you can

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,490
typically get on a cloud so essentially

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,560
having the barometric compute and bare

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,439
metal kind of performance that customers

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,509
are used to on-premise right and how do

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,509
you do that at a great you know price

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,950
range because we were you know coming to

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,600
the market at a later stage because

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,369
we've done this before you know another

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,439
places the team has got experience there

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,659
we were able to kind of step back and

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,520
innovate there and say hey we'll designs

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,040
from the ground up and because of that

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,420
we've been able to you know deliver

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,610
really good performance at really cheap

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,890
prices so typically we are 30% cheaper

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,200
on compute 86 percent cheaper on network

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,300
50% cheaper on storage so it becomes a

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,970
very compelling offering for customers

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,850
oh and third I mean the really key part

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,530
of

00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,710
we heard strata is how do we build that

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,420
open ecosystem right it's such a vibrant

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,790
ecosystem for big data is peas here and

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,160
so talking to the ISPs and how do we

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:27,700
create a cloud that's really a great

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,020
place for is based on on on OCI so

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,940
that's kind of the three pillars that we

00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,960
had for building or a good cloud Oh

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,240
fantastic

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,800
how about the big data side I mean how

00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,420
what is the approach then to to

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,600
integrating that part it seems like that

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,100
would be complex to go from the the

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,110
applications to running an Oracle and

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,450
blending in the frames but also also

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,950
valuable so it's actually sir you know

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,630
it's actually very similar if you look

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,640
at Oracle has been doing for 40 years

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,580
right we have 40 years of experience in

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,140
the data management analytics and the

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,910
optimizations we've done for those

00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,680
workloads are hey B you want a really

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,660
fast Network so you can move data around

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,840
you want really fast compute do you

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,430
really want to optimize for the database

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,200
but then if you think about it Big Data

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,300
workloads are almost exactly the same

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,950
you want to have really fast compute

00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,060
that you can process the data with you

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,470
want to move things around quickly

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,050
between nodes you can transfer data

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,850
stream data and it's really you know

00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,930
really cool if you can just move the Big

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,760
Data cluster or next to your Oracle

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,630
database or other data flows right and

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,580
stream data back and forth so those have

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,440
translated really well to us so we've

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,280
been able to get really strong

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,740
performance out of the same

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,470
optimizations l2 l3 layer optimization

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,210
at the network and then be able to you

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,460
know transfer that into performance

00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,710
gains for customers the second thing has

00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,180
been because of the open ecosystem again

00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,220
we've been able to go out and partner

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,380
with companies like cloud era I sure a I

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,390
and say we will make this a really

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,760
strong place for you guys to run and

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,010
shine and so it's not really you know

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,630
it's essentially the same as a customer

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,400
running these on-premise they're able to

00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,930
run the same applications on-premise and

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,120
on the cloud so it becomes a much more

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,910
natural transition from on-premise as

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,990
well what what kind of strategy is

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:13,660
Oracle taking then with respect to this

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:15,870
a I echo system and use of big data how

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,920
are you how are you leveraging the

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,210
trends that you're seeing as I guess

00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,650
another another way that I would

00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,690
describe

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,139
that mic imagine we're learning a lot

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,340
here at strata data any kind of feedback

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,930
that you're getting from customers

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,860
that's feeding in the strategy so again

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,090
one of the core reasons for coming to

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,220
Charlotte has to learn and listen right

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,259
to talk to a lot of customers there's a

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,789
lot of you know really innovative

00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,840
companies here so essentially talking to

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:41,759
them and understanding what they're

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,889
doing in terms of the trends we're

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,960
seeing from customers we're really

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:49,020
seeing two things that are kind of new

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,699
which is one that Hybrid really is the

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,470
new normal and so essentially I'm a

00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,470
cloud person I've you know design cloud

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,850
services for a number of years but what

00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,380
we realizing is that enterprise

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,260
customers especially the kind that we

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,150
work with they can't move everything to

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,740
the cloud right for there's data

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,979
governance reasons for several reasons

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,840
you need to have data living in within a

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,099
country's boundaries or on-premise right

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,440
for example if you have a line of

00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:15,300
business application that is on-premise

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,849
you want the data source right next to

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,479
it so all of our customers want to run

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:23,639
data sources and data processing

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,010
essentially on Prem and in the cloud so

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,840
we've focused a lot on creating hybrid

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,000
solutions so if you want to run on Prem

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,949
will connect you back to a big data

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,389
cluster or of the private network if you

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,880
want to run in multiple clouds we have

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,490
cross connectivity with all of the major

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,669
cloud vendors so really giving customers

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,260
options is our is a key focus area right

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:46,710
how do we give customers the option to

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,409
run wherever they want so the second

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,150
thing of that is that you know bits of

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,370
energy being such a big concern with

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,680
Doran's being a big concern how do we

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,960
let customers choose where they put the

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,760
data right so we've been partnering with

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,949
Clara for example for a number of years

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,050
on a big data appliance and so that lets

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,090
customers put that appliance directly in

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,720
the data center so you know following

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:10,320
that strategy

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,120
giving customers options on price and

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,800
giving them options on with but the data

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,440
we're you know how they want to process

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,380
that data has really been has been a

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,110
hallmark as part of that we essentially

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,760
have is what we call we want to bring

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,470
the algorithm to the data rather than

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,700
the data to the algorithm interesting so

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,160
if you're running data in

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,470
you know in a Oracle database we have a

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,790
machine learning system called oml that

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,650
runs directly on the structured data

00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,780
there so you don't have to move the data

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,150
into a big data cluster at all if you

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,130
want to run on a big data appliance you

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,770
can do that you can absolutely you know

00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,140
run a IML programs both from vendors and

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,400
from oracle directly under blinds and of

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,800
course if you want to move to the cloud

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,020
you have so many options there right

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,580
you can run our own data science cloud

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,800
which is essentially an acquisition we

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,930
did last year makes it really fast and

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,420
easy to create open collaborative

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,940
projects or you can run partners like

00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,590
issuer of AI and they give you a really

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,120
cool performance really cool set of

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,980
features as well so very rich set of

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,510
options exactly right so it's in it's

00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,480
all about giving the options to the

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:16,090
customer so rather than saying that we

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,860
know best or one fit size fits all it's

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:21,010
really about saying here's a very

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,630
innovative ecosystem let's work with the

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,320
ecosystem showcase that and make it

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,090
really shine

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,060
now you mentioned about moving the

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,810
compute to the data and the gravity the

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,210
data and and just to to contextualize

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,970
that I think that if you were to pull

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,680
the cluster traces off a very large tech

00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,380
giants and the clusters they're running

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,780
you'd see that so much of the resources

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,620
are just spent moving the data to the

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:49,630
compute absolutely and it it's it takes

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,720
a lot of time and a lot of cost to move

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,220
it right right so especially it's really

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,720
easy to move data into the cloud and

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,620
it's really difficult to move data out

00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,990
of the clock right it gets very

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:01,570
expensive to do that so a lot of our

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,580
strategy has been around how do we make

00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,500
that easier for customers a big you know

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,060
a big enterprise customer has been doing

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,950
big data for 20 years now right they're

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,900
used to doing this on premise they have

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,460
a large cluster footprint that they're

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,590
using right now so rather than saying

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:16,660
give all of that up just move to the

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,610
cloud we're saying hey run the things

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,740
that you want your you know more secure

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,110
data are your regulated data on Prem and

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,550
then connect that to the cloud when you

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,620
need to burst when you have an elastic

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,600
workload it need to read and write no

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,460
bring up a thousand node or four

00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,840
thousand or ten thousand or cluster and

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,910
you can bring that up in 20 minutes or

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,650
on your radiator workload tear that down

00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,570
and you and maybe

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,099
for what you need so yeah that's been

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,229
kind of a hallmark of what we've been

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,760
doing that's a really very rational

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,589
first architecture and trade-offs there

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,900
right it's really the best of both

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,850
worlds again coming from a cloud first

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,650
background I I've been building cloud

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,570
native applications for a number of

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,130
years and again a lot of focus on open

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,339
source there a lot of focus on partners

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,110
there you know but when you talk to

00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,930
Oracle customers when you dr. larger

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,279
customers cloud is obviously a great

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,070
option right you have infinite data

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,380
leaks on OCI on really blast storage you

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:10,410
have very fast compute but all of that

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,270
is useful for bursty and you know

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,670
transit workloads right if you have

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,010
things that if you're a regulated bank

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,110
in Russia for example you can't move

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,339
data out into the public cloud so at

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,260
that point you might need to actually

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,970
run something on Britain so we want to

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,190
give those options back to the customer

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:29,490
and you know empower them to make the

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,710
right decisions good you mentioned about

00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,060
the the aspects of open could you drill

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,089
down into that a bit how does that

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:40,050
really up advance this initiative

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:43,170
absolutely so as you know as a late

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,209
player in the or in the cloud market we

00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,760
had to make some rate or decisions right

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,690
how do we differentiate ourselves

00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,580
obviously we want to make sure that like

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,410
I said Oracle it runs create an Oracle

00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,940
right a price and performance is really

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,190
really strong and again we're going to

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,410
be typically 30 to 40 percent cheaper

00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,940
for a cloud restaurant blooded our

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,420
cluster running on OCI or system

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,570
anywhere else

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,370
about 40% faster but then the key

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,160
differentiator for us is that we did not

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,800
want to go reinvent the ecosystem right

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,270
I see Clara I switch to a store at a I

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,459
see a lot of these partners out here

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,830
doing very cool stuff so how do we

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,959
create how do we showcase the partners

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,089
on OCI how do we showcase them through

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,770
you know om applications how we show

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,180
best them through first party native

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,120
applications that we you know kind of

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,830
bring them onto the cloud itself and

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,890
then how do we create an ecosystem where

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,140
we are not trying to you know we use

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,050
things like terraform so terraform being

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,360
an open source format for infrastructure

00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,339
s-code so doing those things actually

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,500
makes it easier for customers to adopt

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:45,150
us which is good for us it makes it

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,709
easier for customers to run things both

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,240
in different places you can run the same

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:50,220
terraform scripts do

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,569
big data cluster in OCI you can move

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,670
that over to another cloud vendor it

00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:56,249
works you can move kubernetes over from

00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,829
OCI to your on-prem environment so again

00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:01,470
that open ecosystem makes it much easier

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,999
for us to be in customers and it makes

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,319
it much easier for customers to run

00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:06,209
their business at scale

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,249
I can imagine there's also other

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,199
benefits in terms of training using

00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,449
mapping tools they have literally

00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:14,730
broader audience of people who could be

00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,329
staffing for these projects a lot of the

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,429
CIOs

00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,860
I talked to they're one of their primary

00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:21,860
concern is how do I build back team

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,709
right how do I build a scientist team

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,809
you know in in places that you typically

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,279
would not be able to hire a lot of you

00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:30,540
know very skilled data scientists and if

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,300
you were to create something from

00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,610
scratch a new language or new ml

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,980
algorithm or you know a new data center

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,110
it becomes very difficult with using

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,199
open-source you have an existing set of

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,029
people who are very very familiar with

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,009
that who know how to do this already and

00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,800
you know it makes it easier to build up

00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:51,209
that team and again there's really good

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,499
partners already out there that writing

00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,730
that code so you can work with them

00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,069
directly to you know build your

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,509
applications no I'm curious about

00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:05,160
partners you mentioned about Clara h2o

00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:07,290
terraform I was a Magikarp what are some

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,420
of the other partners involved so again

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,100
because we want to make sure that

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,990
partners are front and center you know

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,009
we were right next to Clara in the booth

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,350
upstairs okay

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:18,089
if you look at the four demos we have

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,429
going obviously we have some Oracle

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,139
technologies we have you know serverless

00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:23,970
parked running we have autonomous

00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,100
databases running but right next to

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,589
those we have three demos running for

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,449
Clara we have a demo running for da Stax

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:31,920
and confluent right and these are some

00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,509
of our four partners

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,980
and Clara obviously is a national

00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,649
partner we've been working with them

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,779
since 2011 for the BDA big data

00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,549
appliance we're doing some really

00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:43,110
interesting work with them in terms of a

00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:44,999
new service coming out on ASEAN I called

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,709
the Victoria service and at the same

00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,720
time as collaborator goes to that

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,100
evolution of moving to a cloud era you

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,920
know a cloud force company through the

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,209
clock idea cloud we are working with

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,829
them to make sure that we are still the

00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:58,049
best place to run Korea right anywhere

00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:00,040
you know anywhere in the cloud so that's

00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:03,100
a very natural very long-lived partner

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,870
for us confluent and data stacks both

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,180
our leaders in their space they are very

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,649
you know complementary to our offerings

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,540
in the cloud as well so essentially we

00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,670
show cus them because if you want to

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,310
have launched streaming datasets moving

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,170
in for IOT for real-time trading for

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,970
manufacturing you know confrim does a

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,300
really good job there obviously we have

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,350
streaming services as well but again

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,899
customers again have the option of

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,509
picking one or the other so confident

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,519
data stacks so there are some of the you

00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:32,980
know ones that are more traditional and

00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,970
then stuff like a steward of the eye and

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,730
they're doing some really cool stuff

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,980
with you know driverless AI how do we

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,300
kind of bring that easier bring that to

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,220
the customers that they can start using

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,630
it and start adopting it so those are

00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,899
kind of the key partnerships we have an

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,790
evolving now it strikes me that the

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:52,269
first generation of cloud offerings were

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,490
very granular you had essentially a VM

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,680
that was not unlike the VMS you had in

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,600
the data center anyway okay and so the

00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,949
focus was there whereas it seemed like

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,740
the use cases were much more about

00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:04,990
leveraging frameworks in this generation

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,029
now are you able to offer more of a

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,120
high-level more of framework as a

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:11,949
service endpoint absolutely so again we

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,300
started with a bare metal offering so we

00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:15,670
were actually lower than the VM itself

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,639
is giving great very server even better

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,440
and again if you are able to if you just

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,389
want straight performance and you want

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:24,790
to just run as fast as possible that

00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,380
works great but now over the past two

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,360
years as we've evolved our services

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,069
we've been able to offer more high alert

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,440
services so we have a serverless SPARC

00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:34,180
offering coming out called data flow and

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,800
so you just submit the job you know you

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,480
don't have to spin up any compute and

00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,709
just processes the data and gives you

00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,990
the results that becomes very powerful

00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,069
really assigns cloud coming up so

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,660
essentially you get out of the business

00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:45,490
of managing infrastructure you just say

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,740
hey I want a project I want to be able

00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,480
to share that globally with my team so

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,449
you know making that a higher-level

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,380
construct we have data integration you

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:55,329
know a lot of offerings and data

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,310
integration so how do you build it a

00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,110
lake from three different clouds from

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,850
two different data centers all into OC

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,470
object storage right there's a lot of

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,300
ETL going on there there's a lot of

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,069
transforms and real-time streaming going

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,319
on there so you know we have offerings

00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:10,149
coming in there as well so it really is

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:11,750
again if you want to run your

00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:14,060
infrastructure you can do that so

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,010
we want to go high level and math and

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,150
sass you can do that as well so there

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,060
are patterns for that kind of

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:23,420
integration then absolutely so again if

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:25,640
you want to you know if you have really

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,050
performance heavy workload maybe you

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,730
just want to run directly on bare metal

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,520
yeah but bare metal the nice thing is

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,260
you would never have any overhead even

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,090
of Oracle code running on that box right

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,250
so there's when we give you fifty two

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:41,120
cores if you want terabytes of nbme RAM

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:42,950
you know nvme storage and 768 768 px of

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,380
RAM it's all yours so you can actually

00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,750
be very consistent with what you want to

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,640
do if you see that something takes 15

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,020
minutes at 2 a.m. it takes 15 minutes at

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,200
2 p.m. right so there's no closing

00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,390
Oracle yeah but at the same time if you

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,610
just want to have data science data

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,410
scientists quickly spin up a cluster run

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:01,310
immortal and tear that down that's

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,100
available as well

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,200
very good how about other trends that

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,730
you're hearing through the conference or

00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,320
just in general right about now so

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,660
that's been interesting right so big

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,150
part of strata is talking to people and

00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,350
kind of learning as well so Hadoop has

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,500
always been a traditional you know

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,120
really big workload that's definitely

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,860
the case but you know it seems to be

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,350
moving towards spark moved to a server

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,240
this part building data leaks has been a

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,580
really you know a thing that I've been

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,100
hearing a lot talking about how do you

00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,470
have this structured unstructured data

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,870
all collecting into one place all right

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,670
hopefully a very cheap cost making it

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,620
available for downstream services and

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,870
then how do you bring you know

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,870
predictive analysis using AI and ml into

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,850
it so what I'll be going and looking

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,130
back into is that really compelling

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,130
story around data lakes and then you

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,900
know streaming data in and out and IML

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,730
on top that's going to be it's a very

00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,990
basic construct like it's been around

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,760
for years but how do you really make

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,830
that shine for right enterprise they

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,230
were adopting that now right and and

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,510
this is the moment that we're seeing so

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,819
many mainstream businesses sort of

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,770
across the cancer absolutely FinTech

00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,170
insurance there's so much that's still

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,720
running on premise right now so how do

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,300
you make it easy for those guys you know

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,680
after those customers to have confidence

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,420
in the cloud to see something that

00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,640
they're very used to seeing on-premise

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,439
well so a similar structure a similar

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,680
govern governance structure similar

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,960
audit trails

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,580
if you are going to be audited by an by

00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,690
a federal government you want to make

00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,820
sure you have everything that you're

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,250
used to on premise as well so you know

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,260
helping those customers make that I said

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,140
cross the chasm into the cloud has been

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,340
a core part of my work fantastic thank

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,910
you very much it was really good to talk

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,910
to you great

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,240
