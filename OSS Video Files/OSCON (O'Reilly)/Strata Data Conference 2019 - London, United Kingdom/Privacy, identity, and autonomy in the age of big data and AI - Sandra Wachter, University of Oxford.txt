Big data analytics and AI draw nonintuitive and unverifiable inferences and predictions about the behaviors, preferences, and private lives of individuals. These inferences draw on highly diverse and feature-rich data of unpredictable value and create new opportunities for discriminatory, biased, and invasive decision making, often based on sensitive attributes of individuals’ private lives. European data protection law affords greater protection to processing of sensitive data, or “special categories,” describing characteristics such as health, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Big data and AI also aim to identify unintuitive small patterns and meaningful connections between individuals and their data. The analytics behind much automated decision making and profiling isn’t concerned with singling out or identifying a unique individual but rather with drawing inferences from large datasets, calculating probabilities, and learning about types or groups of people.

Sandra Wachter discusses how these technologies expand the scope of potential victims of discrimination and other potential harms (e.g., privacy, financial, reputational) to include ephemeral groups of individuals perceived to be similar by a third party. European antidiscrimination laws, which are based on historical lessons, will fail to apply to ad hoc groups that are not defined by a historically protected attribute (e.g., ethnicity, religion). Sandra concludes by arguing that a right to reasonable inferences could provide a remedy against new forms of discrimination and greater protection for group privacy interests.
