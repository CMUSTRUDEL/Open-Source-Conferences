Big data analytics and AI draw nonintuitive and unverifiable inferences and predictions about the behaviors, preferences, and private lives of individuals. These inferences draw on highly diverse and feature-rich data of unpredictable value and create new opportunities for discriminatory, biased, and invasive decision making, often based on sensitive attributes of individuals’ private lives. European data protection law affords greater protection to processing of sensitive data, or “special categories,” describing characteristics such as health, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Big data and AI also aim to identify unintuitive small patterns and meaningful connections between individuals and their data. The analytics behind much automated decision making and profiling isn’t concerned with singling out or identifying a unique individual but rather with drawing inferences from large datasets, calculating probabilities, and learning about types or groups of people.

Sandra Wachter discusses how these technologies expand the scope of potential victims of discrimination and other potential harms (e.g., privacy, financial, reputational) to include ephemeral groups of individuals perceived to be similar by a third party. European antidiscrimination laws, which are based on historical lessons, will fail to apply to ad hoc groups that are not defined by a historically protected attribute (e.g., ethnicity, religion). Sandra concludes by arguing that a right to reasonable inferences could provide a remedy against new forms of discrimination and greater protection for group privacy interests.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
and roughly my talk will be centered

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,120
around the paper that I recently wrote

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,309
which is called a right to reasonable

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,610
inferences rethinking data protection

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:15,389
and the age of big data and AI the basic

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,490
gist of that paper was to say that we

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,710
constantly engage in with digital

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,900
technologies they collecting our data

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,720
they are assessing outdated inferring

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,210
things about us constantly and then this

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,480
data is being shared with various actors

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,510
and this data those inferences steer our

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,309
path in life they for example an

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,190
inferences have an impact on whether we

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,350
get a job if we get hired fired if we

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,379
get insurance credit if you have to go

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,020
to prison if you allowed to university

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:48,750
so if algorithms and big data basically

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,180
making up our personality identity and

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,520
see our path in life I'm arguing we

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,500
should have a right to reasonable

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,920
inferences I write over Harvey being

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,629
seen well to defend that claim I

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,120
actually just take a step back and

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,189
compare this very important question to

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,610
the analog world that just think for a

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,640
second in a human human setting the

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,430
underlying question of that is who are

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,500
you if you asked me that question I

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,380
could give you various types of

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,009
information I could tell you for example

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,900
that I'm a lawyer

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,939
I could tell you that I'm Viennese and I

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,860
could tell you in my vegetarian all

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,170
those three things are true about me I

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,270
give you this information and what you

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,520
do if that information is out of my

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,020
control what you infer from it is

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,409
completely out of my control

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,920
so from the fact that you know that I'm

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,409
a lawyer

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,310
what you can infer for example is that I

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,500
like books and rules just true from the

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,090
fact that I'm being is you could for

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,710
example in firm they do like coffee and

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,259
from the fact that I'm a vegetarian you

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,869
could reasonably infer that I do like

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,310
animals there is an intuitive link

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,610
between the information that I give you

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,220
and what you can reasonably infer but

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,569
you can be wrong I could tell you yeah

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,489
well I'm Viennese but I don't live in

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,400
the UK for quite some time now I drink

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,170
tea now

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,599
I could give us information over and

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,420
over again we believe me or not it's

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,400
completely out of my control so the

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,200
question is how I spectating I different

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,120
why should I have a right over how I'm

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,599
being seen by an algorithm if I can

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,250
force human to seem in a certain way so

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,860
let's just look at a couple of examples

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,159
that recently made the news Netflix

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,620
Facebook Amazon Microsoft all those big

00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,750
tech companies were recently accused -

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,670
in for a very sensitive information

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,250
about their users without them actually

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,720
being aware of it they were accused to

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,400
infer ethnicity race gender sexual

00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,560
orientation health status all of that

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,590
even though their customers didn't know

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,359
about that and even worse than that this

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,609
information is then often being shared

00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:04,200
with third parties for example credit

00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:07,329
institutions credit institutions are now

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,370
sharing using social network data your

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,909
profile on Facebook your friends to

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,319
determine whether you should get credit

00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:16,959
similar here where insurance companies

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,940
use Facebook data and profiles and

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,329
friends on Facebook to infer if you

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,590
should get insurance and would rate so

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:25,510
in here that's just a big difference

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,549
it's not just information that I

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,099
volunteered to you it's also deep

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:32,260
information that I passively unavoidably

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,919
and unintentionally actually leave

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,889
behind

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,709
it's my clicking behavior my do location

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,389
my eye tracking all of that is being

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,859
collected you look at my friends on

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:46,799
Facebook and assess Who I am

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:49,629
and from that they're seemingly privacy

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,730
invasive and counter-intuitively are

00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,910
things are being inferred about me I do

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,489
have a intuitive link between being

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,859
Vinny's and drinking coffee but how does

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:03,519
my browsing behavior impact my credit

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,989
score I have no idea about that and even

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,540
worse than that this information is an

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,010
endless being replicated is not

00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,470
deletable and it's being shared with

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,299
third parties and that digital element

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,069
that new digital challenge is something

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,169
that the law recognized needs new

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,479
protection which is one of the reasons

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:21,370
why we do not have a right to be

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,630
forgotten in the digital world now even

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,120
though we don't have it in a human

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,780
setting so I'm arguing if you do have a

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,840
right

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,510
to be forgotten you should also have a

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,740
right how you being seen and therefore a

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,740
