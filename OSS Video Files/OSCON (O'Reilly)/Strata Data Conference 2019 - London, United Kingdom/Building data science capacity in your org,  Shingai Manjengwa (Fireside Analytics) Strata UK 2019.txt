Building data science capacity in your organization

The promise of using data to increase profits, decrease costs, and optimize everything else can only be realized if teams are empowered with the necessary skills to recognize data opportunities and participate in data initiatives.

Shingai Manjengwa shares insights from teaching data science to 300,000 online learners, second-career college graduates, and grade 12/6th form high school students, explaining how business leaders can increase data science skill sets across different levels and functions in an organization to create real and measurable value from data.
