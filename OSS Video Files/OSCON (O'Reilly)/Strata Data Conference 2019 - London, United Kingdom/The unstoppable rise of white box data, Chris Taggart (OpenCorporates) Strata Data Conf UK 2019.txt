Black box data—obfuscated proprietary data—has been the mainstay of many data markets for decades, despite its known problems: the lack of provenance, unclear legacy data models, and proprietary identifiers. Now, its time appears to be finally up, with even the US government rejecting it.

Chris Taggart explains the benefits of white box data and outlines the structural shifts that are moving the data world toward it.

and this was essentially how that data

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,770
was produced you got some original data

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,480
some some original source data which if

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,500
you had access to that you could see

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,139
where that came from

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,030
you could see how it was collected it

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,470
had local identifier maybe not great

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,240
ones but it had a local identifies and

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,850
there was a clear understanding a clear

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,980
model of what this of what this data

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,859
represented and then it was processed or

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,990
combined with another data set and and

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,240
what you got as a as a result from the

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,880
vendor was that the provenance had been

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,250
stripped off the model was no longer

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,480
quite clear what it represented and no

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,200
longer the way they put on proprietary

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,390
identifies except that's the simplified

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,309
version this is reality you've got data

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,649
that's coming in that's been combined

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,120
with the other data that data is then

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,800
bought you know is then sold to someone

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,180
else who combines with other data who

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,899
sells it someone else who combines with

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,379
our data in the field that I'm in in in

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,149
company information

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,010
you often hear the stories of people

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,329
buying back their own data they'd sold

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,620
it to someone who'd sold it to someone

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,760
who'd sold it someone else and then they

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,920
combine it with something else and

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,400
naturally they end up buying it back but

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,110
the world's no longer like that we've

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,430
come a long way since in its in that

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:22,020
since then we entirely live in a data

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,990
world today I think even before the rise

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,330
of mobile and all the changes of that

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,939
sport along you know it was about data

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,009
it was about datasets what they

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,420
represented power came from how you

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,189
could be combined together how they

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,710
could be interrogated what we could

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,360
understand about them and actually this

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,220
whole conference and this whole city you

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,950
know the whole starter series is just

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,009
exactly that recognition of the data

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,570
world we live in but now even for people

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,189
who aren't in the business their lives

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,909
are data what are their lives revolve

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,600
around data obviously mobile smart

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:03,299
devices you know the vice of maybe for

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,659
the DLT things like AI whether it's

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,970
driving whether it's our self-driving

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,660
cars or other things this is the world

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,660
we live in today

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,090
and in that world black box data just

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,430
doesn't work you know by having no

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,390
provenance it means you don't have the

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,280
context I mean I think you know most of

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,730
us in this room understand really the

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,620
power and the importance of metadata we

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,260
don't have metadata we don't have we

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,170
don't have provenance we just don't know

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,780
anything that we about that data we can

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,240
guess we can infer but actually that's

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,340
all we're doing when you have

00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,450
proprietary IDs you don't have the

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,940
ability to connect it with other

00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:50,110
datasets I mean what is a proprietary ID

00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:53,380
a five proprietary ID is more or less in

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,330
most cases just a foreign key into that

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,820
prefer to vent that learned there's a

00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,710
proprietary database and of course you

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,110
as a result of that when you're using

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,080
those proprietary IDs you get lock-in

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:06,310
you get a vendor lock-in data paint

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,670
model as I said it gives you limited

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,530
utility it might work just in this

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,190
limited use case but actually can you

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,430
use this data in other places and of

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,680
course the other defining feature of

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,020
black box data is is that it's it's it's

00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,310
closed down it provides there's very

00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,590
limited access to it

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,790
very few people look at this data and

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,500
they look at it generally in one

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,530
specific context and so you get very

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,450
poor feedback loops people aren't taking

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,850
this data on mass and combine it without

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,440
data people you don't have hundreds of

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,560
thousands of people looking at this data

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,739
all the time so that's why we need white

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,910
box data white box data it is for the

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,650
purpose in the modern world

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,310
it does have provenance and therefore

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,520
context it had users open IDs allows you

00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,470
to make connections across between

00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,780
different data sets and it doesn't have

00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,390
vendor lock-in there are transparent

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:04,030
models you can clearly clearly define

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,000
what what what data represents and that

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,070
gives it widespread utility and it's

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,850
public access which provides incredibly

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,850
good feedback loops

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,239
