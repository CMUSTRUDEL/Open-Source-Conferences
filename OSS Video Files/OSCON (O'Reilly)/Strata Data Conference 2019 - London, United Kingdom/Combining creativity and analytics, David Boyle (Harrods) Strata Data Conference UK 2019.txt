	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,160
I thought back over my career all the

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,440
business leaders I've worked with all

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,420
the people in different industries have

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,660
embraced analytics and creativity and I

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,639
tried to think if I could give one award

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,350
for a person that personified the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,190
combination of analytics and creativity

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,190
who would it be

00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:27,930
the answer is Snoop Dogg

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:32,070
so Snoop this is for you let me tell you

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,559
why I found myself at EMI Music about

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,469
eight years ago our job was to use data

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,660
to help the business yeah that's it

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,660
that's actually usually my brief

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,430
how can data help and of course there

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,300
are millions of ways that data can help

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,329
a business we picked one to start with

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,370
we decided that the best opportunity was

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,699
to use data to help drive the strategy

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,370
for an artist to help them navigate the

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,440
countries or audiences to drive growth

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,780
both for an artist and the marketing

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,930
teams as well step one

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,090
gather the data that you need for us

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,790
there was a million interviews over a

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,070
few years with customers it audiences

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,670
with music consumers around the world on

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,549
rich dimensions trying to distill

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:24,990
infinite complexity of people into ones

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,570
and zeros next it was crafting that into

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,520
something that would be insightful

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:33,810
clustering on the dimensions we felt

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,369
were most important useful actionable to

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,220
have simple clusters that we could use

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,350
and then predictive analytics step three

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,899
simple predictive analytics for each

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,270
artist in each country which type of

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,630
customer which segments would represent

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,880
the best opportunities for growth and

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,220
for Snoop Dogg there were a couple of

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,649
segments that really stood out and one

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,060
that he really latched onto we called

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,439
them gadget ears they were defined by

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,899
they were defined by their passion for

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,110
technology their passion for smart

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,910
phones and social media networks and all

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,979
the things technology early adopters it

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,780
was one of their values he really

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,360
latched on to them in the meeting he

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,950
kept saying

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,350
we got to get them gadget ears he's got

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,600
to get them gadget ears and sure enough

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,120
in the weeks and months and years that

00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,750
followed he went after them he was an

00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,350
early adopter of social media for good

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,110
or for bad

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,000
he was all across tech startups and

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,980
technology companies in partnerships and

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,590
collaborations and it worked

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,560
he built resonance in that audience and

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,220
as a result he's relevant to a whole new

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,220
