The last decade has seen incredible changes in our technology. The advent of big data and powerful new analytic techniques, including machine learning and AI, means that we understand the world in ways that were simply impossible before. The simultaneous explosion of public cloud services has fundamentally changed our expectations of technology: it should be fast, simple, and flexible to use.

Most enterprises now operate across multiple public clouds and in their own data centers and want the same flexibility and convenience they get in the public cloud, no matter where their data lives or their applications run. We’ve reached the point that the “enterprise data cloud” is a necessity. Mick Hollison describes the key capabilities that such a system requires and why hybrid and multi-cloud is the future for organizations that want to capitalize on the potential of machine learning and AI.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,140
we started out by asking our customers

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,210
and one of the great things that came

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,280
about by bringing the combination of

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,040
cloud era and Hortonworks together was

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,080
an incredible assembly of customers it

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,719
now numbers more than two thousand

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,940
customers on a global basis we're doing

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,400
business in 85 different countries

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,160
around the globe and perhaps most

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,830
importantly is where we're doing that

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,099
business it is almost solely the domain

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,109
of large enterprise customers and so you

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,969
can see there if you squint just a

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,320
little bit we're now an eighth of the

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,570
top ten banks

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,090
we're in ten of the top ten automotive

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,980
manufacturers in the world just to name

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,710
a few now you'd expect to see this kind

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,770
of a slide if Amazon was standing here

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,039
or Microsoft or Oracle or IBM but you

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,980
might be surprised to see this kind of

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,530
success and depth in large enterprises

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,719
represented by the new cloud era so

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,609
here's what those customers said to us

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,829
when we talked to them when we we talked

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,960
to literally hundreds of them and tried

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,090
to collect insights into what they'd

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,549
like to see us build next how do they

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,200
protect what they're doing in new ways

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,330
how do they have increased their

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,610
flexibility and what they asked for were

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,040
the following four things almost to a

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,810
company first they wanted to be able to

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,119
run their data workloads and their

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,220
analytic workloads in any cloud

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,290
environment they choose so that meant

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,680
all the major public cloud providers of

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,960
course Amazon Microsoft Google etc they

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,750
also wanted to be able to run in a

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,329
private cloud or straight-up on bare

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,090
metal in on-premises and they wanted to

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,250
be able to do all of this with multiple

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,409
analytic functions so they wanted to be

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,479
able to do streaming and ingest they

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,310
wanted to do data engineering they

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,049
wanted to do data warehousing and data

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,990
Mart's and they also wanted to do

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,110
machine learning in AI all on the same

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,180
data set and maybe you know falling into

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,100
the greatest of these is love kind of

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,009
category the greatest of the attributes

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,070
they asked for was for this to be secure

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,659
and governed so it's wonderful that it

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,940
does all these functions and it can do

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,489
them anywhere it doesn't matter if you

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,890
can't secure and govern them and then

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,870
lastly but not least and should be knows

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,180
surprise to anybody in this room they

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,100
wanted them to be open and that's not

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,069
just open source although we are

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,010
definitively delivering a 100% open

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,319
source data platform this is about open

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,050
api's and open exchanges and open

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,590
interfaces with partners all around the

00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,840
globe

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,870
so openness was paramount to everybody

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,660
that we spoke to and so we after taking

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,370
in all of this feedback we went about

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,160
trying to scribble the world's simplest

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,080
market texture diagram one that I have

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
challenged our salespeople to all be

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,600
able to draw on the back of a napkin and

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,910
it really looks quite straightforward as

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,280
you see here first you need to be able

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,860
to support multitude of different public

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,730
clouds around both separated compute and

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,870
storage same thing on the data center

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,760
next up you needed to provide that

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,160
common security and governance layer and

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,920
lastly up at the top of the stack there

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,930
the multiple analytic functions so again

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,510
what the architecture looks like

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,160
reflects exactly what our customers told

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,160
