The last decade has seen incredible changes in our technology. The advent of big data and powerful new analytic techniques, including machine learning and AI, means that we understand the world in ways that were simply impossible before. The simultaneous explosion of public cloud services has fundamentally changed our expectations of technology: it should be fast, simple, and flexible to use.

Most enterprises now operate across multiple public clouds and in their own data centers and want the same flexibility and convenience they get in the public cloud, no matter where their data lives or their applications run. We’ve reached the point that the “enterprise data cloud” is a necessity. Mick Hollison describes the key capabilities that such a system requires and why hybrid and multi-cloud is the future for organizations that want to capitalize on the potential of machine learning and AI.
