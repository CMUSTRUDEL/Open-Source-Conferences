	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,720
so we've talked a little bit about

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,920
targeting and a little bit about the

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,020
kind of concept of insights and

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,000
personalization data and Technology are

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,160
also driving apart from an overhaul of

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,990
what businesses like mine do for our

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,910
clients they're also driving an overhaul

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,130
in the way that we do so we have

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,439
creative acceleration this was a

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,080
headline from last year where alibaba's

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,730
AI engine can generate twenty thousand

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,730
lines of copy a second so if you're

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,949
creating either content that's gonna go

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,090
directly into an e-commerce platform or

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,980
potentially into a kind of an email

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,600
platform this kind of this kind of

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,950
machine can produce the words that were

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
just that would go with the images that

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,070
go out there and do it in a way that's

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,329
highly personalized around the person

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,440
that's browsing at that point in time

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,390
which is fantastic in many respects

00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,590
however at some point some of the humans

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,440
still needs to look at it to make sure

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,510
that it does actually make sense and

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,180
this is Adobe one of the Adobe products

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,370
so Adobe massive players in the creative

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,070
industry their technology and their

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,180
software is used to drive you know all

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,100
of this and and in essence these guys

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,080
are working on a product called sensei

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,610
which is or more than working on it's

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,520
there it's there

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,409
ai platform within their technology that

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,790
is used for multiple purposes all the

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,920
way from tracking data and making

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,689
recommendations about who to target in

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,310
an email campaign through to the

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,560
creative process and assisting the

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,240
creative process this particular example

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,250
they showed live on stage two years ago

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,500
I think and on this one they took a

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,320
napkin on which they had sketched an ad

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,450
for a movie poster for a movie about

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,939
animals in Australia and then they

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,310
essentially kind of scanned that sketch

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,020
and then started using voice commands to

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,820
get sensei to produce the content that

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,560
you see on screen and since they would

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,450
go through and it would pick out images

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,640
that match certain criteria like for

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,130
example we on a dramatic backdrop it

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,659
picked out the shape of these the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,979
animals that sketched on the paper and

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,450
not sketched well by the way and

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,579
identified them as the right animals a

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,920
kangaroo a koala and then pick the best

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,210
images that would fit into that space so

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,649
for business like mine which currently

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,390
uses people predominantly to do this

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,259
kind of work that's a pretty dramatic

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:12,000
change coming down the pipe and then we

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,330
have the the act of how we interact and

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,400
how our clients interact with

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,290
summers and this is just a quick example

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,270
of the kind of AI challenge that we have

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:25,420
to deal with it's a product that got got

00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:26,530
launched last week for Colleen sorry I

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,130
don't understand

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:37,270
Google assistant was designed for adults

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:39,730
so we took Google how to speak kid today

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:48,420
you can say to threats or mamba the

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:48,420
monkey okay here we go

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,590
that's or I should have said is that

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,880
this is this is a product which is

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,650
designed to encourage kids to brush

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,270
their teeth it's designed so that it

00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,620
will play the music that they can brush

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,120
too and gives them some instruction

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,450
about the right way to kind of go about

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,560
brushing and and of course we faced a

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,880
pretty significant problem that you

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,209
couldn't get kids to say exactly the

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,209
