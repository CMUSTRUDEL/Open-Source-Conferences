Despite the rise of data engineering and data science functions in today’s corporations, leaders report difficulty in extracting value from data. Many organizations aren’t aware that they have a blindspot with respect to their lack of data effectiveness, and hiring experts doesn’t seem to help. Join Cassie Kozyrkov to talk about how you can change that.

	00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,799
here's what's happening the platform

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,589
engineering community and the user

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,870
experience communities have finally

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,549
noticed us we exist and finally they are

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,949
creating beautiful things with the

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:22,640
philosophy that it should be easy to do

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:25,260
data science it should be without chores

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,119
without stuff that's hard just because

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,609
it's annoying and it takes a long time

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,380
the data science should go at the speed

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,239
of thought now this is incredible this

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,890
means that you get a lot of shiny tools

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,200
to play with it also means lowered

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,960
barriers to entry but you should also

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,190
think about what this means for the data

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,500
science careers

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,590
I mean imagine this future and this is a

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:50,370
plausible future if data science tools

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,289
get so easy to use so intuitive that

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,110
they're also really quick to learn and

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,870
pick up imagine your employers are not

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,960
actually gonna care which tools you know

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,799
coming into the job so if you strip away

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,310
all those chores what's left of data

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,159
science and the answer is a hang of a

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,400
lot you strip away those chores and you

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:20,340
get the course those human course of

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,860
what we're about here and you realize

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,229
that is not core in the singular its

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,049
course in the plural because there are

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,159
very many different types of activities

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,189
that go with completely different

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,560
mindsets within data science they're not

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:40,979
all the same thing and all of them as

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,840
mathematical as they are also have a lot

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,640
of the human component and you need to

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,869
see the human component if you miss the

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,790
human component you get them entirely

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,280
wrong in fact I don't even like that

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,880
term soft skills I prefer to call it

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,680
skills that are hard to automate data

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,680
science is full of these things and they

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,250
are all different from one another now

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,350
as these cores get exposed that as the

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,229
tools become easier you also get more

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,500
cores because people start using tools

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,660
in new creative ways that the makers

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,850
didn't even envision

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,040
and so now you get additional areas

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,470
within this expanding discipline so it

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,210
pulls the course further away from one

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,880
another this expanding universe and you

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,890
get more things joining it so you expect

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,320
this universe to expand even more

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,660
rapidly with this acceleration which is

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,400
really cool but it does mean that there

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,640
are lots of different people doing very

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,940
different things in there and so that

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,260
everything of data well no wonder you

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,410
have imposter syndrome

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,850
you're not going to cover all of it let

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,740
me show you even with today's classic

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,440
ones just how different the mindsets are

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,140
from one another so what can you do with

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,000
data if I had a excessively coarse

00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,410
breakdown cut put it kind of like this

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,650
you can look in your data to get

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,300
inspired by it you can leap beyond your

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,800
data with inference to make careful

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,530
data-driven decisions under uncertainty

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,990
and then you can also use your data to

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,280
fuel automation now the training

00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:13,560
programs today that most emphasize each

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,600
of these mindsets that serve in my

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,790
opinion as best preparation for these

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,990
very different activities kind of

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,300
shakeout like this

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,700
analytics teaches you the art of

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,350
exploration statistics is great for

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,150
inference and then the machine learning

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,100
and AI programs are really great for

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,350
automation I beg your indulgence for

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,130
using machine learning and AI

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,560
interchangeably in this talk

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,690
partly I do that because the rest of

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,370
industry does it so I give up and partly

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,290
because my new favorite definition of

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,100
the difference between them is on the

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,570
next slide if it is written in Python it

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,560
is probably machine learning and if it's

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,550
written in PowerPoint

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:56,070
it is probably AI yeah ah thank you now

00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,070
if you look at these three mindsets that

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,870
are involved in these different areas

00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,400
these are the three excellence is the

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,530
excellence of machine learning and AI is

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,030
an engineering excellence make it work

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,590
and not just make it work to clear a

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,959
metric make it work in production and

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,100
that scale reliably easy to monitor and

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,500
maintain that's an engineering

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,640
excellence of performance now once you

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,420
think you've built something that works

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,930
does it actually work should you launch

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,610
it

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,720
that is what inference is all about and

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,060
statistician

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,010
they are trained in the excellence of

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,780
rigor and going slowly and thinking

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,560
carefully not coming to silly

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,220
conclusions

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,060
the haba analytics analytics is about

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,520
the excellence of speed encounter what's

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,050
in your data as quickly as possible to

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,330
generate inspiration not to take it

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,700
seriously not to come to conclusions but

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,840
to find out what is there as quickly as

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,580
possible and we need to look at these

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,420
three mindsets you see that they're

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,420
