over the years I've invented many design

00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:08,530
tools for working backwards like pair

00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,719
design and user personas one of our

00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,480
oldest tools is an exercise called

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,400
pretend it's magic more than any other

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,710
it exemplifies the power of working

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,610
backwards to break new ground and to

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,200
frustrate conventional thinkers

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,720
pretending it's magic is easy you just

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,710
ask yourself how would we solve this

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,539
problem if anything were possible

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,730
typically conventional design and

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:36,220
engineering begins with the ritual

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,280
recitation of constraints and

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:43,450
requirements these tell you what you

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,100
can't do and what you must do but this

00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,290
approach condemns you to what you

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,780
already know in ways that you are

00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:54,160
already familiar with it is a roadblock

00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:57,219
to innovation it's assuming before

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,190
knowing it emphasizes history convention

00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:03,299
old technology old mental models and the

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,670
way we've always done things around here

00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:08,560
instead start by working backwards start

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,569
by throwing out everything all your

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,880
assumptions all those known limitations

00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,950
for the moment just assume that all

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,869
technical problems can be solved that

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,850
all organizational hurdles can be

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:23,499
overcome and that all resources are

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:26,799
available only imagine the possibilities

00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:33,130
where does the user want to end up what

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:34,810
would make the user happy when you work

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,909
for words you take what you have and you

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,979
improve it incrementally but when you

00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,020
work backwards you examine its

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:42,969
underlying purpose what it's trying to

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,819
accomplish its goals

00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:50,380
you ask why instead of what or how

00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,779
companies have their own goals and you

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,270
have to satisfy them but users have

00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,609
different and more important goals

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,039
people often imagine that the company's

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:04,659
purpose is equivalent to the users and

00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:06,369
that's one reason why companies fail so

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,530
when your boss tells you to deliver some

00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,149
feature some service to your user you

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,420
have to first find out what the user

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:14,260
really wants you have to seek out your

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,939
users

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,560
and listen to them you need to learn

00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:20,319
their motivations and get into their

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,329
heads to absorb their mental models you

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,120
question the nature of your product and

00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:27,250
reshape the experience you change the

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,459
fundamental value of the product which

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,590
in turn affects the strategy of the

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:37,720
business eventually you find yourself

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,629
asking even bigger questions beyond

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,930
business questions about our society our

00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,790
government and about social justice the

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,950
more you work backwards the more

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,310
connections you see in the world around

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,310
you the more inequality you detect and

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,909
the more opportunities you find to make

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,909
a better world

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,650
