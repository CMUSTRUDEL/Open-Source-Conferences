this is what things look like today this

00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:10,580
is going to be three really quick slides

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:13,099
here is a small sampling of some of the

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,679
independent consultancies witcha form

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,050
the core of what will become an

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,240
expanding perimeter not just around the

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,290
numbers but around the nature of design

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,330
work in the Bay Area so we've got the

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,730
the original consultancies I do frog

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,260
lunar and then a second generation that

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,200
is spun off of those and we're now

00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,090
seeing a third and a fork already I've

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,720
got maybe a dozen up there but they're

00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,980
probably two or three hundred by now

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,110
second these slides are going to get

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,150
really ugly so I apologize for that

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,420
again I'm a tourist there are real

00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,850
designers in this room second we have

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,790
product oriented companies with their

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,380
internal design groups and this is

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,360
practically every company in the bay

00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,000
area including some of the most

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,550
successful and important and influential

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,860
companies and other organizations in the

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:08,689
world so we could just go on and on and

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:14,270
on with this 180 UX designers at at uber

00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:17,899
another 40 or so at Pinterest the

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,639
numbers are growing exponentially and

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:21,319
then the third thing that seems to be

00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:24,079
happening I warned you the slides would

00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,240
get ugly the third thing that seems to

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,109
be happening lately in terms of this

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,039
expanding perimeter is the incorporation

00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:36,560
of design activities of some sort into a

00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:40,009
growing number of organizations that are

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,249
not particularly product oriented so

00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:47,090
what's going on when we have banks such

00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:51,679
as capital one merging or acquiring a

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:54,079
design consultancy lunar or excuse me

00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:57,939
that was McKinsey Capital One acquired

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,529
adaptive path I got all confused there

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:03,859
Silicon Valley Bank setting up a design

00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:06,829
thinking oriented SWAT squad several

00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:09,769
blocks from here kleiner perkins the

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:11,750
original venture capital firm putting

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,140
John Maeda in place a couple of years

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,470
ago as its first

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:21,270
nine fellow so in a way what seems to be

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:24,000
happening is design is coming too coming

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,920
into its own and becoming accepted not

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,100
as the sort of a decorative fringe

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,380
around the core activities of companies

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,220
and organizations but really central to

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,220
what they are doing

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,790
