design requires both considering the

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,450
world as it is and having a strong point

00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,270
of view on how it ought to be and then

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,340
making that plan to get there it's when

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,189
these moments are connected and they're

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,810
aligned and the value is building on

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:27,910
itself that the greatest magic occurs

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,060
beauty and real clear and beautiful and

00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,920
most luxurious design has a place in

00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,070
people's lives regardless of who they

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,310
are it's really about how do you think

00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:44,220
about what people want and how to think

00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:44,220
about the future as a designer

00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:52,320
it's a process not an event it's

00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,390
something that you build across a chain

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,539
of events to not only do consistently

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,210
but you consistently well-designed

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,189
talent is the fundamental constraints on

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,080
the tech industry pace of innovation and

00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,399
quality the output it's not engineering

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,320
it's not product marketing it's not

00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,030
product management it is designed we are

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,890
the thing that's holding back tech right

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,539
now and it is a moment in time where we

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,890
have an opportunity to really change the

00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:17,220
game and create a much more usable

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,140
useful and beautiful world Design

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,299
Thinking has been around out for more

00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,890
than a generation it's become

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:29,130
established as the way to build products

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,280
services and experiences with a focus on

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,240
the people who will use them rooted in

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,060
empathy collaboration prototyping and

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,509
iteration design thinking is the way

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,780
that startups agencies and academic

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,820
programs are infusing their work with

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:57,280
new ideas and new energy

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:59,340
