	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,970
the companies that you've worked for are

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:09,870
so radically different from a place like

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:14,249
Google Avon liz claiborne swatch calvin

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,189
klein Mattel gap Disney and you are also

00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:22,109
an entrepreneur and so Google seems like

00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:24,000
such a unlikely place not necessarily

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,019
for someone like you but for a company

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,619
like Google to have someone who's not a

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,510
computer scientist or text beat nerd and

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,430
so maybe even we can start by you

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,370
telling us a little bit about how you

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,140
navigated that career and how your

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,860
experiences have kind of sets you up for

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:48,870
this role at Google ok you know I see

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,600
the continuity behind all that because

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,560
I'm a builder a builder of ideas of

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,570
teams of product my dad was a car

00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,730
designer and as a kid he I think he

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,160
wanted a son and he got a daughter but

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,710
he still took me to car shows put me in

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,659
front of the hubcaps when I was five

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,090
years old I was I level with the hubcaps

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,100
and taught me what I now understand is

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,039
how to get into that flow state and see

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,049
things beyond what they appeared to be

00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:18,560
so I became a jeweler I think a

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,359
metalsmith because all those years of

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,579
really paying attention to how those

00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,880
hubcaps were designed put together

00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:29,009
connected and as he taught me what other

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,810
things in the world could be connected

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,450
in that way I became a jewelry designer

00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,929
but it was always around my curiosity of

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,880
how things work I was also a psychology

00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,170
minor in school so it was about how

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,560
things work for people and I just

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,630
followed my intuition of what felt right

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,850
when an opportunity would come up it was

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,280
like hmm I haven't designed that before

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,490
or I haven't put my mind to that

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,209
category but it's always been consumer

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,950
products and I've always been the one

00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,679
pushing the envelope in some of these

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,320
more traditional companies and now at

00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:12,600
Google it feels like home because I'm

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,800
with curious minds as well

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,470
that's the thread that ties you all

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,810
together mm-hmm that's interesting so

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,690
now your role at Google is you

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,090
responsible for hardware design yes now

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,030
that we know last year we launched the

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,830
pixel phone google home and Google is

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,680
really going to continue to build its

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,970
portfolio of hardware so I am

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,000
responsible for creating this design

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,040
language along with my team across all

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,600
and user experience across all of these

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,360
categories so it's an incredible

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,760
opportunity well how would you describe

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,960
Google's emerging hardware design

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,320
language I mean with physical devices

00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:58,740
it's the physicality kind of emanates a

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,120
sort of certain spirit or an energy you

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,220
know like when you're deciding to buy

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,600
something to put inside your home like

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,910
you're looking at that and that's in

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,360
your own personal space and also for

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,330
everyone to see so it's a very deeply

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,160
personal and very curated kind of

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,290
selection for the consumer in a way that

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,780
I think is much more deliberate than

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,180
like how we choose what software apps to

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,670
use on our phones so how do you think

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,340
through this well first of all today I

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:30,660
think product design is really the

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,130
entire experience and the software the

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,140
hardware they just have to dance with

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,520
each other and it's the emotional appeal

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,200
of both what are the smarts inside and

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,660
what is this going to do for my life as

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,610
well as how does it fit into my life so

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,730
a lot of what we're looking at now that

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,980
it's clear Electronics is here to stay

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:53,670
the question is how does it fit into our

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,040
life and our environment versus standing

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,170
out I think you know in the beginning it

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,450
was the columns of black plastic that

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,350
you would see all over and now I think

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:08,150
it requires a different lens as we

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,100
integrate it into our life interesting

00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,320
and are there certain psychological

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,260
traits or properties or ideals that are

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,790
being manifested in the design well I

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,980
think myself and my team I mean we're

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,440
interested in technology that amplifies

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,470
our humanity doesn't take it doesn't

00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,660
take us out of it so

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:35,790
there are you know principles of being

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:38,900
you know human and simple that we embody

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,900
