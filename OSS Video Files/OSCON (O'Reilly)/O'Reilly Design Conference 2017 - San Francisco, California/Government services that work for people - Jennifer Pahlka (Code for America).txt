and that's why i would say in these

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,130
interesting times as we're all talking

00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,140
about please remember that for many

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,710
people in our country the status quo is

00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,600
not worth protecting we have to invent

00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:19,150
something new something we haven't seen

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,160
before and build that that thing that

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:25,000
works that people don't want to blow up

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,039
and that particularly in the context of

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,199
government which is one of the things I

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,300
deeply care about making helping make

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,100
our society work better you've got to

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,989
remember that you can't just say it

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,809
should be done better by someone else

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:40,600
the decisions in state local federal

00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:42,760
government in social movements are made

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,190
by the people who show up and can do it

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,070
and I have seen this happen in so many

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,690
cases in government where decision

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,850
different decision was made that

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,270
benefited people just because someone

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:57,370
who had skills and cared came and took a

00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,610
job and started making it a little bit

00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,610
