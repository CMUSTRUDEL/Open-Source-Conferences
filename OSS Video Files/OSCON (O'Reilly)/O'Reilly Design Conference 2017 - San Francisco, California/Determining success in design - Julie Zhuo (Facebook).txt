what I do deeply believe is that

00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:10,070
understanding data leads to better

00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:12,019
design and if there's nothing else you

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:14,929
guys take away from this talk this is

00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:17,470
the most important point and the reason

00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,210
why I think this is so important is that

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,940
what we're trying to do as designers is

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,610
to make a change in the world when we go

00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:28,160
and we design a product at the end of it

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,930
we want something to be different we

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,850
want people to behave differently

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,680
we want them to you know think about

00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,440
something differently or we want them to

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,600
feel something differently and the way

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,190
that we know that we're successful means

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,340
that we have to have something concrete

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,170
that we can measure ourselves against we

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,230
need a way to help hold ourselves

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,350
accountable and this is why figuring out

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,270
how to measure success whether

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,760
quantitatively or qualitatively it's a

00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,030
huge part of what it takes to design and

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,680
ultimately achieve our goals

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,899
the key of course is that we need to

00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,999
actually start with the destination in

00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,679
mind and one of the things that's hard

00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:09,020
about data is it feels like there's so

00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:10,789
much of it you know at any given point

00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,909
there's there's tons of numbers there's

00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:15,439
tons of things we could be measuring but

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:17,929
the way to get started is to actually

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,630
think you know where do I want to go

00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:23,479
before we start on this road trip what

00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,759
does the destination look like and so I

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,159
challenge you guys all when you start a

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,950
new design project to ask yourself this

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,990
question in the best version of the

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,689
world if the thing that I am designing

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,270
is wildly successful you know beyond

00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,219
anything I could have dreamed of what is

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,069
different what is different about

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:46,549
people's behaviors feelings actions

00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:48,709
emotions and once we can describe that

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,380
and once we can get a very concrete

00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:53,899
picture of what that looks like then

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,789
let's figure out how to map that to

00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:59,349
something that is measurable and that we

00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,349
can hold ourselves accountable for

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,880
