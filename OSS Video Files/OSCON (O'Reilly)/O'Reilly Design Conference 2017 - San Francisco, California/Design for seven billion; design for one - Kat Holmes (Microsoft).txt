	00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,259
so for today I wanted to take you

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,919
through three principles have come to

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,799
know and use in practice with at this

00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,749
point upwards of 5,000 designers

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,430
engineers and product managers and

00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:20,580
thinking about how to bring inclusive

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,980
design to their products recognize

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,270
exclusion learned from diversity and

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,920
solve from one an extent to many first

00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:30,720
principle recognizing exclusion it

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,480
happens when we solve problems using our

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,850
own biases one of the most important

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,160
types of biases that we consistently use

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,660
is without knowing it is our own

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,200
abilities if we design something that we

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,220
ourselves can see touch hear sense it

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,530
ends up working well for people with

00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,739
similar abilities but can exclude a much

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,329
broader population of people one of my

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,610
favorite examples of this was the Air

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,670
Force the initial design of flight

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,630
deaths in fighter planes and the Air

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,809
Force and the first designs took samples

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,250
of dimensions of pilots in space between

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,229
their eyes the length of their arms

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,090
their height that was a hundred and

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,130
twenty different facets and then they

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,600
averaged that data out and went right in

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,120
the middle and said that must be the

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,310
perfect pilot and then they designed

00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,010
that flight deck in a fixed way to meet

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,260
match that perfect pilot well there are

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,750
a high number of accidents they couldn't

00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,090
attribute to mechanical failure or to

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,400
pilot error and they were quite frankly

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,159
running out of pilots and in preparation

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,549
for the Korean War they revisited those

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,960
criteria and took another sample four

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,570
thousand pilots this time to see who

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,390
actually fit all of those dimensions who

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,890
fit every facet and they you probably

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,400
guess what the outcome was is that no

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,729
one no one fit every dimension that they

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,259
had SPECT for that flight deck at the

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,850
same time they designed this experience

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,610
this flight deck to work for everyone

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,409
and no one it's relevant to what we do

00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,159
today every time we use a somewhat

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:01,890
homogenized

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,170
persona or thinking about large averages

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,819
of data and the way that we make design

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,929
decisions based on that type of criteria

00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,790
another example have been thinking about

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,610
a lot lately as gender exclusion and

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,620
what that looks like in products

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,890
the automotive industry for years used

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,730
an average male crash-test dummy in

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,530
their safety testing but women were 43

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,260
percent more likely to be injured in a

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,820
car accident and so we think about such

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,710
as the preference of the aesthetic of

00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,970
something it's built into the decisions

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:34,220
that we make and how we test our

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,320
products and who were to designing them

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,270
for that can lead to disproportionately

00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,770
benefiting one gender over another so

00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,390
exclusion can happen in lots of

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,680
different facets as a couple of examples

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,980
here that really fall in the physical

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,510
and social category but there's a lot of

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,070
work that we're doing to understand how

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,600
cognitive exclusion the way that we

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,650
think and process information also

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,850
impacts the products that we design

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,330
second principle learned from diversity

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,790
so the video I showed at the beginning

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,700
is a great example of the kinds of

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,380
conversations that we facilitate with

00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,030
people who have expertise and interact

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,770
in the world through particular

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:18,920
abilities Viktor for example who works

00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,330
out of UC Berkeley it's not only an

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
expert in inclusive design but he has

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,140
great expertise and navigating the world

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,600
as a wheelchair user or someone who is

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,610
blind who has navigated using computers

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,430
through voice and audio for a long time

00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:33,950
actually gives us a great insight into

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,260
how to design computing for any of us

00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,510
who are talking to our household devices

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,130
or phones and so it's that strengthen

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,470
that ingenuity and that expertise in

00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,970
navigating an environment is such an

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,420
important resource in thinking about

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,520
designing inclusively one of my favorite

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,250
examples I had a lot favorite a lot of

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,250
favorite examples today but pill tax was

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,380
first with I do they talked to 15

00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,480
lifelong cancer patients who used

00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,400
upwards of 16 different medications in a

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,290
week and the massive amount of

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,300
complexity and the risk of making a

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,130
mistake was incredibly high but what

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,170
pill packs did is they didn't come out

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,209
of this designing a better pill bottle

00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,459
or a better way than making the pill

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,320
bottle sleep bobble safer they

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,590
reimagined the entire system of delivery

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,950
and service of medication to customers

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:25,240
in a way that was easy for people to use

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:28,150
but also very very

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,250
hard for them to make a mistake third

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,620
and final principle solving for one

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,680
extending to many this is really about

00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,690
that curb cut and the flexible straw and

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,430
the email the start of the design from

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,530
one person but then went on to benefit a

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,000
much broader group of people started to

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,729
wonder can we do that in a repeatable

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,680
way so you know one kind of clear

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,720
example that we can all relate to is

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,039
subtitles and captioning you know

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,830
originally designed for people who are

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,259
deaf hard of hearing but they go on to

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,389
extend benefits anyone who is in a loud

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:06,130
environment and trying to follow a news

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:07,900
story on the TV or children and new

00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,789
language learners who are learning to

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,220
read it facilitates reading

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:13,419
comprehension and so as we think about

00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,310
the design of interaction with

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:18,159
technology the ways that people touch

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,380
see here and speak with computers you

00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:23,050
have a similar kind of continuum moving

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:26,560
from a permanent temporary or

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,870
situational disability it'll take a

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,370
closer to zoom in on one of these as an

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,320
example for someone who's born with one

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,960
arm you know designing an experience to

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,310
work well in a way that extends a

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,219
benefit also to someone who's injured

00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,800
their arm or is a new parent holding an

00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:44,469
infant the key to it isn't just focusing

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,169
on the limitation or ability it's about

00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:49,090
focusing on the human motivation what do

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,560
you want your design to be great at what

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:52,870
is the experience that you want people

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,520
to participate in is it a sense of

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,530
Independence or connection with other

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,229
people or the ability to create and

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,060
contribute to a project and designing

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,620
something that works well on that

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,630
permanent end of the spectrum but also

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,190
achieves that goal is something that

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,580
then can extend benefit to much more

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,580
people

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:16,909
