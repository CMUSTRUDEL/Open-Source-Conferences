Thank you Thank You Leah wow what a

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,469
great morning already it's just really

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,480
inspiring ideas and I'm thrilled to be a

00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:16,600
part of it this morning as Leah said I

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,130
was here just over a year ago and at

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,609
that time I had the pleasure of

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,470
announcing the public launch of IBM

00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:26,560
design thinking our framework for

00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:29,439
creating awesome user experiences at the

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,130
speed and scale of the global enterprise

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,340
it's been a big year for for design at

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,740
IBM since then we've continued to grow

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,920
our program and and to build a culture

00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:45,430
of Design at IBM I'm thrilled to be back

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,300
to tell you more about it I I want to

00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:56,890
frame my presentation this morning

00:00:49,300 --> 00:01:01,540
around one central question so what yeah

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:03,850
so what so what that IBM has hired a

00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,939
thousand designers and the last four

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,820
years so what that we've built 36 design

00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:11,740
studios in 20 countries around the world

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,859
who cares that IBM has published a

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:18,310
portfolio of design practices anchored

00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,799
by IBM design thinking frankly none of

00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,759
this stuff matters unless we can put it

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:28,929
all together to make great experiences

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:33,039
at scale none of this matters unless we

00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:36,310
can combine people plus places plus

00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:39,399
practices to equal great outcomes great

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:43,389
outcomes for IBM our clients and our

00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,179
users today I want to tell you a story a

00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:48,159
story that I hope will illustrate for

00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,590
you how we're doing the hard work of

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,810
design in one of the largest most

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,539
established most enduring companies on

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,149
the planet and I want to link this story

00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:00,939
and the renewed mission of design at IBM

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:03,689
to the resurgence of our company as the

00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:06,279
global leader and enterprise technology

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,310
the story I want to tell comes from the

00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:11,980
IBM power systems business and a project

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:14,210
we call project monocle now Power

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,130
Systems is the IBM server

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,770
business this is like dense dense

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:23,900
technical stuff it's one of our core

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:26,680
legacy businesses but as with as with

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,540
any piece of technology there's always a

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,040
person at the center of it and that

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,160
person that we're most concerned with

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,590
here is an IT administrator who is

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,470
managing a huge server facility will

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,170
call him Jack the lead systems admin

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,350
another key person in the mix is Jack's

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,100
boss Jill the IT manager who oversees a

00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,630
bunch of these server facilities one of

00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,330
the things that Jack has to do on a

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:57,500
regular basis is to update the firmware

00:02:53,330 --> 00:03:00,740
on his system I know firmware updates

00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,620
and server farms it doesn't get any

00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,630
sexier than that right well this is

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,030
where it gets interesting when our

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:11,840
design team first received a brief for

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:15,620
this project it basically said we need a

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,400
single click update whatever you do

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,680
deliver a single click update well our

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,990
design team did what any great design

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,750
team does first of all they questioned

00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:29,210
this premise and then they went out to

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,250
find their users the monocle design team

00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,800
conducted more than 30 user interviews

00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,830
with the jacks and Jill's of the world

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,260
and this is what they heard from Jack

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,320
the most difficult thing for me is to

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,660
get information he said to see all the

00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,360
pieces and how they belong together so I

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,620
can properly plan what should I do next

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,210
is this the right patch are we exposed

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,350
trying to schedule upgrades is like

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:59,300
pulling teeth is what jack told us

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,900
interesting Jack didn't say anything

00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,640
about a single click update what he did

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,250
say was hey this is really complicated

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,680
stuff and I wish I felt more confident

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,070
when I was planning my updates let's

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,720
hear what Jill the IT manager had to say

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,790
she said managing a diverse environment

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,739
can be really really difficult getting

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,000
all the right people to agree can take

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:25,910
forever again nothing about single click

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,350
instead our team had revealed a series

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,660
of pain points

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,910
real pain points from real people the

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,010
system is overly complicated it takes

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,500
too much time I don't have enough

00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,510
visibility I'm uncertain about the steps

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,490
I should take and it's really hard for

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:44,630
me to share information with my

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,000
teammates inspired by these insights

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,520
from real people the monocle design team

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,070
was able to change the direction of this

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,040
project working closely with these users

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:58,040
they prototypes a completely new monocle

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,840
experience and what was the outcome of

00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,780
this close contact with their users

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,720
throughout the design process as you can

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,880
see here an elegant interface a

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,920
streamlined workflow that gives Jack the

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,830
control to plan his updates in an

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,660
orderly methodical way saving him time

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,350
giving him the clarity and confidence

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:21,350
he's been longing for oh and when he's

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:23,810
done developing his update plan he can

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:29,720
easily share it with Jill who can review

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:31,400
it anywhere at any time it's always

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,160
great to see a design team having this

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,700
type of influence on a big technical

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,190
problem but most importantly here our

00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,590
users and clients are clamoring for

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,530
monocle as you can see from this quote

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,180
from one of our clients the product went

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,790
into beta at the end of last year and we

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,970
can't see can't wait to see how it will

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,440
change this important IBM business

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,440
here's a picture of the monocle design

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,520
team they're based in our Austin Texas

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,210
design studio they really did some

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,010
heroic work on this project but you know

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,350
who the real store a hero of this story

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:11,540
is it's this guy his name is karl karl

00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,640
burnett and he's a distinguished

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,650
engineer at IBM one of the senior

00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,720
technical architects in the power

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,930
systems business the guy is brilliant

00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,800
and he was one of the advocates for the

00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,180
original single click update direction

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,400
initially karl was kind of skeptical of

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,680
design thinking you can see him here in

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,460
this initial design taking workshop kind

00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,080
of hanging back in the back right but

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,810
here's what Karl had to say at the end

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,660
of the final playback for project

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,670
monocle monocle

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,250
said engaging our stakeholders at the

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,800
beginning instead of the end allowed us

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,050
to get at the true pain points he went

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,120
on to say you could feel the emotion

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,330
from these users coming off the comments

00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,340
and quotes it was really powerful my

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:01,930
gosh Carl you're talking like a designer

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:05,350
here so remember my original question so

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,840
what when I asked why people places and

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,490
practices are so important they're

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,910
important because they set the

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:15,040
conditions for non-designers

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,950
non-designers at IBM people like Carl to

00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,020
see the value of a human centered

00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:23,160
inclusive and collaborative approach to

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,600
solving tough technical challenges as

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,590
important as the user experience our

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,810
team created on monocle is this new way

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,330
of working is the real story of the

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,250
transformation of IBM and we're seeing

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,140
multidisciplinary teams across our

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,480
company experienced the same

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,700
transformation they're finding users

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,400
they're understanding them as people and

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,050
they are making their making truly

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,140
relevant user experiences that are

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,930
transforming IBM businesses and this

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:56,320
design driven approach is impacting all

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,330
of our strategic imperatives and it's

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:04,080
driving great outcomes in every industry

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:07,990
IBM touches nearly five years ago in

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,570
2012 the renewed program of design at

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,240
IBM was launched at that time quite

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:16,270
frankly it was a really rough time for

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,950
IBM IBM was struggling the headwinds

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,620
facing our company at that time were

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,890
strong and our numbers were declining as

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,760
this analyst quote suggests the market

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,650
and the industry were taking notice at

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,320
that time our chairman Ginni Rometty who

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,770
had just taken on that role placed a

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,780
huge bet that design designers and the

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,360
radically collaborative approach of

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,180
design thinking could change the way our

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,520
company works now nearly five years

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,920
later it's clear from stories like

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,350
Project monocle and from the surging

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,900
performance of IBM in the market that

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,320
Ginni Rometty bet is paying off in a

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,310
major way

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,270
we just had the pleasure of hosting

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,430
Ginny at last week at the IBM South by

00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,260
Southwest experience here she is being

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,170
interviewed by some of our designers at

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,250
on IBM community radio which is our

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:17,080
designer run radio station at IBM jenny

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:19,420
is clearly a C's design as the primary

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,970
force and the latest transformation and

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:26,230
reinvention of IBM she's one of our

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,390
biggest advocates and champions I'm just

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,150
about out of time here we're thrilled

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,270
again to be a part of O'Reilly design

00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,670
this year we have a booth in the expo so

00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,380
please stop by and say hi and talk to us

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,540
a little bit more many of our great

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,340
designers are here doing individual
