if I were an alien and I would come down

00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:08,480
and I don't know anything about the

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,610
human humans and our like wanted to get

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,810
an understanding about what is what is

00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,269
the difference between an engineer or

00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,029
designer or what what do they do and I

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:19,130
just I didn't language I just observed

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,519
I'll just tell you that I see to defy

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:26,150
see people drawing boxes with arrows and

00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,039
lines right and they draw a little bit

00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,839
and they think about and they might talk

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,939
a little bit and then i erase a little

00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,129
bit might draw a different arrow but in

00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:36,500
the end the artifacts these are like the

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:40,789
footprints in the sand but engineers and

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,940
designers leave they look alike and so

00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:45,739
again there's so much about you know

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,589
putting yourself in the shoes of the

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:51,289
person even if even passively even if

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:53,510
you don't put in even if you don't

00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,760
encode again what then mentioned earlier

00:00:53,510 --> 00:01:00,530
over comprehensive documentation right

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,320
yeah even the sort of the decisions you

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,000
make in drawing the diagram reflects

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,990
what's in what mental models you have

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,480
and so I would argue that it that that

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,730
if I you know if I blurry out a lot of

00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,400
the sort of the words I honestly don't

00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,650
think that anybody would really know the

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,600
difference is so I think you know the

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:26,240
point here is that that we've got a

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,060
strong inference that the cognitive

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,010
process that engineers use in the

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:36,610
cognitive process that designers use

00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,610
