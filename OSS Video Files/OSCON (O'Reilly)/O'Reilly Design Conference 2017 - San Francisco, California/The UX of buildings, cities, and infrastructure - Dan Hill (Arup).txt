mobility is increasingly something you

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,069
can imagine working a neighborhood scale

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,870
most neighborhoods don't need uber must

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:11,480
be clear uber after a global system

00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:14,210
works for a tiny one percent if that is

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,890
my view most people don't leave the move

00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,539
around outside the city that they're in

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,520
you don't also need it to work in

00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:22,039
Seattle and Shanghai it could work just

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,510
fine in Oakland so these autonomous

00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,949
shuttles are kind of increasingly

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,260
interesting and particularly because the

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:29,660
effects they have on streetscapes you

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,859
could take eighty percent of private

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,170
vehicles off the road if you had a

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,879
shared autonomous shuttle this is ETH

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,460
traffic engineering so this is leaving

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:41,269
aside some minor issues our own cultural

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:43,280
identity driving ownership of cars

00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:45,620
status symbols all of that stuff which

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,359
are very real of course nonetheless from

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,920
pure kind of transport planning punch me

00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,929
in terms of getting people around a

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,149
shared autonomous shuttle which we might

00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:58,370
call public transport they need to

00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,780
reinvent the wheel here basically it

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,280
would be very interesting now stuff we

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,049
have done is then well how does that how

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,369
do you how do you call that thing you

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:07,640
know how do you get people into it so

00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,850
this is a little film we made it's an ax

00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,170
in my team that's my old watch I'm just

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,080
saying you know she's going from here to

00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,550
there maybe she trades up time against

00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,110
money because she could pick a couple of

00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,300
people upon the way she should have said

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,800
kay was sharing so then she goes outside

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,600
but then it turns out you probably need

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,190
some kind of totem in the streets that

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,020
might be doing this but then becomes a

00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,310
bus stop on demand just for a minute or

00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,230
so good because you want it to be as

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,000
close to where she is as possible but by

00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:34,700
making it physical instead of getting

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,120
one person into that excuse the bad

00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,490
acting from my colleagues hazard

00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,880
it's not what I pay them for so to be

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:44,410
clear that you get three people in one

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,570
vehicle instead of three people in three

00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:49,300
vehicles so you need that kind of thing

00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,560
in an urban system I think we then work

00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,060
through well what would that mean for a

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,470
streetscape streets become more like the

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,460
axes or platters instead of streets

00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,860
which is interesting how would that feel

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,680
so there's this constant flow in our

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:04,840
autonomous mobility situation ironically

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,180
that's Lloyd cities used to be this is

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,290
George tree in sydney in 1906 san

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,119
francisco would have looked very similar

00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,920
they see there's a constant flow of

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,960
trams there people are flowing over the

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,340
streets in all directions everything is

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,560
constantly moving there's this lovely

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,330
kind of pattern to the to the movement

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,520
there that's the kind of thing we could

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,990
unlock and what the streets look like

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,340
well this is one of our projects but was

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,670
an inspiration for one this is by the

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,650
dutch architects MVR RDV is that a

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,760
street you know is in an a in a

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,380
neighborhood development where you don't

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,400
need that number of private vehicles

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,960
going through you just need an

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,670
autonomous shuttle picking people about

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,340
the barrack or bikes on walking that'll

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,310
do it so your streets become gardens in

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,420
this case so I call this principle like

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,420
check in city out

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,330
