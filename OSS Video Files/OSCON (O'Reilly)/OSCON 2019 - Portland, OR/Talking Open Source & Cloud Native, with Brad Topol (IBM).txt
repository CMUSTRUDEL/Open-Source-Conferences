what types of cloud native applications

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,319
run on IBM cloud and can you share some

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,130
lessons absolutely

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,019
so our our key applications we have very

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,859
large rental car companies very large

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,570
airlines that use our IBM cloud and then

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,960
the big one that we can really use to

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:24,630
test it is the weather company so the

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,630
weather company on a given day will have

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,910
30 billion unique users hit it's

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,529
information for weather forecasting and

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,780
provides weather forecasting all over

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,350
the world and when there's a storm like

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,800
a hurricane imminent that will ramp up

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,230
from 30 billion to a hundred billion

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,000
unique users every day using that

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,780
information and the system was

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,700
responsible for 250 billion individual

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,480
forecasts for like a two kilowatt

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,100
kilometer grid across the world so when

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,699
you have those types of applications

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,210
running an IBM cloud scalability is huge

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,450
so we have scalability security and

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,700
DevOps we found are critical and and

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,020
that's how we've battled tested our

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,810
cloud through those those key

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,729
applications and so looking at the kind

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,830
of the whole ecosystem how do you see

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,659
cloud native or which cloud native

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,570
technologies I guess do you see coming

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,540
together to provide the most benefit yes

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,530
so the key technology is that that we

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,780
see coming together would be kubernetes

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:33,360
ISTE O&K native if you put those three

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,920
cloud native technologies together what

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,710
we're seeing is they actually provide a

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,229
platform a platform for people to build

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,820
their cloud native applications on very

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,880
analogous to how we used to have the

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,670
WebSphere platform say eight to ten

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,500
years ago so they come together and they

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,049
help to build an applicant wonderful

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,030
cloud native applications that scale you

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,460
recently announced a new open source

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,950
project called cabin narrow can you talk

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,070
a little bit about how that

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,610
into the correct tool ecosystem yes sure

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:10,099
so carbon arrow comes from the idea that

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,700
we have a lot of say j2ee application

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,870
developers java application developers

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,879
that were used to having certain

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,160
frameworks and only having to worry

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,780
about their code and we now want them to

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,120
be able to migrate over and build cloud

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,090
native applications but there's still a

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,310
lot of complexity as you start and and

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,750
do cloud native applications so their

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,690
complexity with the networking

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,580
complexity with the security the goal of

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,069
Carbonero is to be able to give an

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,170
on-ramp to those types of application

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,880
developers to start building cloud

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,250
native applications and very very

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,650
quickly providing them a platform that

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,220
makes it much easier it also provides

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,349
certain application stacks so if some of

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,510
your application developers are not-- or

00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,049
some of your application developers are

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,569
was for liberty the Carbonaro project

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:01,489
provides those specific stacks the elite

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,370
architect can provide to the developers

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,350
and again with this whole goal of

00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,230
accelerating the development of

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:11,840
applications by those developers who are

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,530
now moving to cloud native and so when

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,299
you're talking to say a CTO can you

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,459
share your approach and how you

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,400
communicate the benefits of cloud native

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,829
mm-hmm yeah so when we talked to the CTO

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,840
one of my favorite approaches is to

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,690
start and talking to talk about what are

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,840
called 12 factor apps 12 factor apps is

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,790
a well-known standard way to build

00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,030
applications that will run on the cloud

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,069
that are scalable and robust and with 12

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,130
factor apps you have basic principles

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:47,810
that say Oh have have different steps

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:49,430
for for build and deploy so for example

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,109
you don't go out and patch the images

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,840
because if you go patch the images

00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,609
you'll lose you'll lose what happened so

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,280
you get good rules about putting

00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:00,500
everything in a source code repository

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,900
making things scalable having multiple

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,299
copies and being a resilient to failures

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,549
and so after you give that wonderful

00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:10,849
explanation of how important 12 factor

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,989
apps are you can then look at talking to

00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,790
the CTO and showing them the

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,729
capabilities of kubernetes

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,000
and an addition our products and how

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:22,220
they make it incredibly easy based on

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,440
the capabilities of kubernetes and what

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,530
we also provide to essentially build

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,500
what are twelve factor apps and so to

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,150
close on a more personal note you've

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,789
written a couple of books on an open

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,740
stack and went on kubernetes can you

00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:38,270
talk a little bit about that experience

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,910
and what you learned from writing those

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,919
books yes so yeah I've had the pleasure

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,440
of working with O'Reilly on on two

00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,509
different books and they've been

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,970
wonderful experiences I think what

00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:51,770
people need to understand is you don't

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,370
get half a year to write a book you get

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,430
about six to eight weeks and so in doing

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,910
it twice I always recommend that people

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,430
pick some co-authors that have different

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,320
strengths than theirs so maybe me

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,990
personally I'm a really strong writer

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,849
but maybe I knew somebody who really

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,530
knew I'd be in public cloud and maybe I

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:14,630
knew somebody who really knew IBM

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,340
private cloud and you can get a really

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,810
good result by not trying to pick people

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,699
who are just like you but actually

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,340
people who are many ways different in

00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:24,740
different strengths and the other thing

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,860
I recommend to people is even if you're

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,409
not the best writer companies like

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,360
O'Reilly they have wonderful editors who

00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:34,099
are going to fix a lot of stuff so the

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,960
first thing is don't be scared if you

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,610
feel like you're not the best writer

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,800
that'll all get fixed later

00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,990
what's important is worrying about being

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,150
able to talk about the technology in a

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,860
way that's very easy to understand work

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,110
hard to motivate what you're trying to

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,599
explain to your reader and if you can do

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,070
that and you can do it quickly it gets a

00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,560
little bit stressful in those six to

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,169
eight-week periods but it really is

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,760
rewarding to write books and and be able

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:01,010
to to share your knowledge in that

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,990
fashion thank you very much for talking

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,990
