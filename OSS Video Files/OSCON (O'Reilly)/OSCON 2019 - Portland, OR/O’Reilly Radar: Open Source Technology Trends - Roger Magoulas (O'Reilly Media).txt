	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,250
I have a really dense presentation I

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,529
thought I'd easy in with a video notice

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,590
a date and four days nature's gonna rock

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,630
these peoples world imagine trying to

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,450
make sense of this as 1906 there's no

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,029
mass-produced cars yet this is Market

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,760
Street in San Francisco it's anarchy

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,740
there's horses there's cars there's the

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,060
trolley try to make sense of what's

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,560
going to happen in the future you know

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,420
that there's change in the air and

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,890
that's what we try to do what radar try

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
to figure out what's going to change and

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,790
what's gonna stay the same

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,620
go down market now not too many horses a

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,700
little more regulation a little lost

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,190
anarchy but it's about just as fast so

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,340
radar has been part of O'Reilly since

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,020
the beginning and we've been in front of

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,850
a lot of trends including the open

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,469
source trend and we do a lot of trend

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,300
analysis we really mix a lot of

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:52,620
qualitative and quantitative and we

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,690
talked a lot of people we have an

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,710
amazing social network I know many of

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,370
the people in the audience and I've been

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,629
coming to ask on since 2003 and we

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,809
really appreciate all that you guys

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,240
contribute so I'm gonna start with the

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,490
proposals so we do a text analysis of

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
them and we try to look for what's going

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,159
on now we actually make you know

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,460
recommendations of what we're looking

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,320
for

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,909
but we still try to extract what's going

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,549
on and one of things we're seeing is a

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,810
holistic of look at cloud and you'll see

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,659
that's gonna be supported and some of

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,000
the later data we show the other thing

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,700
that's going on is data is central to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,619
the open source story after open source

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,049
is the second most important term in the

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,939
proposals we're happy to see that

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,560
community is kind of on the rise we're

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,350
seeing that more often and we know that

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,509
open source is all about community the

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,720
biggest rising thing in there is ml and

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,829
AI increasingly a part of the equation

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,659
and what we'll see in the rest of the

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,210
data is that there's a lot of maturing

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,770
going on there languages are more in a

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,939
support role and I think that what's

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,060
going on is we're going up the stack

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,590
that languages help what's going on but

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,600
early offs cons folks a lot of that

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,810
we're now focused more on how to make

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,680
things so the learning platform is this

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,509
great sensor it's big so we think that

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,860
the data is somewhat representative but

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,379
there is bias in the data and it's

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,260
probably towards large companies when we

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:13,600
look at the industries almost everyone

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,850
looks

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,350
same but we also have a mix of people

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,540
including business and managers and

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,630
stuff that helped influence what you're

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,690
going to see now I'm gonna start with

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,130
search search is kind of the it'd of

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,960
what we think a platform is doing like

00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,280
what people are looking for obviously

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,470
and striving to learn more about I'm

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,280
gonna say think about the maturity like

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,420
new things tend to get more looks and

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,890
complexity more complex things require

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,460
more looks when you look at this data

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,750
search also is a very long tail now I'm

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,180
going to presenting a lot of charts like

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:51,760
this so I just want to explain it quick

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,190
first there's the term topic or term

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,860
we've got rank they're usually in a rank

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,510
order the magnitude that's how big it is

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,240
so we can see python is bigger than Java

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,490
in this slide and then we've got the

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,160
rate of change year-over-year Green is

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,620
positive red is negative and the scale

00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,180
does change as I show these charts so

00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,010
these are the top search terms remember

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,990
there's two million of them so these are

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,580
just the top 11 and the first thing

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,220
notice is kubernetes that's gonna be a

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,730
story we're gonna be repeating here it's

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:25,450
a very popular growing topic for us the

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:27,550
Java this is all share Java share is

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,140
going down a little bit it's still a

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,010
really important language but it's

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,340
something we're going to pay attention

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,040
to and I'm the kind of downside we're

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,630
seeing ml down and spark and we think

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,460
this is part of the maturing process

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,360
remember this is search so we're going

00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,010
to get into that what's moving a lot the

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,850
things that we're seeing that have the

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:52,870
biggest changes and the cloud story so

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:56,500
we see a lot going on with cloud and the

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,330
growth they're helping explain the

00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,710
decline in machine learning is that

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,030
these two important machine land topics

00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,240
are getting a little less search traffic

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,390
I think people are more engaged and

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,820
blockchain is really important we think

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,820
a lot of it but it is faddish and so it

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,320
goes up and down in engagement so when

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,160
we go into deep dive now we're looking

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:21,220
at Python in the context of all sorts of

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
searches not just those top searches and

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,520
what we see here is again more evidence

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,139
about kubernetes popularity cloud native

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,289
evidence of the holistic looking at the

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,639
cloud and people thinking about

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,949
containers and orchestration and so

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,210
forth

00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:39,629
now in this case we're seeing this kind

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,669
of funny semantic change ai is becoming

00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:44,669
a more popular term from a smaller base

00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:46,379
than machine learning and the new stuff

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:47,699
we have is helping support that and

00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:50,310
you'll see that in the usage data as

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,759
well and from a tiny base open-source is

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:56,280
also increasingly showing up there so

00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,560
people said open source one we see it

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,169
more and more never go to usage this is

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
more about engagement this is actual

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,150
people in the titles and it's based on a

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,919
taxonomy and when I showed things like

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,840
Java and Python they're more complete

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,520
than in search so job includes spring

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,849
and all that stuff javascript includes

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,259
all the frameworks so security and we're

00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:17,580
really happy to see that because we've

00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,020
been trying to promote security in the

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,780
context of the O'Reilly conferences a

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,009
lot and we're seeing that there's good

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,440
growth there and you'll see what's kind

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:29,159
of behind that more evidence of the

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,740
cloud oriented things growing and well

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,949
not going as high a I and ml is still on

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,180
the growth side when we look at the

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:40,289
things that are moving up too fast we

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,880
see three security related topics more

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:44,069
evidence of the cloud I mean you can see

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,050
why we put cloud first on that that

00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:49,159
first slide we look at what's cooling

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,810
off the fat again dying out a little bit

00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:53,520
but the kind of second-tier languages

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,289
and as you'll see on the next slide we

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,449
see some consolidation going on

00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,370
and lastly mobile dev it's not that

00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:03,020
people aren't developing for mobile it's

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,430
that it's just called development so

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,860
these are this is the languages in rank

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,880
order and what we see is that the big

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:15,770
three are kind of consolidating usage

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,940
and we're looking at Kotlin and rough as

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,259
growing language was kind of something

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,969
new and something old C is still hanging

00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:26,940
in there and still an important and

00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:28,139
growing language for us and we just

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,699
heard a little about Microsoft being

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,259
part of it the Microsoft languages are

00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,800
also getting increased traction from a

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:38,099
pretty tiny base this is a little hard

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,930
to explain but this is correlated so if

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:42,650
someone is looking at job

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,900
and what other languages do they look at

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,639
so in the first case where a Python Java

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,100
would be the next post language and we

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,360
noticed something kind of funny here but

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,190
we also noticed something else kind of

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,500
funny when you look at the correlated

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:00,270
language so Python is popular in that

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,580
way but it's also the most insular

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,050
language of these languages in that the

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,300
next language people look at is Java but

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,430
it's a much smaller percentage than the

00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,840
other ones we're not really sure why but

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,620
we have some guesses and if you have

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,810
some guesses let me know the thing is

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,180
some what to do it a I and ml somewhat

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,800
that is taught in schools and somewhat

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,289
that it's easy to use and that some

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,520
people are just using Python as kind of

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,050
a glue and they're not like full-time

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,060
programmers but they're using it to help

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,060
them get work done

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,500
now the AI ml binding is important so

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,510
I'm just back to search for this one

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,849
slide and then we look at the deep dive

00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,039
how many searches for Python Java and

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:40,320
JavaScript include ml and AI terms and

00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,330
Python is an order of magnitude more

00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,830
presence there and clearly it's the

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,940
popular language for most of the

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,830
bindings and work that people are doing

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,090
in machine learning so let's talk a

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,570
little more about machine learning and

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:59,240
here's more evidence of that semantic

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:01,199
shift where we see AI growing a lot and

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,970
machine learning shrinking and and

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,979
they're all the other ones are all down

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:10,520
but we see natural language processing

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:13,020
as in a way staying holding its ground

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,280
we think NLP is going to be something

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,210
that people are going to increasingly

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,650
use machine learning for and just for it

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,300
as we're also seeing kind of a shift in

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,180
what people are looking at high torques

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,370
is growing reinforcement is growing from

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,930
small bases this is part of them at the

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,550
maturity story that we see so this is a

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,760
bunch of cloud things put together on

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:38,370
usage and we see evidence we saw it in

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,750
the proposals and here of migration

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:45,270
monolith to microservices going on so

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,709
we're seeing the growth there now we see

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,959
an inverse relationship between the

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:51,420
smaller of the big three cloud providers

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,940
growing faster and stuff but it's

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,180
clearly a big

00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:01,790
a big pool and rising tide and everyone

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:03,380
is growing a lot and I gave a lot of

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,630
data so I thought I should summarize it

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,010
quickly open source is everywhere when I

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,740
did the search terms eleven of the

00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,270
fourth no 11 of the top 14 search terms

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,990
were open source or he looked at usage

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,970
it was mostly around open source this we

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,010
have a paper on next architecture coming

00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,270
out soon covering what we're seeing

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,280
around this holistic approach to the

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,020
cloud we have the big three languages

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,570
we're paying attention to Kotlin and

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,910
Russ to see the traction they get Python

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,360
is different and that's of course

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,070
interesting to us while we see a I and

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,300
ml in a kind of a plateau from an

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,740
engagement we know that people are

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,270
moving more towards production and

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,910
there's an increasingly part of the

00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:47,890
ASEAN and ops and all sorts of worlds

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,890
and that Microsoft is still in the mix

00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:55,839
