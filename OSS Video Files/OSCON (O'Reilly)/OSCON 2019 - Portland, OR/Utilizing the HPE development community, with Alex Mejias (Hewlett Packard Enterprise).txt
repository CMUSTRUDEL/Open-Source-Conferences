hi Alex what is hpe dev yes o h PE dev

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,120
is a short for h PE developer community

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,550
of so we shortened just a little bit

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,650
because it's kind of a mouthful it's a

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,770
place where we've sort of curated h PE s

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,690
open source for our products and

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,430
developers can go there and find all of

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,470
our technical content we have a really

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,019
popular blog there that we're constantly

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,150
pushing out technical content you know

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,630
developers can actually create content

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:32,850
on our portal to publish blogs and so

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,500
it's it's sort of a home for for hp's

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,960
open source and a way for us to sort of

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,469
engage a community around building and

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,050
how are developers using it yes so it's

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,350
a lot of our customers who purchase our

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,550
servers which come bundled with software

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,190
and that software is something like

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,230
1-view and so we will write open source

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,879
packages that all sort of enable the

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,760
developer to extend the product a bit

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,309
these are things that are you know

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,890
language bindings so we'll do an SDK for

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,250
say Python so you can you know

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,930
effortlessly communicate with the api's

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,930
if you're a Python developer we try to

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,990
cover all the major languages and in our

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,450
open source and what can you share some

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,280
of the most exciting HPE products you're

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,799
working on right now sure yeah you know

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,970
that now's a great time because we just

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,799
recently announced that we're kind of

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,420
moving our whole portfolio to as a

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,400
service right and so that means that

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,829
there's a whole new load of applications

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,810
that are coming out with API so for me

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,430
as someone who's building on our API is

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,659
I think that that's really excited you

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,240
know one of those is Green Lake hybrid

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,979
cloud but you know anytime there's a new

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,960
API introduced I get really excited

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,720
because I can build all these new open

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,970
source packages around these api's and

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,600
can you tell us how developers can join

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,060
your community

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,950
sure yeah they can visit developer HPE

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,210
comm and that's going to be our

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,040
developer portal where you can find

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,040
pretty much all of our content other

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,900
than what's on github

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,090
and there's a sign up there to join the

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,530
community all right thank you very much

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,530
