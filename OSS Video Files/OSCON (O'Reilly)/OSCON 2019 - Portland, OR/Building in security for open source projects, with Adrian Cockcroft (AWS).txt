how is your open source team grown over

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,720
the last year and what are some of your

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,400
new areas of focus we've been growing

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,530
the team for a little while this is a

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,330
third time we've been at OSCON first

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,950
time we're here there were just two or

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,810
three of us they're desperately trying

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,039
to get run a new event the this size

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,630
last year we had a good team in place

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,080
and this year we've grown it quite a bit

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,720
more most significantly we now have

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,429
Peter Holanda who's joined me to act as

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,140
the basic general manager for open

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,719
source dedicated to running the team

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,280
team got to be big enough that having

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,890
the more report to me was getting a bit

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,260
too much so we've got another level of

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,329
management and a more dedicated leader

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,530
for open source he joined us in February

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,110
it's been around for a while he was at

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:53,430
Sun when they open source java it's a

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,680
Ren Ren Ren part of that program and it

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:59,640
was involved in a whole series of things

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,850
around cloud comm and patchy cloud stack

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,220
was involved in that and some things

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,020
more around OpenStack recently and then

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,229
he was looking for an interesting new

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,540
challenge and joined the team so we've

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,000
added people with specializations in a

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,830
broader set of areas so that generally

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,280
that's what I've been gradually growing

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,080
the team to cover more there's so many

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,939
different specializations such a broad

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,119
area and open source that you need lots

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:30,329
of lots of different experts to cover it

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:32,159
and available source software licenses

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,909
have been discussed a lot recently

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,880
what's a WSS position on that we feel

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,009
that we want to keep open source as open

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,630
source and it's fine to have an

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,700
available source license that kind of

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,040
just a proprietary license with some

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,979
disclosure and generally if you're

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,290
creating a new new project pick a

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:58,170
license

00:01:51,290 --> 00:02:00,390
the real the the thing you don't want to

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,920
do is take a license and make it more

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,509
restrictive like if you're going to

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,880
realizin something you should make it

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:08,160
more permissive and that generally is is

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,770
what people people see that that is a

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,140
good thing to do and there's a number of

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,819
places where we've acquired some

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,860
company or some technology and we've

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,950
worked to relicense things to observe a

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,350
more permissive license but if you take

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,020
an open-source project and move it to an

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,940
available source project you're actually

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,040
making it more restrictive and if you

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,900
previously could contribute it something

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,459
to that project only on the assumption

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,380
they would say Apache license or

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,970
something and now it's a proprietary

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,340
piece of software you've sort of given

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,140
your feedback into something that you

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,239
don't have you know the right to use it

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,520
has been modified by whoever modified

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,820
that license so that's I think that's a

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,220
move that we that doesn't feel like it's

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,440
in the spirit of open source so we we've

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,480
been sort of pushing back a little bit

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,370
in those kinds of areas and sort of

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,709
building our own alternatives to areas

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,989
where somebody's taken something and

00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,760
built you know useful functionality but

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,070
it's not available to everybody to use

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,610
we've done more sort of contributing our

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,989
own versions of those that capability

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,519
and can you share some of the more

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,530
interesting open-source projects you're

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,300
working on right now yeah well in the

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,440
last year we've released a few few

00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,660
things one of the most one of the most

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,110
interesting ones is firecracker it's a

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,510
micro virtualization that layered and

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,190
cut it little tall white people if you

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,950
got exactly what we've done here but

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,500
it's um it's basically a very

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,930
lightweight layer that controls KVM to

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,150
give you the ability to create a virtual

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,480
machine in very very short period of

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,730
time and then to start up a new

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,400
container or a function for it's a

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,320
service environment and but with all of

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,959
the protection you'd have from a virtual

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,370
machine whereas containers really don't

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,049
have the same protection boundary

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,239
between them when they were running on

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:59,100
the machine so it gives you that at some

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,900
of the core technology we've used in

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,910
Fargate and AWS lambda and we wanted to

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,910
share it back with the community so

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,160
build on it so far we've had engagements

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:15,289
with container D cata containers and

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,729
more recently we've worked built a

00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:19,440
system on top that makes it sort of

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,329
actually behave a bit like docker so it

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,400
becomes a plugin for a kazoo

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,830
Tayna runtime but it's a virtual machine

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,800
runtime just like going round in circles

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,300
here in terms of the functionality but

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,560
I've been get really happy to see the

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,840
pickup of that tour the other couple of

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,639
big ones one was Java with the careto

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,229
launch where big users of Java and there

00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,849
were some changes in the licensing and

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,889
support model of different versions of

00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:49,169
Java that were just awkward and we'd

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,819
want it wasn't what we wanted so we met

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,560
what we're gonna self support because

00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:54,180
we're big enough to do that and then we

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,120
said well we should actually support

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,590
that for our customers on on AWS mr

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,090
actually we just need to support it for

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,669
anybody that wants to use Java on

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,509
anywhere so we ended up coming up with a

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,849
a distribution of open JDK that has full

00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:10,580
AWS support for basically all the

00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,560
platforms that you'd be interested in

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,120
and it's free a free one because we're

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,129
doing the work anyway we just want to

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,770
have a good base language to run

00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,009
everything up so that was a another case

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,300
of like the license changes and the

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,800
support change is becoming more

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,060
restrictive and it's just going that we

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,400
need we need something that's better

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,590
than that that's more helpful to our

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:38,039
customers in that area and then few more

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,479
interesting projects Marquart cdk most

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,279
people spend seems when most a time

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,319
editing yeah more files nowadays and

00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,849
then you said well I have this variable

00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,680
here I have to have some way to have

00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:48,330
variables that get passed around and

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,159
then I need to loop over something and

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,409
then you're writing loops in yeah mole

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,539
and it just gets a bit crazy after a

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:56,849
while so they when you just use an

00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,159
actual programming language that emits

00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:02,729
the amyl that does the configuration so

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:05,400
the project called CDK that we open

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,259
sourced about we launched it I think

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,599
maybe six months ago and it just held

00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,930
its first like we had a ga release on it

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,849
so I've settled it down after in public

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,620
sort of you know trying things out

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,870
getting some feedback from from people

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,379
and then we sort of settled on the final

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:25,979
spec for that so there's there's a quite

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:28,560
quite broad different projects and then

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,370
the the one of the main one that we've

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,969
done most recently is the the various

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,559
contributions to

00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:38,409
search in the open district for

00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:40,569
elasticsearch and is AWS hiring

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:43,509
specifically for positions related to

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:45,309
open source yeah we have been for a long

00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,689
time but it's actually been kind of hard

00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:49,149
to find them and we've been trying to

00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:51,819
get the various teams at AWS to tag the

00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,529
the job postings with like the word open

00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,879
source with no space in it because if

00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:57,029
you search for open source you get all

00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,719
the recruiting sourcing people it's

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:01,899
unfortunately it's not you know it

00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,759
doesn't kind of work so and we've been

00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:05,799
started listing some of them on our

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,239
website so like as we go through the

00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:08,949
team's we're gradually finding there's a

00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:11,889
lot more that we we just sort of don't

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,379
have a good way to surface but you know

00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:16,149
we're hiring people to work on that they

00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:17,979
need to work on projects but what we're

00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:20,799
really interested in is finding the jobs

00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,569
where you know part of the job spec is

00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:24,610
to contribute back to the open source

00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,389
project and there's a bunch of positions

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,729
open for things like caf-co and

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:33,309
obviously around kubernetes and lots of

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:36,399
different projects where we're we're

00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:40,119
hiring more people from the communities

00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,009
to contribute to open source and in some

00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:44,079
case we're actually hiring it the leader

00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:46,509
of a project or some of the founding

00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,279
members of projects to work at AWS to

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,849
help lead big things so that for that

00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,959
place to the the Jupiter notebook

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:56,529
systems were one of the leaders of that

00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:58,179
and in my team we hired a couple who is

00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,969
the author of cloud custodian written

00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:03,279
author of that so we're working working

00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:04,989
to manage and contribute so some

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,549
projects not just with code but with the

00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:08,679
overall sort of leadership and steering

00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:11,169
of some of these projects as well right

00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:12,969
and you mentioned the open distro for

00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:17,189
elasticsearch project how is that going

00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:21,579
it's going very well it's a interesting

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:25,169
situation we we want to take the core

00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:28,509
open source Apache License elasticsearch

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:31,479
distribution but we wanted to extend it

00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:34,870
to include security and things like that

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:38,219
security sequel querying some

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,779
performance monitoring alerting and and

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,429
we were developing these for our own

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,919
elastic search service which we've had

00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,250
since 2015

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,320
but the sort of commercial you know

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,620
software from elastic was a commercially

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,470
licensed and so we're kinda like the

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,540
open source project really needed

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,970
security so that was really what drove

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,190
this and it's become a baseline thing

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,269
now it's very difficult to justify

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:09,329
having a product you know the service or

00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:11,339
a project that manages data without

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:13,290
having security a way to encrypt that

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,420
data so it's it was like there was a lot

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,949
of pressure from the community that the

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,560
open-source version really needed to

00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:20,699
have a security solution so after sort

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,260
of going back and forth me and don't

00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:27,120
know we just have to do this so we

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,190
released our own add-on the Apache

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,720
licensed open-source version of security

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,300
and a few other features and then we

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,910
bundle it together into an easy easy to

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,480
use distribution on top of the the same

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,350
upstream version that everyone else uses

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,880
well thank you very much for talking

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,880
