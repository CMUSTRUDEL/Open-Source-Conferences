how does the Home Depot use open-source

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,109
technology at the Home Depot reviews

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,300
open source technology for over a decade

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,099
we've used Linux in our stores and we're

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,559
using technologies like cops and crew

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,630
bird IDs to power our supply chain

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,550
printing solutions and so we've also

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,740
been using it to foster the way we

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,350
develop software internally our

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,300
developers use technologies like pair

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,880
programming to build open source

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,340
software to deliver the retail software

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,859
that powers our operations and what's

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,370
the value of using and contributing to

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,809
open source in a large organization one

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,960
of the things that we like to do is give

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,280
our developers and opportunity to

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,620
contribute back to the community and so

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,239
they're able to use open source and

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,640
contribute back to those projects as

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,500
they find bugs or patches that are

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,539
useful to our environment and contribute

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,190
back to the community we also like to

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,980
learn from the open source development

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,570
models and we use a lot of the same

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,390
models that make open source software

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,579
successful in our own environment and so

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,530
things like pair programming and things

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,090
like rapid software development our

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,200
practices that we adopt in our

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,619
organization as well

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,119
and how does Home Depot benefit from the

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,090
contributions of other large

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,880
organizations one of the things that we

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,890
benefit from is using software that

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,140
works around many different industries

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,000
and so one of the things that we look

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,830
for is how of other companies solve

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,450
problems using the same open source

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,939
technology stacks that we like to use

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,799
we're a large organization with a very

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,479
large distributed environment and so we

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,250
like to look at other companies of

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,570
similar size and scale and see how

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,579
they're solving those problems and

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,290
open-source software makes that possible

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,420
because we're all using the same stock

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,280
and can you share some of the more

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,579
interesting projects you're working on

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,189
right now well earlier at OSCON there

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,710
was a session about how we're using an

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,299
older technology like cups paired with a

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,130
newer technology like Cooper energy to

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,829
solve some printing challenges in our

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,140
supply chain distribution sites and

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,060
we're also using technologies like

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,549
Cassandra and elastic and caf-co to

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,630
solve a lot of our data persistence

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,610
challenges and we even use newer

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,890
technologies like odwin spinnaker as

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,690
well to solve things like load balancing

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,930
and

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,210
deployment and how do you see the open

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,340
source technology evolving in Home Depot

00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,260
in the next few years one of the things

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,270
that we're working on is improving our

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,830
ability to contribute back to open

00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,180
source we want to release some of the

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,800
software that we've developed to solve

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,900
some of our own challenges back to the

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,120
open source community as well and we

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,930
would like to make sure that we're

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,790
engaged with the open source community

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,570
and making sure that we're contributing

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,280
either software or a bug fixes to the to

00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,260
the software that we're using and has

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,190
made us successful well thank you very

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,190
