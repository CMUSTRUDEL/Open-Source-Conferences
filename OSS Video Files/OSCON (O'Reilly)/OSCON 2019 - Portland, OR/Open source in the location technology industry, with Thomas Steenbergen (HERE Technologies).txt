what role does open-source play and

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,080
location technology and how do you see

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:14,490
that role evolving I would say for

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,080
location technology specifically like

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,970
mapping and mapping can be very

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,470
complicated and also the world is not

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,080
the same so open-source is really there

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,900
to basically connect everything together

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,349
so you have all different if a private

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,620
ecosystem or various libraries that's

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,030
basically really help you from taking

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,879
data from various sources from

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,530
government sources and it helps you then

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,739
convert or you can render it on your map

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,420
and then parse and so this is where

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:47,129
open-source is really the it helps you

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,180
the world is complex and the world

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,770
especially location and people think

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,870
devote a simple most of time non world

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,320
everybody now everything is different

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,640
and at open source you can really get

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,640
the right pieces to connect everything

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,090
together and really create beautiful

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,560
things and really get context out of

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,360
your location and very a better

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,290
understanding of a lot of others

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,369
happening and you can really use it to

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:20,250
connect the various pieces together and

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,820
I see that the the community is growing

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,229
and growing

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:27,390
even you technologies we're now slowly

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,340
increasing our presence in the

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,159
open-source community

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,259
and yeah I'm really looking forward to

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,420
do the work that's coming and like this

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,600
year we will make further announcements

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
in the open source space and yeah and so

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,790
far the community has been added great

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,369
like especially the people that were in

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:51,509
the application space it's been so

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,070
welcoming to us basically doing more

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,200
things in it in the open source space

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,299
can you talk a little bit more about

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,790
here technology's contributions to open

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:06,150
source so to of course be your

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:10,240
location company so most of the people

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:13,230
know us from our Maps so we recently

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,480
open sourced an entry mapping engine

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,030
called harp GL which is based on untrue

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
and 3GS and that's we can use to render

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,490
maps on the web that's one of the things

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,520
with your shown here at OSCON but we're

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:30,040
also basically as as a company we also

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,950
want to be a good open source citizen so

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,130
we also have projects like for instance

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,760
operational toolkit which is a project

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,590
that allows you to see the the licenses

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,610
and security vulnerabilities for your

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,990
open source and it's completely open

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,700
source and then we have that project for

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:52,450
instance we work together in a polymer

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,190
project called clearly defined and so

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,610
we're really trying to and that that

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:59,290
project is focused on on basically

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,910
getting the open source data on licenses

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,630
and scanning em so we what we're really

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:08,050
trying to do is be a good open source

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,060
citizen and really look at where what

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:14,590
can we do to help the open source

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:19,030
community and yeah it's so far it is it

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,550
has been it's been great and I said

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,070
we're relatively early in our journey

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,989
but we we have some projects already

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:30,550
that are that are really kicking off and

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:32,260
really becoming bigger and bigger so

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,120
yeah that's that it's that's our main

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,769
process or main projects that I would

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,739
say the two ones we have we have a lot

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:42,880
more but that's the one things - - ones

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:46,660
that I mostly focus on for now and so

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,070
there's more to come what what projects

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:52,840
are you most excited about right now

00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:54,550
most excited I have so many things that

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,660
like yes it's really funny me is how

00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,310
about my source you would think that I

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,790
mostly do management and i'ma stuff but

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,760
I actually I am an open source guy so I

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:08,320
actually work in countries and for the

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,040
project so yeah so my own like one of

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,379
the on projects so

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,700
option look it I actually contributed

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:18,910
that I actually write some of the

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:22,340
front-end code but also and as I said I

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,350
work on and clearly find collaboration I

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,889
work in the India to do group so to do

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:29,300
group is a working group and arrangement

00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,310
issue where companies work together of a

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,660
source so one of the things where I'm

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,520
contributing we live to is basically

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,430
really helping companies specifically in

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,320
Europe to learn more about open source

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,479
like it's there's no manual for for

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,120
companies or large organizations to do

00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:47,000
open source so I'm contributing a lot to

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,979
basically help cut these companies come

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,750
on board understand open source how

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,770
others do is like there especially for

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,270
companies there are some other

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,910
challenges that people might realize

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,979
like how do you contribute a company at

00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,660
scale what every we have thousands of

00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:02,240
developers that want to contribute how

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,949
do you how do you how do you do that and

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,680
so that's that's one of the things that

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,750
I'm working together and we really have

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,180
a good collaboration so our contributors

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,419
to that space are our borsch Siemens

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,030
as AP and and together with them they

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,190
were basically really trying to create a

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,050
platform or basically companies that

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,560
want to do open source but really do not

00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,330
know how to do it and first stuff to

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,220
believe to say like hey here are other

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,470
companies already have done it we have

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,180
meetings every 90 days come and join us

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,010
and any question you have do you come

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,930
join so that's one of my contributions

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,650
were fronted with a lots on

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,270
documentation and onboarding outreach so

00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,220
it's not only code that I contribute but

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,110
also like a like that is also there's

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,360
also the community aspects like not all

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,849
contributions have to be code you can

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,770
also perfectly contribute by this

00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,449
contribute documentation or basically

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,849
making the connections or do public

00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:58,970
speaking those are also contortions

00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:01,610
right and so taking a broader view how

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,479
do you expect to see open source evolve

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,460
over the next few years I would say I

00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,010
think that one of the trends that I'm

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,930
currently seeing is that basically as

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,800
most people know suffers eating

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:18,440
everything but what you now see is that

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,409
the big industrial players which you

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,860
never imagined so these are like - these

00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:25,910
are companies that usually

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,850
make shape things out of metal the and

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:32,040
that you would normally not expect to to

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,450
basically all of sudden become

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,590
open-source friendly but that that's the

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,820
trend that we're now seeing that

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,860
basically industrial players like I

00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,350
recently had a conversation one of the

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,290
companies that was pivoting they make

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,510
pressure valves and then you don't

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,790
realize that yeah they're software for

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,860
these perfect files and it's a fish and

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:55,590
yeah that that's actually is powered by

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,850
Linux and so that's what you now see is

00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,270
that companies that you would never

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,370
expect that you think all this is all

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,350
just metal parts and all its position

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,420
parts no there's a lot of sovereign volt

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,130
and you cannot see these companies also

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,450
becoming aware of open source and

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,090
understanding the importance of open

00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,910
source so and then what you don't see is

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,800
that and then the next thing is like

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,660
things that you never imagine like oh

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,740
this is now also becoming open source

00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,210
and like pretty like oh I never expected

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,420
that there could be open so yeah it's

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,180
it's like open source is the perfect

00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:35,040
method to collaborate together and the

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,990
world is a complex place so open source

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,500
is the peripheral fuel for that to

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,960
basically reuse block P things that

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,920
already there so that basically you can

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,080
offer solutions for the complex problems

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,250
that we have in this world well thank

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,250
