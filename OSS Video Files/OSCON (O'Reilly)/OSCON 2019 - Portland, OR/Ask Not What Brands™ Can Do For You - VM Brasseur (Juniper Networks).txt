	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,970
so as a company that wants to get

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,950
started in free and open source software

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,859
if you are that company what do you do I

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,300
mean yes there are bullies you would

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,490
like to avoid them but this open source

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,099
stuff it's so cool that even Microsoft

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,440
oh my god Microsoft what the heck

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,970
Microsoft is doing it now so it must be

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,539
great and you want to be there you want

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,750
to be like that so what do you do you

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,630
make it up you don't have the guidance

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,949
required but you do your best no one

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,170
ever bothered to explain to you about

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,550
the four freedoms so you just assume

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,500
free means the price of the software

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,960
what else could it possibly mean after

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,360
all there's no one to tell you about the

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
open source definition so you think you

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,110
know what open source means and you just

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,579
go charging on ahead I know what open

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,030
source is you just put the source code

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,660
out there that's all you need right

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:52,949
again I have seen this so so many times

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,449
versus a community member and later as a

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,520
freelancer working with these companies

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,340
to get them back onto the right path

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,840
right a path that not only leads to

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,660
being a great free and open source

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,000
software citizen but also not

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,100
coincidentally to profitability and

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,659
company success but the lack of

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,430
awareness by the free and open source

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,560
software world the lack of awareness or

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,650
support or guidance for these companies

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,040
is unintentionally causing problems for

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,360
the movement we love so much so what can

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,130
we do about it

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,009
all you people I can't see because the

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,920
lights are really bright what can we do

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,110
about this how can we help and support

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,579
these companies they try to find their

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,720
way on this new path well for starters

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,759
try to pay more attention to the

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,579
companies that are doing it today and

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,130
trying to do it right right and give

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,590
them the credit they deserve for that

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,119
each and every one of you should be

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:55,049
screaming huzzah at Microsoft for making

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:58,110
such a colossal change in their culture

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,600
because that is difficult to build

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,850
something great you need a really strong

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,890
foundation and these companies can form

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,060
that for the commercial side a free and

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,060
open source software in the

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,890
21 years of open-source so listen to the

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,290
keynotes on stages like this visit those

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,930
booths down there in the expo hall and

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,700
hear actually hear the open-source

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,260
stories that these companies are trying

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,150
to tell you yes yes I will admit a lot

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,060
of it comes off as fluffy marketing

00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,130
nonsense and propaganda absolutely but

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,050
you know how that happens that happens

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,000
because no one bothered to tell you the

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,260
language of open-source so you use the

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,510
language you have some of it also comes

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,760
across simply as a company trying to

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,470
make money well folks

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,980
newsflash their companies that's what

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,410
they do or at least they try they don't

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,200
always succeed so if they can also do

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,320
that though while also being excellent

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,510
free and open source software citizens

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,460
we should be encouraging that that's

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,760
amazing I mean late-stage capitalism

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,770
really really sucks yes but I'm just

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,130
foolishly optimistic enough to believe

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:14,380
that together we can evolve it to become

00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,580
a so a a force for social good the next

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,790
thing you can do is keep your eye open

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,980
for these newcomers as they are entering

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,030
free and open-source software these are

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,350
the companies that are just getting

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,570
started they might be a little harder to

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,010
spot because they might not be very

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,230
public about their involvement yet

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,209
remember those beliefs you'd like to

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,430
dunk them as much as possible they leave

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,209
their signs though they might quietly

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:39,730
launch a repo and get lab or github they

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,620
may send a pull request or project

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,480
you're a maintainer of or perhaps it

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,690
could be as simple as sending a question

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,720
to your mailing list notice these things

00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,270
and reach out doesn't take much to open

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,970
the door to these newcomers who start a

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,250
dialogue to help them feel welcome and

00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,050
free and open-source software and that

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,070
gives you the opportunity to help guide

00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,070
them along the right path

00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,640
