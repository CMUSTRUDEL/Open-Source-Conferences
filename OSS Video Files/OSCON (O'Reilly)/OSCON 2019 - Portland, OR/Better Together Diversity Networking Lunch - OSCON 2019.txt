let me just start by saying that is an

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,230
absolute pleasure to be here with you

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,230
all today so welcome everybody to the

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,090
diversity lunch I'm here joined by my

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,730
colleague Adam Al and we are going to

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,340
talk to you about non cult contributions

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,289
as a road to diversity and inclusion let

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,270
me also just point out that we have two

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,760
microphones in the room so at the end of

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,470
our presentation we are going to take

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,060
some questions if you if you want to

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,630
continue the discussions thank you Thank

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,210
You Joanna

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,460
and my name is eijah mal Norma marcozzi

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,250
and from Kyrgyzstan and I'm a program

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,550
manager and I contribute to a couple of

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,649
open source projects and I'm a commuter

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,039
in one of them which is Apache air flow

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,219
as was mentioned before and in this

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,949
communities I advocate for documentation

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,770
and recognition of non code

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,199
contributions and the other thing that I

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,500
really care about is diversity and

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,049
inclusion in tech that's fantastic and

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,869
I'm Veronica - Kara I'm also a program

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,240
manager in open source and I deeply care

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,790
about the health of our communities in

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,090
every single way as it was mentioned I'm

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,310
a pharmacist by training so I care about

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,340
the well-being and to make sure that our

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,400
communities are healthy and strong and

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,369
empowered so we've been talking about

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,040
non current contributions let's start by

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,270
understanding what non contributions

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,880
really are so non code contributions are

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,329
all the types of contributions that

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,520
don't evolve code in open source we can

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,100
define them by all the actions that we

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,159
can take in order to advance project

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,070
management our communities and all those

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,430
that care about the user and contributed

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,829
experience so as you can see we have

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,020
these three main pillars in terms of non

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,200
contributions and they very often

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,180
overlap within each other so some of the

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,920
examples just to to give you some

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,439
perspective into what are we really

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,709
talking about when we think about the

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,270
user support we think about improving

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:15,820
documentation training providing

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,980
tools that support our contributors

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,930
building to use cases for the different

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,570
technologies but also working on

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,210
communication which can go from working

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,520
on social media to blog posts to press

00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,460
releases as a whole array of different

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,470
types of communications in terms of

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,560
community management when we think about

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,170
our communities all the contributions

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,890
that can go from helping organizing

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:42,940
meetups and community oriented events

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,310
recognizing those that contribute to

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,560
open source but also we are talking

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,420
about mentorship and providing

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,850
fundraising opportunities to help

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,550
advancing our communities at a project

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:58,330
level this can go from working on new

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:02,020
releases JIRA triage but also working on

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,020
the projects roadmap so now that we have

00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,630
defined non code contributions let's

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,820
have a deep look into what diversity and

00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,710
inclusion really mean so the terms

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,190
diversity and inclusion are very often

00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,130
thrown around and my colleagues and I we

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:24,190
really like this definition by just

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:28,260
Mitchell because it says that diversity

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:32,170
is a number inclusion a process and

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,530
equity is the outcome and this quote is

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,410
just so powerful because we know that

00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,410
many of our open source communities they

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:44,050
are very diverse but I challenge you are

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,930
they truly inclusive sometimes we don't

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,600
know and unfortunately the contributor

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,360
base is very different from the user

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,070
base in open source so let's have a look

00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,890
at those numbers to see what we are

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,380
talking about when we think about the

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,740
general population and now I'm thinking

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,340
about gender imbalances let's assume

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:08,980
that all the individuals that form all

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,190
the general population identify either

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:15,370
has them as a man as a male or as a

00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:18,310
female but at the same time let's

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,270
acknowledge that all these individuals

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,640
don't sum up to a hundred percent when

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,110
we look when we narrowed it down and

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:32,720
look at the professional program

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:35,539
in into this segment only 23% are women

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,479
so it is a massive decrease that we see

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:41,870
from the overall population and then

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,419
when we look at an open source what do

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,039
you think that this number really is do

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,129
you think that you can help us here as a

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,900
mom yeah I can help you with the number

00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:56,719
there that's 3 percent that's 3 percent

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,599
of the respondents to the github server

00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:02,330
in 2017 were female

00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:05,389
95 were male and only one with

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,819
non-binary so in that's a problem of

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,490
open source like when our communities

00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,770
are not inclusive when women and

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,669
underrepresented minorities don't feel

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:20,090
safe and welcome in our communities we

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:22,430
lose a lot like we were a lot of skills

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,129
and expertise and experience that they

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,349
could bring to our projects and when we

00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:30,919
considered that increasingly a track

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:34,310
record of contributing to open source is

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,370
a requirement to get hired in tech it

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,979
has potential to make the representation

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,629
of women and underrepresented minorities

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:46,669
even worse in proprietary software so

00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:48,050
Google opens her strategy team they

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,479
wanted to understand more about

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,009
attracting new contributors to open

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,099
source the Commission's

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:58,279
studied to help us better understand why

00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:02,120
and how people do or do not contribute

00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:04,729
to open source so the goals were to

00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,060
understand who the users that approached

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:10,789
our communities and projects how they go

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,339
from just being a user to contributor

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,650
and what kind of support the project

00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:19,940
maintainer can give them in order to

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:22,490
foster healthy processes and we hope to

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,879
find answer to all of those questions

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,349
and we wanted to provide agnostic

00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,169
guidelines and document the best

00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:32,930
practices open source and we started the

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,879
process by interviewing stakeholders at

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,880
Google like whole world like software

00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:40,399
engineers tech leads technical writers

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,970
program managers who were involved in

00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,580
opens

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,010
and we were looking to understand the

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,080
challenges they had bringing new users

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,430
and contributors to their projects and

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,990
with these discussions we wanted to

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,870
understand what would be our research

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,750
goal and how the research would benefit

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:05,420
open-source projects and after those

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:07,670
discussions we selected 18 subjects we

00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,670
tried to just random and be inclusive in

00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,740
our selection process and they all came

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:20,240
from different backgrounds and different

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:23,780
experiences and and we were asking them

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,480
questions of how they choose the project

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,070
for adoption and when they use it do

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,020
they contribute back and if they don't

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:35,210
contribute back what are the reasons and

00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:39,410
what are the barriers they face and from

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,890
ours and after that we collected all

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:45,710
their stories we mapped them and perform

00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:49,160
somatic analysis to come up with these

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,160
user archetypes and open source original

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,260
there were five the first one is not

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,570
included here because those are lurkers

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,060
and they don't interact with our project

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:02,480
much and we don't know about them a lot

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,600
but the rest is here the first one is

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:09,110
widow who is very active in open source

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,120
his active voice in their local

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,120
communities they collaborate with other

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,550
leaders and they also provide a lot of

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,250
mentorship attend these conferences give

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:22,130
talks then there's convinced personas

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,870
who is convinced that their the

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,940
contribution to open source is very

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,760
valuable but they don't have enough

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,640
support from their employers that's why

00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,310
they can't contribute a lot and there's

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,099
competent persona who is very competent

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,400
he has a lot of skills and he

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:43,219
contributes code mostly bug fixes and he

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,020
thinks that that that's the only way of

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:50,720
contributing to open source and finally

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:53,930
mid Parker she's a curious persona who

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,620
is curious about open source but they

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,830
don't know

00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,220
anything about it yet so today I'm gonna

00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,950
talk a lot about curious because that's

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,740
where everyone starts I was Parker very

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,980
recently and Here I am a little bit

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:13,100
confident a little bit convinced anyway

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,470
so what she's curious about she's

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,770
curious about open source she would like

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:22,070
to use open source for her work but she

00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:25,660
faces per ears she's unfamiliar how the

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:30,080
processes art she doesn't understand

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:32,089
licensed open source licenses and she

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,160
might not even be familiar with github

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:38,360
or like how to file issues have to

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,370
submit fixes but as I said she loves the

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,850
idea of open source and she would love

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,310
to contribute back someday and because

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,310
she's not an engineer let's say she's a

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,910
data analyst she's not convinced whether

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,800
she can bring anything of value and she

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,360
might be even nervous like asking

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,610
questions and interacting in the

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,830
community because English is not her

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,380
first language it might not be even her

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,190
second spoken language and she might

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,670
even have some bad experiences like of

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,500
getting harassed in the web previously

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,630
so she needs all the support that you

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,270
can give her from the very beginning

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,029
like just telling what open source is

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,870
about showing her how the get her peers

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:28,040
are filed and she needs all that support

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:30,950
from the from you so let's go look at

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,640
the look at Parker's journey of how she

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:38,779
becomes a user of open-source so how

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,060
does she pick a project there million

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:42,800
projects and libraries available out

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,920
there and how does she choose the right

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,880
one she starts looking into available

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,850
options and once she finds some one

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,430
project that looks promising she does a

00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,640
quick assessment for fit will it work

00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,860
with her team in her environment like

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,200
she looks at the platform compatibility

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,839
the languages used and the environment

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,180
she wants to be able to quickly sift out

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,350
the projects that she fundamental

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,840
cannot adapt for any technical reasons

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:18,140
and if the project passes her first

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:21,110
sniff test she she needs to understand

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,080
the project better like she needs to see

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:27,380
whether it's healthy and well-maintained

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:31,190
she does this by checking github stats

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:33,650
but like how many starts and downloads

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:37,100
that have like how recent the releases

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:39,980
commits or how many issues are being

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,990
created versus resolved and she does

00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,780
quick overview of documentation whether

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:48,110
like they exist in case she needs them

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,660
and only once she is sure that the

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,900
project is healthy and the community as

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,770
active Parker starts digging into the

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,470
code itself

00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:59,870
she needs to create a map of the code in

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,020
its pieces and figure out if it's a good

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,210
fit for her use case and she wants help

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,670
a help getting up and running really

00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,890
fast by doing quick start looking at

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,950
tutorials and reading the documentation

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:15,830
and at this stage it's very important

00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:17,810
for your resources like documentation

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:21,380
and tutorials to be out there very

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:23,120
accessible findable understandable for

00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:28,150
her to get on board quickly to the

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,710
project but also before adopting any

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,750
open source software she wants to make

00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,480
sure that there won't be any legal

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:38,270
complications so she searches for the

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,900
dogs that she can let's say pass on to

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:47,720
her legal team for assessment or some

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:50,440
yeah and after that like after she is

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,500
able to answer all of these questions

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,260
she's ready to adopt the technology she

00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,040
starts using it and she is very excited

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:05,030
about it because it's free and it gets

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:09,010
her job done and yeah yes she's having

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:12,650
fun and she keeps using the technology

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,100
she might run into a problem like it can

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,870
be a bug or it can be any other

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,459
implementation issues and then she

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,819
starts searching the docs

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:25,439
for specific answers and she goes to

00:13:23,819 --> 00:13:27,809
other support channels like Stack

00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:31,199
Overflow to find the answer and after

00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:34,019
doing quite a bit of research she finds

00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:37,470
a solution and she's excited about it

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,120
like she has an idea how to fix it let's

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,819
see she can write two lines of

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,730
documentation that would help all other

00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:47,009
users in the future not to run into the

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,350
same problem over and over again and

00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:53,550
that's a trigger for her to contribute

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:55,800
back at this stage parker is adapting

00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:00,290
the project she's making it better with

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,850
just two lines of documentation and

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,680
she's happy about it because she knows

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,910
that it would be so helpful and

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,920
everybody else would benefit from it and

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,740
it would save a lot of time for future

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,100
users not to run into the same problem

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,350
or solve the same problem very quickly

00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,240
but she has never created PR as we

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,209
mentioned before right she never used

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,029
github so she needs that's a barrier for

00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:29,490
her and she needs to figure out how it's

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:33,300
done and it takes a lot of time and

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,970
let's imagine she goes to her boss and

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,980
she says hey I want to work on this and

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,579
they say like hey we're not paying for

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,829
you to work on free software and that's

00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:46,709
another like per ear like she doesn't

00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:50,490
have time but then there are other

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:53,610
questions that start kicking in what if

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,889
my idea isn't good enough what if people

00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:59,249
laugh at me what if they call me stupid

00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:02,639
and like this rip apart my suggestion

00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:06,980
and partner might may even go to the dev

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,389
list and user list to check how similar

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,589
contributions were handled in the past

00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:16,290
if there were some toxic behaviors or if

00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:19,230
documentation contributions never got

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,209
the attention from reviewers or if other

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,779
non code contributions they never got

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:26,910
recognized in the community she might

00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:29,579
have second thoughts of contributing

00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:33,269
back right because the act of

00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:34,110
contributing is very vulnerable it

00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:37,620
exposed

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:42,330
and it stressful and it requires a lot

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:44,670
of courage and effort and time so and if

00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:49,140
Parker decides not to contribute back to

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:51,750
the project everyone loses first Parker

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,910
loses a chance to become a member of an

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,300
awesome open-source community and grow

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,790
there and become a leader the project

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,300
was is because she never submits her

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,850
change and of course even her employer

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,589
loses because they was the chance of

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,510
telling everyone else and their

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,910
customers that they're very active in

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,860
the open-source communities and it's a

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,120
very sad story if she doesn't contribute

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,519
back so how can we change it how can we

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,829
ensure that she contributes and feel

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,410
safe in the community Joana

00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:28,200
that is actually a great question and

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,899
Parker's example is a great example on

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,350
how we can miss out on the opportunity

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:37,769
of having a new contributor providing

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,990
new contributions to our projects so how

00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:42,510
can we attract and retain these

00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,029
contributors that is the main question I

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,000
may have a few answers but I would love

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:50,480
to hear from your perspectives after

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,149
this session and one of them is to

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,399
recognize early no contribution is too

00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:59,270
small and I'm going to say it again

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,490
because it is so critically important no

00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:04,890
contribution is too small and recognized

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,600
early because the chances of having your

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,550
contributors sticking around and

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,490
continuing improving your project over

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,010
time are higher when you recognize them

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:18,110
early in their open-source journey but

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:20,640
also over time so therefore reward

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,579
consistently and over time people feel

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,380
more engaged more motivated and they

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:29,010
will stick around with your project and

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,230
therefore also by doing these two steps

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,870
you'll be able to build an empowered

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,820
network of like-minded individuals who

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,620
will continue supporting each other

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,870
throughout their open-source journey

00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,179
this journey sometimes can be very

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,660
lonely but by being together we are

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:47,830
stronger together as well so what are

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,919
the outcomes that we can

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,070
get by having disempowered networks and

00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,409
communities there are primarily two

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,419
outcomes that I believe that we can gain

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:01,390
from supporting our communities

00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:03,700
the first one is development agility our

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,830
projects become more agile more

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,529
effective and every and therefore

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,230
everybody wins and that goes in line

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:13,570
with ecosystem growth when one wins we

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,210
all win in open source and therefore

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,460
companies also benefit by having these

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,740
diverse empowered networks of

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,240
communities

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,190
well if you takeaways that I would like

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,399
you to take from this presentation today

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:31,269
and the first one is nurture your

00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:34,000
community care for your people diversity

00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:36,190
of experiences and perspectives is so

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,950
important in open source and that's what

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:41,350
make our project stronger non-code

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,570
contributions they add value to our

00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:45,970
projects in so many ways like we

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,940
mentioned with these examples before so

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:51,549
therefore we must create and I challenge

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,340
you to create the infrastructure and the

00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:56,260
tools and support systems to recognize

00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,260
and identify these known called

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,960
contributions because again no

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,779
contribution is too small recognize

00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:07,750
early reward consistently and build

00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,659
empowered networks thank you so much for

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,549
being with us today and we really

00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:15,399
appreciate your time and we would like

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:24,100
to open for questions thank you thank

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:26,559
you and if you don't have any questions

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,409
we will also now work around the room

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,750
while you all have lunch and I hope that

00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:36,669
you continue enjoying the session we

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:40,990
happen to have one in fact yes yes hello

00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:44,260
hello yes perfectly so I I just wanted

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:47,070
to thank everyone here I am part of the

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:51,880
diversity scholarship program yeah

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:54,909
welcome I this is my first time at this

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,779
conference and I have never met a more

00:19:54,909 --> 00:20:00,130
welcoming smart group of people who are

00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,480
willing to share their know

00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:06,280
and as somebody who is yeah I have a

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,049
background in technology but I've always

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,580
been afraid to learn to code and I think

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:14,380
that the culture that's being created

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,740
here is really really important for that

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,049
because as a patient advocate I know

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,870
that we need to like kind of spread that

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:25,870
that knowledge to other communities who

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,580
don't have it so I just wanted to give a

00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:30,120
shout out to everybody here and like you

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,890
guys are doing a great job oh thank you

00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,870
absolutely you so much thank you so much

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,730
for your comment I think that it's safe

00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,190
to say that both Hamel and I absolutely

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,010
agree with that we also have very

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,080
different education and cultural

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,720
backgrounds and it's fantastic to see

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,940
that in a safe space we can all learn

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,400
and grow together and share our opinions

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,710
and experiences so thank you so much for

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,500
organizing such a beautiful conference

00:20:53,710 --> 00:21:02,350
thank you thank you it was pleasure to

00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:05,740
be here yeah there we go oh I'm sorry

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:10,000
it's the light is hitting my face I can

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:12,130
see it's fine so I run community at my

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,260
company and that includes both like

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,419
discussion forums but also Co

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,220
contributions and I'm trying to get more

00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:21,789
contributions from people in other

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:26,080
countries besides the US and also

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:28,090
hopefully way more women and one of the

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,150
things that I find myself running into

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,890
is that in a lot of communities there's

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:37,270
a culture where there's almost a sense

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:39,159
of pride in in pulling ideas apart to

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,070
the extreme so when you made the comment

00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:45,520
about being torn down or feeling really

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:48,159
vulnerable it can be difficult to

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,130
dismantle that culture when that's one

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,559
of the organizing principles that people

00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:56,860
derive status from and take pride in and

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,720
I'm wondering if there if there have

00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:01,510
been things that emerged in your

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,150
research on the user journey with

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,799
options to replace that like if you take

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,750
away a post from a building you have to

00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,690
put something else in to hold it up

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,480
so what are some ways to reinforce that

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,649
sense of community that don't involve

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,200
being elitist and don't involve you know

00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:22,299
snark and is there anything that you

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,789
found that people respond to in its

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:29,669
place that you're kind of able to

00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:33,190
recommend I mean yeah that's a that's a

00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:34,960
question that we get quite often and

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:39,789
it's very hard and complicated process

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:43,360
and we didn't go that far of how they

00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:46,480
like were able to remove those people

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,570
with toxic behaviors and and things like

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,059
that but from the experience I can tell

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:56,529
that because I I contribute to Apache

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:59,139
project they all they have very clear

00:22:56,529 --> 00:23:02,799
like code of conduct and every time

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:06,210
someone is behaving and offending

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:10,149
someone else there's always someone who

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:15,130
comes out and says well you're doing the

00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:19,440
wrong thing and you need to have leaders

00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:22,269
like that to come and yes enforce those

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,029
good actions and behaviors in the

00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:27,820
community and if it's unfortunate if

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:30,340
everyone like the people who have the

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,049
voice are all like that it's absolutely

00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,649
unfortunate and I don't think those kind

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:38,679
of projects can survive long term but I

00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:41,559
really yeah I really recommend for any

00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:45,279
project to have very clear code of

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:47,679
conduct and they're like some of them

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:51,070
they're already out there you can always

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,480
adapt them and to be applicable to a

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,899
project I hope that answers your

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,690
questions but yeah we can talk more once

00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm there absolutely

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,039
but that was a great answer by having a

00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:05,350
code of conduct we are all responsible

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,570
for the health and the culture and

00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,149
environment of our community soundly so

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,860
it comes down to what kind of culture do

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,899
we want to promote and support in our

00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,269
communities and by having and

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:19,330
reinforcing a code of conduct and that

00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:21,460
we can all feel comfortable with and and

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,529
that we are building a safe space we all

00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,659
gain by that so really trying to

00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:27,220
understand what are the the difference

00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:29,409
is recognizing what

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,270
the known code contributions and also

00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:33,640
reinforcing a code of conduct that could

00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:37,390
be and definitely some of the ways to go

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:41,049
yeah so I want to be mindful of time I

00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,940
think we're way over time I have

00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:45,669
something very quick to say just to add

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,070
I wanted to make sure everyone noticed

00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:51,159
on their table that there are posters

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,200
and stickers and postcards for I am

00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,870
remarkable and if you're not familiar

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,850
with I am remarkable definitely check it

00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,740
out and take the stickers do whatever

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:03,280
you want with them but this is another

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:06,880
way to help people from any background

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,460
any gendered you know whatever you want

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,990
to become more confident in speaking up

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,789
for yourself and talking about your

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,250
accomplishments so as you're doing

00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:17,950
coding as you're doing anything in your

00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:20,110
professional life or your personal life

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:22,179
you can take these skills and and speak

00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:24,309
with more confidence and tell people

00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:26,559
what you've accomplished so check out

community because it's something that

00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,520
will really drive those conversations in

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,580
