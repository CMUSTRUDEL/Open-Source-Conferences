	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,980
how would you describe the evolution of

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,140
application architecture yes so the

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,410
application architecture started with

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,860
more monolithic approach and then it

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,220
moved to layers with the development of

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,109
different technologies as well as

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:21,810
different application development styles

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,970
so it went from two-tier to three-tier

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,410
and with the service service oriented

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,140
architecture it went for a layered

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,840
architecture and with the micro services

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,850
coming into the picture moving to more

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,410
segmented or decentralized architecture

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,399
that's what I see the evolution of the

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,680
application architecture happened during

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,450
last two decades what do you think is

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,940
driving the shift to decentralize

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,969
architectures and the enterprise yeah so

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,059
a bunch of reasons mainly the micro

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,489
services and micro service architecture

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,289
that's one and number two is the

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,440
deployments are moving more into

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,510
containers and container based

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,910
infrastructure so those two are leading

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,479
from the technology side and with the

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,090
people or the the culture side people

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,479
are moving to more agile approach and

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,369
with that you get different teams small

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,960
teams operate individually so that the

00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,909
decentralized architecture helps at the

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,220
development deployment and the

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,450
maintenance of these applications so

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,740
that's where the decentralized

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,110
architecture coming into the picture

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,170
with all these technology processes and

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,329
people related aspects in the context of

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,210
decentralized architectures is a layered

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,659
architecture still a valid pattern yes I

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,909
would say it's I liked 80/20 still 80%

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,399
of the enterprises dealing with the

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,649
layered architecture and we purchased

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,390
and build a lot of systems during last

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,820
two decades and still they are in

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,220
delayed architecture so we can't do

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,159
overnight shift to a decentralized

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,829
architecture as well as it required the

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,860
correct technology correct skill set so

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,689
I believe still the layered architecture

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,020
it's a valid architecture pattern and

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,360
benefiting a lot of organizations can

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,510
organization use a mix of decentralized

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,519
and centralized architectures yes as I

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,879
said again inside the enterprise it's

00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,099
80/20 split as well so the Greenfield

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,680
applications can move into more decently

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,840
centralized architecture and then the

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,030
existing application can stay and

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,239
improve in the layered architecture and

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,790
I think the API sees abs are playing a

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,140
massive role here by connecting the

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,390
layered architecture and the

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,730
decentralized architecture connecting

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,440
the greenfield and the brown field how

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,239
do you see emerging architecture

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,610
patterns evolving and what do you expect

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,950
to see in the near future so I think

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,220
people will move more and more into the

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,900
decentralized architecture the lot of

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,690
changes happen with the technology

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,230
improvement as well as the concepts like

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,569
a DZ full stack developer came into the

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,430
picture that a single person running

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,700
multiple rows within the same

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,250
application development team so

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:12,269
decentralization helps them to be

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,049
productive and then deliver applications

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:17,639
in the rapid way based on the business

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:19,859
movements as well as business

00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:22,350
requirement changes so that's what I see

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,209
that will happen in near future and we

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,819
have everything appropriate for a

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,220
structure platforms as well as new

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,410
architecture patterns introduced to

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,150
support that oh great thank you very

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,569
much for talking with me today thank you

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,569
