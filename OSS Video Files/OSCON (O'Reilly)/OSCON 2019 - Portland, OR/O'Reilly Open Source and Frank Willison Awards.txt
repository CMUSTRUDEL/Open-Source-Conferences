	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,069
so we are gonna do something that we

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,859
usually do at this time which is the Oz

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,410
con open source Awards so if you're here

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,820
last year you remember that we changed

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,639
it up a little bit and we wanted to

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,289
honor projects over individuals because

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,570
products are made up of lots of

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,100
individuals and so we've continued with

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,439
that this year and it also it is voted

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,600
by you the conference attendee or I

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,990
suppose also if you're not here so

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,269
anyway so the first there's three the

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,460
first one is the most impact award it's

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,250
a significant impact on how software is

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,750
built breakout project of the year which

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,040
is a project that really became a

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,930
tipping point and people stopped

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,670
experimenting and started really using

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,850
it and then lifetime achievement award

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,200
which I feel like speaks for itself so

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,120
Kelsey take it away awesome we're gonna

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,649
start with the most impact award the

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,860
goal of this is a project that makes a

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,870
big impact on our entire industry so if

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,059
you have ever set up a website how many

00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,390
people have done this hopefully with the

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:04,729
HTTP certificate you can keep your hand

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:09,080
up if your HTTP certificate is expired

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,080
there's a whole chat for people like you

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,710
the let's encrypt project kind of

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,390
represents how we can automate this in a

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,400
way with open source software is the

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,439
first open source project that offers

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,570
managed service with that let's give a

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,670
warm one little pause to let's encrypt

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,939
and Sarah and Julian to accept their

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,939
award

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,360

[Music]

00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,690
[Applause]

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,200
all right thank you don't mind our

00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,240
open-source award selfies just go by the

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,550
next award goes to the breakout project

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,850
of the year now how many of you have

00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:56,630
written Java that's a lot of pain and

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,860
sorrow in the audience

00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:01,560
Collins attempt to make this better has

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,050
been a huge success a Martinson tax on

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,210
top of the JVM making it much easier to

00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,860
build robust applications and even did a

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,200
great job in improving the experience

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,310
for mobile with that wouldn't give a big

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,230
round of welcome for the breakout

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:31,709
project of the year and now it's Roman

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:35,310
to accept the reward alright so the next

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:38,120
award takes a lifetime to earn if you've

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,680
ever used a database of good database

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,630
you'll be very familiar with the

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,370
Postgres database I mean people have

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,370
experience with Postgres make some noise

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,519
over its lifetime

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,590
Postgres has become the default

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,200
open-source database for a lot of people

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,060
even in the commercial sense with that I

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,130
think we have half of the Postgres team

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,050
here to accept the award let's give a

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,130
big round of welcome for Marc Bruce and

thank you and so we have one more award

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,120
last but not least it's an award that

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,550
we've been giving out for a long time

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,610
it's something that the Python Software

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,810
Foundation and O'Reilly worked together

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,450
to give out each year at OSCON

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,410
it's named the Frank Willis an award and

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,670
that is named after an editor that

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,590
worked at O'Reilly a long time ago who

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,450
was like pythons gonna be a big deal and

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:49,230
apparently everyone was like come on and

00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:52,020
so turns out he was right so we like to

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,040
remember him this way each year so this

00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:58,020
year for contributions to Jupiter and

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,570
being a core developer for Python being

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:03,600
a part of the steering committee I'd

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,920
like to have Carole willing join me up

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,920
