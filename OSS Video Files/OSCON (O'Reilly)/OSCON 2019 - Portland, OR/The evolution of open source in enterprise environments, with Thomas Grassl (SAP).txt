	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,009
how do you see open-source evolving and

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:07,470
enterprise environments yeah open source

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,750
really did a big big step forward over

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,929
the last 5-10 years in the enterprise as

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,480
well like most of the companies I guess

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,760
ap we're building on open source open

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,510
source is in the strategy for our

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,670
products but it's also one thing which

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,980
we take very serious it's how we

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,710
contribute into the projects the

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,399
selection of the projects and also like

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,620
the customers are asking much more about

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,680
like to us like what open source

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,379
projects are using how you maintain this

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,230
so there's much more understanding from

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,070
the enterprise size site around open

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,230
source happening and for ICP I think

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,300
it's the key thing is for us to be close

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,520
to involved in in all these projects to

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,789
move them forward mostly a long

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,539
enterprise features functionality so

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,699
this goes into scaling robustness

00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,920
security because these are the key

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,990
things to run these projects or

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,229
components of these projects within the

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,479
bigger software and so what you were

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,430
talking about just a moment ago s AP has

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,479
gotten more involved in open source can

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,259
you talk a little bit about how that

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,009
came about

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,290
yeah I think it's one of the big secrets

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:26,100
about how much SCP is actually involved

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:29,610
in open source we started about 15 years

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,790
back first Eclipse Eclipse IDE that was

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,960
one of the big things but and also open

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:40,020
JDK Java so there's a lot of projects

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,409
ACP has been actively involved in

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:47,040
contributing over the years I think for

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,960
us the bigger step was like not only

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,360
like to be involved but I'd also talk

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,970
more about it built these connections to

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,000
work with the community be here at OSCON

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,729
talk with the other contributors get

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,649
them together join the Foundation's work

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:05,189
with the foundation so it became like

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:08,190
more of a strategic movement inside sapa

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,319
about open source and I think that's

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,720
also something where we are looking like

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,930
two

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,510
the community out there was like

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,670
contributing projects like the CLA

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,770
assistan it's contributing licensure

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,510
system which we contribute about four

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,260
years back to a community now it's like

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,900
taking on a big big adoption and that's

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,910
also great to see and we don't want to

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,710
hide behind this that we're not not

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,470
present in the market so really like

00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,000
work with the people and also show them

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,070
like yeah like these are the things what

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,260
ICP puts out these are the things where

00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,570
ICP is collaborating on in these

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,690
projects where we have highly active and

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,290
make this present for the open source

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,270
community

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,890
all right and can you share some of the

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,290
specific projects you're working on that

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,990
yeah so this there's a long long list of

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,830
projects a few like to highlight which

00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:03,720
we just really released now just before

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:07,450
Ã¶zkan was open the ui5 web components

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,400
uf5 web components is building on the

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,360
the web component framework and the

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:18,340
standards in the browsers now we had a

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,489
similar area where we had components for

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,370
web in our enterprise environment it was

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,840
called open er5 now we took it into the

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,110
web component standards

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,230
there's about 25 components available

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,880
but these are also very robust

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,770
Enterprise featured components so they

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,820
can do different languages they can do

00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:43,150
Japanese they can do like left to right

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:46,269
and right to left the languages they can

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:49,750
do the security accessibility very

00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:51,880
important features and we took it out

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,800
now and instead of okay let's make it

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,290
available as open source to the broader

00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,690
community what we're looking forward is

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,250
really like feedback not only from the

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,370
enterprise market but definitely also

00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,310
from the broader web builders and web

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,950
developers to see how we can bring these

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,280
open-source projects forward other

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,930
projects in Cloud Foundry kubernetes

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,470
that's where we are definitely looking

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,359
how do we get these these areas closer

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,190
together how can we support you because

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,300
we're building our products on cloud

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:25,669
foundry and kubernetes so there

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,389
lot of like deep involvement in these

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:32,360
projects from sapa going on how would

00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:34,370
you describe the developer culture at sa

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,979
p and can you share maybe some best

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:41,030
practices for keeping a culture healthy

00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:44,120
yeah i think that's it's a new topic we

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,280
also have here talk at OSCON about and

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,860
develop the cultures is more focusing

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,620
first on like an engineering culture

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,319
what it means but there's a lot of like

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:58,129
overlaps or ties into an open source

00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,469
project culture etc so similar like

00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:02,180
every company probably or half engineers

00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:04,430
to have a certain culture it's not only

00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,949
like formed over time and also

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,389
historically but it's also something

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,490
that's specially like for bigger

00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:13,940
companies like ICP where we are

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,710
investing two on the one hand have a

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,919
good understanding on what is our

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:22,250
culture does the engineers buy into this

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,690
culture or are they forming the culture

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,150
that culture is something you need to

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,669
enable from the top but that it needs to

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,069
be built from the grassroots from from

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,380
the engineers and so that's that's a

00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,690
very important topic of course if you

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,159
have a bigger engineering force how do

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,500
we build this up but there's definitely

00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:41,569
a lot of learnings for the open source

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,389
communities like what is your culture

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:47,419
like for your project like and and who

00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:50,810
are the leads like how do you understand

00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,270
your culture are you making feedback

00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,279
surveys are you listening to the surveys

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,080
of what what you contributors for

00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,840
example in an open source project and

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,270
just do there's like similar things what

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,849
we're doing in Sapa with culture you

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,699
know like from us it's an open project

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:10,400
what we are driving so we also want to

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,770
look for the market to work with other

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,659
companies other partners and any

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,669
developer out there to have a more

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,430
ongoing discussion what is an

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:21,110
engineering culture how should you form

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,740
such a culture like how can you

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,789
collaborate in this and drive it forward

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,659
thank you very much for talking with me

00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,659
