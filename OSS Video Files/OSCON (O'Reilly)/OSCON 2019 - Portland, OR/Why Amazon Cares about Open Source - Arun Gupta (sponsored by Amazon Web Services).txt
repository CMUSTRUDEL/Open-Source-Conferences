	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,440
my name is Aaron Gupta I work in the

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,480
open source team at Amazon open source

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,580
is hot and as of this morning literally

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,260
on fire I'm glad we are sitting in the

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,570
hall

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,219
Amazon has been contributing committing

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,660
collaborating in the open source for

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,060
many years and today I'm here to tell

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,600
you about why Amazon cares about open

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,730
source at Amazon we are customer

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,460
obsessed you know 90 to 95 percent of

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,960
our roadmap is driven by customers we

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,400
don't look at a technology that this is

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,990
a cool technology and let's build a

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,750
service around it

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,850
we customers tell us what are the

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,860
services that matter to them and they

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,110
want to run at scale and that's the kind

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,360
of reason we look at on take a service

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,000
and take a open source project and build

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,430
a service around it our customers love

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,010
open source and they want us to help

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,989
them innovate on top of them that is

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,480
what drives our contribution to open

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,120
source at times we contribute to

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,129
projects like Linux and kubernetes that

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,469
is already existing because our

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,290
customers want us to help them at other

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,750
times we contribute our own projects

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,390
things like apache MX net or firecracker

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,250
as Kelsey was talking about and then

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,990
that other times we are also looking at

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,640
projects that are created by the

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,350
customer something like Netflix

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,110
spinnaker and adding our own

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,729
integrations to those projects at all of

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,040
these venues essentially we are helping

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,659
customers to be more innovative and do

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,790
the heavy lifting for them now a healthy

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,829
community is super important and we

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,840
invest in multiple ways which I'll talk

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,869
about in a second on how to make sure

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,479
that those communities stay healthy and

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:41,850
however you're investing in those it's

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,439
also important for us to make sure that

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,880
we get a lot of eyeballs which is a

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,189
typical benefit of an open source

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,880
community so we have released software

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,649
like s to N which is our Apache licensed

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,630
TLS implementation and we got a lot more

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,329
eyeballs and a much better quality on

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,060
top of that and last but not the least a

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,210
lot of open source contributions from

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,979
Amazon come from the fact that

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,810
maintaining an internal fork or a branch

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,789
you know leads to a technical debt and

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,869
it's a maintenance nightmare so we want

00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,810
to make sure there is a upstream

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,830
compatibility over there these are some

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,320
of the example project

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,210
that we contribute to let me talk about

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,740
a couple that I know we care about

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,600
so first is say OpenJDK in 2016 we

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,520
realize we cannot rely upon a binary

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:32,100
distribution of Java we we are a huge

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,200
Java shop and as we were building we

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,870
started checking out the open JDK source

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,600
code and building our own binary and

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,070
giving that to all of our services

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,610
because thousands of micro services

00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:47,270
running on top of open JDK now as we

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,500
were running it we realize now there are

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,420
operational fixes there are performance

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,520
improvements that we can do and we can

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,100
do releases lot more frequently for our

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,680
team now we did that for a couple of

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,650
years and then we treat our internal and

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,840
external customers about the same so

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,300
again coming from a customer obsession

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,820
angle customers tell us that hey we need

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,850
something which is a no-cost long-term

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,010
supported binary so we were contributing

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:16,560
these all to upstream one of the core

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,239
tenets of Amazon careto which we

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,760
launched last year is upstream

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,709
compatibility same reasons we don't want

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,600
to maintain a fork we want to make sure

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,519
there are no maintenance nightmares over

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,830
the long period of time so we continue

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,600
collaborating and putting all our fixes

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,720
in open JDK so it was a fairly

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,880
straightforward Amazon careto is now a

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,510
no-cost long-term supported distribution

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,340
of open JDK under the project that I

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,820
want to talk about is kubernetes and HCD

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,100
now according to the latest CN CF survey

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,820
50% of cuban air is more than 50%

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,370
actually runs on top of AWS customers

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,410
tell us is not easy to run kubernetes or

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,989
manage the cluster or at least for them

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,280
is undifferentiated heavy lifting that's

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,760
exactly where we said okay we're gonna

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,010
create Amazon eks and this is a fully

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,810
managed control plane and now you can

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:11,430
bring your kubernetes workloads very

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,140
easily on AWS let's talk about the ways

00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,209
which we interact in the community and

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,820
we invest in them we are part of the

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,739
Linux Foundation over two years ago we

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,660
join just about two years ago actually

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,640
we joined a cloud native computing

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,140
Foundation as a Platinum Member again

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,550
customers tell us because that's where

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,419
all the interesting discussions are

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,789
happening

00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,860
so be there and listen to us we upped

00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:33,780
our level of Apache foundation so all of

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,569
these foundations are the venues where

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,550
our customers want us to be present this

00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,289
is the third year in a row that we are a

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,180
top-tier sponsor for askon so very

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:43,949
excited about that and then we are also

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,779
looking at other conferences which are

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,060
open source related where we could be

00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,860
present and talk to our customers

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,529
yet another venue where we can talk to

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,689
them we also created open sourced or

00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:56,099
amazon.com which is a one source landing

00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:59,009
page where you can learn everything

00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:02,250
around open source we also have a open

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,379
source blog and the thing that I'm most

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,319
excited about over there is how more

00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:10,439
than 20% of contributions to that blog

00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,029
are coming from customers like you or

00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,279
developers like you so if you are

00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:16,740
building anything open source and cool

00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,659
on AWS I would love to see your

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,819
contributions over there you want to

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,210
talk to us we of course have social

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,669
media handles so AWS open so here are

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,589
the main references for you you want to

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:30,779
learn about what is Amazon doing in open

00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:33,659
source go to open source or amazon.com

00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,819
you wanna talk to us talk to us at AWS

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:38,250
open follow that handle and you wanna

00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:39,539
write a document or an article or

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,939
something cool that you're doing with

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,469
your pen source let me know and my

00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,400
twitter handle is on my back and take a
