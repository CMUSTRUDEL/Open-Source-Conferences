Title: The War for the Soul of Open Source - Adam Jacob (Chef)
Publication date: 2019-07-18
Playlist: OSCON 2019 - Portland, OR
Description: 
	What is the emotional, intellectual, artistic heart of the free and open source software movement? As open source reigns ascendent as the dominant development paradigm in the world, we have lost touch with what makes it great. Drawing on 13 years spent building the Chef community, and by research into what makes for Sustainable Free and Open Source Communities, Adam Jacob takes a deep dive into the soul of open sourceâ€”and presents a way forward that reconnects us to what made it great in the first place.

so then I find myself kind of alone and

00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,200
thinking about alright and finally

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,670
meaning in business I couldn't find any

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,170
meaning that I could register within the

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,170
Free Software Foundation I couldn't find

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,199
it in the OSI what's left and the truth

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:19,320
is what's left is people what's left is

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,420
you guys is this weird mess of all these

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,220
individuals with all this stuff that you

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,840
want and all these things that you need

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,849
and all these different senses of

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,189
meaning and purpose and vision that

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,289
somehow improbably come together to

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,030
solve problems in your own lives and

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,750
each of us are a weird different shape

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,360
struggling to find our path and yet

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,730
open-source gives us this ability to

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,950
gather together around this resource

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,480
that we turn from being scarce when we

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,910
copyright our software we keep it from

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,110
each other to being infinite I just give

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,309
it to you and I'm like I don't know what

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,050
you want in your life I don't know what

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,059
you need but I know that you could take

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,920
it and I know that you taking it doesn't

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,690
hurt me at all because it's essentially

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,600
infinite it's just ones and zeroes and

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,370
and honestly you can just keep doing it

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,530
as long as you have power and compute

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,360
cycles build whatever life you need to

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,880
build do whatever the thing is you need

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,030
to do and that's amazing and so at our

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,890
best we actually treat the communities

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,750
around our software like a watershed

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,310
where all of us are stewards where we

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,170
come together to help each other to take

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,720
what we need from this infinite pool and

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,580
to build the life that we want and to

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,070
stay together to work together to solve

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,049
our problems and build what we need so

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,390
that we can be more resilient and strong

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,729
and fulfilled regardless of the label of

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,079
whether you're open-source or not and I

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,880
think that's the true soul of

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,189
open-source it's all of you with

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,170
different meanings but with some kind of

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,970
overlapping sense of shared values and

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,189
shared purpose and I don't think anybody

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,930
can actually define it for you and so I

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,790
would challenge you to look at your own

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,110
desires look at your own needs look at

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,780
the things that you want in your own

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,180
life and then go out and find or build

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,189
and steward communities with the other

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,869
people who share those values and who

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,969
will embrace your purpose and who wants

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,890
you to be that person and to sustain

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,490
each other because that is the true soul

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,490
of open source

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,709
