Publication date: 2019-07-18
Playlist: OSCON 2019 - Portland, OR
Description: 
	What is the emotional, intellectual, artistic heart of the free and open source software movement? As open source reigns ascendent as the dominant development paradigm in the world, we have lost touch with what makes it great. Drawing on 13 years spent building the Chef community, and by research into what makes for Sustainable Free and Open Source Communities, Adam Jacob takes a deep dive into the soul of open sourceâ€”and presents a way forward that reconnects us to what made it great in the first place.
