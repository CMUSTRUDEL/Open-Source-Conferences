hi everyone so my name is Brad topal I'm

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,600
an IBM distinguished engineer of open

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,309
technology and developer advocacy and

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm here to talk to you about code and

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,130
response which is an initiative that IBM

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,810
is leading to help use leverage open

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,369
source to mitigate natural disasters but

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,250
before we get into that let me first

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,529
talk about ibm's rich history of

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,599
contributing to open source now I've

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:33,360
been at IBM 21 years I lived this

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,130
open-source history so I'm not going to

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,890
talk to the speaker notes with the

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,110
marketing approved sanitized talk I'm

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,680
gonna give you the vh1 behind the music

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,200
version of this history let me take you

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,410
all back to 1999 this is my first year

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,719
at IBM we had our own proprietary web

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,660
server it was called the Lotus Go web

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,590
server and let me be gentle it was

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,170
terrible it was proprietary it had

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,350
limited functionality and it probably

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,020
had about one percent market share and I

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,299
was in the room when they announced that

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,430
we were gonna stop using the Lotus code

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,680
web server and we were gonna put all our

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,020
effort behind this new open-source web

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,299
server called Apache and we were gonna

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,750
bring in a team of our best developers

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,670
to contribute to Apache ad enterprise

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,200
security features and when they

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,000
announced that in the room everybody

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,790
cheered we knew it was the right

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,520
decision so if we fast forward past that

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,020
a little bit similar story we had a

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,180
great integrated development environment

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,110
called Eclipse 40 million dollars worth

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,400
of development we gave it away now some

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,070
people might have found that shocking

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,229
but we made it open-source and started a

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,380
foundation but it was the right thing to

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,299
do if you look at how eclipse has grown

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,460
in the ecosystem around it it's been

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,520
amazing the pluggable tools the

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,189
extensibility and so moving forward from

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,759
that we've been huge contributors to

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,770
OpenStack cloud foundry kubernetes I

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,110
personally have had the honor of leading

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,330
large teams and being a contributor

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,849
myself to both OpenStack and kubernetes

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,470
so quick shout-out to my friends and

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,660
both those communities Keystone

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,210
team and the kubernetes dock team and

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,740
conforms team working in open source for

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:24,720
the past seven years of IBM has been the

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,910
best part of my 21-year career so IBM's

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,390
also had a quick history a long history

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,220
of helping solve society's problems one

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,410
of one of the most notable were coming

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,710
up on the fiftieth anniversary is the

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,470
moon landing you may not know this but

00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:43,470
alongside the nasa engineers we had

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,760
4,000 IBM errs helping to land the lunar

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,800
module on the moon

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,080
those were IBM systems that were

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,580
responsible for that and I'm a little

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,410
pressed for time so I won't cover the

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,600
other ones but we've had a great history

00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,700
of helping to solve society's greatest

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,740
problems and now we're onto our new

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,660
initiative and this is the biggest one

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:07,020
we've tackled so far natural disasters

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:11,280
affect 2.5 billion people every year

00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:14,610
with property loss human loss human

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,100
suffering and we cannot prevent natural

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,739
disasters but we can come up with better

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,870
solutions to prepare for them and better

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,090
solutions for how we respond to them and

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,890
so this is our code and response

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:30,810
initiative that we started last year so

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,130
what did we do well we first said we've

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,590
got all these great building blocks at

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,060
IBM we have the weather company that's

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,209
an IBM company so we have all the

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,030
weather forecasting api's alert api's we

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,590
have AI we have Internet of thing

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,049
technology all these great building

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,670
blocks and everything you know if we

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:50,459
could just go engage the open source

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:54,720
community and get people involved to

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,250
participate in this effort and so how

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,650
could we do this what would get people

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,510
excited everybody's so busy but they all

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,799
want to help so we could have given way

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,660
to shirts we could have given way

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,180
hoodies but what we said is we're going

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,100
to have a programming competition get

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,110
about four four of your your favorite

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,860
friends to build a team and we're going

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:17,640
to give a $200,000 cash prize that was

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,100
quite a nudge so as you might expect we

00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,660
did get a little bit of participation

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,390
last year we had over a hundred thousand

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,830
developers participate over 2,500

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:28,830
applications built

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,900
people from over 150 Six Nations

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,060
participated we did this jointly with

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,030
the United Nations and Clinton Global

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,280
Initiative really really cool and let me

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,069
show you the winner from last year which

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,409
was project owl so basically what

00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:46,210
project now was is when there's a

00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,250
natural disaster like a hurricane all

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,960
the cell phones stop working all the

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,020
communication towers get blown out and

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,720
and and don't work and so the idea that

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,919
the winner came up with project owl was

00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,500
we're gonna have these little plastic

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:01,030
things called ducks and over the

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,639
disaster area we're gonna spread them

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,430
all around and those ducks are gonna

00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,770
form an ad hoc Wi-Fi network and now

00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:12,039
people can connect to that ad-hoc Wi-Fi

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,789
network and be able to say things like I

00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,949
need food I need water I need help so

00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:20,139
the Wi-Fi duct network with their

00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:24,250
incident management system all built on

00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:26,020
open source and IBM technologies this

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,490
was the winner now the cool part of

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,949
koden response is we don't just stop

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,719
with hey you want a competition we have

00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:34,389
a five year or 30 million dollar

00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:36,009
initiative to actually deploy these

00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:37,539
things out in the field and so this year

00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:40,569
we're actually doing large-scale tests

00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:42,550
in Puerto Rico with project owl now at

00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:45,880
this point I want to bring out Pedro

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:48,639
Cruz Pedro was our porto rico hackathon

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,020
winner this natural disaster personally

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,300
affected him and he's going to come out

00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,400
and tell you his solution there was a

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,190
hackathon winner for dealing with

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,560
natural disasters so come on out Pedro

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,740
[Music]

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,740
[Applause]

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,160
Thank You Brad so let me just say it's

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:16,780
an honor to be here and talk about my

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:20,630
story so it was September 20th 2017 and

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:24,289
this is my Island this is where I live

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:27,470
it's Puerto Rico and after the hurricane

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,660
we were left without electricity without

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,970
communications for months and we were

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,849
left with the big enormous challenge of

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,970
giving relief to 3.5 million people so

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:41,599
after the hurricane I was left without

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,610
anything my phone didn't work I ventured

00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:46,250
off to look for my family my friends and

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,190
my grandma locally I was able to find

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,860
them however we still had to deal with

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,780
the problem of communications so it took

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,240
multiple months to get everything back

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:03,020
online and we saw a lot of messages like

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,300
this SOS we need water and food these

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,360
messages were written on the ground on

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,150
the roofs of houses and when people saw

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,159
helicopters flying in but didn't receive

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,530
any help that's why people started

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:18,020
writing these messages so at the call

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:21,020
for code Puerto Rico hackathon last year

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,990
I created drone aid and drone aid is a

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,630
software that uses AI object detection

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,300
to be able to look for these messages

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,849
after a natural disaster with drones so

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:34,009
through a open-source we can create

00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:36,259
solutions that are available to the rest

00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,599
of the community and hopefully save

00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:41,419
lives so I encourage all of you today to

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,479
look at the call for code website and if

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:48,009
you have an idea we have time to submit

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,009
your application so thank you

00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:58,800
outstanding personal story so I've just

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,229
got a few minutes left

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,699
but the competition is still going on

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,949
there's still time to submit for this

00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,919
year it is a five-year initiative so you

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:10,020
can get a jump on next year at developer

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,569
not ibm.com color code we have a lot of

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,520
great information on natural disasters

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,889
and great ideas to how you could get

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,039
started and helping you think about what

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,900
solution you want to come up with again

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,400
we have a large number of building

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,610
blocks we have all those weather company

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,949
api's we have Internet of Things we have

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,979
our initial artificial intelligence we

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,449
have machine learning all these

00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,550
wonderful building blocks that are

00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:38,880
available for you to use as you come up

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,699
with your solution with your team and

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,279
again we're back to still having a

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:45,720
$200,000 cash prize and for the ideas

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:47,279
that are really really good it doesn't

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,930
stop there you don't just get your pat

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,060
on the back we're gonna fly around the
