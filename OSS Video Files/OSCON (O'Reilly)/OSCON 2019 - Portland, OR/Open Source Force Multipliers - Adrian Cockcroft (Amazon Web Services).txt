	00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,460
so some better strategies for how to do

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,089
this MongoDB have done a much better job

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,730
here

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,500
they were always as Adam pointed out

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,210
focused on using open source as a

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,679
marketing vehicle rather than the

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,420
contribution vehicle they really have

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,830
very few contributions and it was not

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,050
what they were trying to do but they

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,359
learnt to build and operate a cloud

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,430
service Corp MongoDB Atlas did a good

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
job with that and priced it to be a

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,050
cloud service they weren't sort of they

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,240
figured out that piece of the model they

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,750
then used the cloud marketplace to reach

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,670
a lot of customers within AWS and how's

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,710
this going well over the last six

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,800
quarters they've gone from 11% of their

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,930
revenue and Cloud Atlas to 35% so they

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,850
have basically now you know a lot of

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,570
their income is coming from this service

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,079
and AWS and Microsoft as you have both

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,180
built clone versions of MongoDB which

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,800
are not impacting that growth we're it's

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,510
a big market we've actually we're

00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,100
endorsing that market and we're getting

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,539
more and more so it's if we're basically

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,859
doing this thing where the market just

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,019
gets bigger and bigger as more people

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,270
come in so you don't have to own all of

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,110
the market but if other people come in

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,750
it's a bigger market and then with this

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,520
year reinvent our big conference MongoDB

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,100
is a top-level sponsors like Intel

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,950
VMware MongoDB the highest level you can

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,439
get right they are leveraging all of the

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,299
AWS marketing around reinvent to be

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,659
absolutely in your face with all the

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,820
customers as a key piece of software so

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,590
that's that's a clever move and that

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,610
they're leveraging all of everything

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,710
that AWS does so they're using cloud as

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,380
a force multiplier very effectively and

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,600
by and if you're if you're competing

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,310
with MongoDB you're going like well what

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,170
about us and the customer says well I

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,970
don't I don't see anyone running you as

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,770
a service so are you probably just going

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,049
to go away eventually right what's the

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,000
long-term support model for something

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,520
that no one seems to care about right so

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,060
it's it's an endorsement effectively of

00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,060
that brand

00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,030
