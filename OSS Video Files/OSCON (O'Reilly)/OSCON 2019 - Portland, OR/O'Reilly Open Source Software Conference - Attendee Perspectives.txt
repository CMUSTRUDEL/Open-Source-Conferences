Open source is at the core of the software development. But today, you have to go deeper. You need to know how to implement new technologies like Kubernetes and TensorFlow. You need to work in a cloud environment that isn't always open source-friendly. To know how machine learning can make or break your code. Whether you're looking to understand where software development is headed, or want to dive into the key technologies that you need to build resilient, useful, innovative software, the O'Reilly Open Source Software Conference is where you'll find the answers you need.

[Music]

00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,020
this is my one-stop shop for like

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:09,080
finally got all the new things that are

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,429
out there in the open source world

00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,620
there's so many people here doing so

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,120
many different things and effecting

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,490
technology and our lives in so many

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,199
different ways I think it broadens your

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,990
mind I brought is just scope of what is

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,390
possible this year I'm seeing a lot

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,460
about blockchain a lot about cloud

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,939
native technologies like kubernetes and

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,619
service mesh and if that's something you

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,010
want to learn about this is a great

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,360
place to do it you walk away with real

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,370
knowledge when you leave the courses

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,590
here more of a scope of understanding of

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,450
open source technologies and meet a lot

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,160
of people within that space it's a good

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,200
way to get exposure and learn about new

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,050
technologies I like the diversity of

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,280
talks I think it really makes it nice

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,980
because then you can hit a bunch of

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,489
different topics within one place versus

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,289
you having to go to multiple conference

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:00,180
if you're looking for ways to like bring

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,609
the open-source into a company I think

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,269
that absolutely this is the place to

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,000
come

00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:09,400
you

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,400
