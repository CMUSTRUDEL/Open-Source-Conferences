	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,120
a couple of weeks ago I was at in eighth

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,280
grade graduation and a thirteen year old

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,250
girl took the stage and told her peers

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,380
that were gathered there if we are gonna

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,680
have a future we need to collectively

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,900
act and she used the word if we're

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,750
facing more complicated and

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:26,090
interconnected problems than ever before

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,250
food insecurity climate change food

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,710
social and financial inequality we

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,329
absolutely need the global brain trust

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:38,280
on these problems and we need the

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:40,559
practice and the ethos of open but is it

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,469
going to be enough can we make change of

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,780
the magnitude we need when there are

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,750
millions sitting on the sidelines it's

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,600
time to really examine how far can

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,989
decentralized contribution go can we

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,510
somehow supercharge it so that we're

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,670
getting millions activating millions

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,480
from the sidelines to contribute their

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,369
time and their ideas and their labor

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,100
well first we have to deal with the fact

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:12,150
that the populations those millions are

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,400
very very distracted we all are we are

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,650
doing more and the noise and the

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,700
pressure are greater than ever I feel

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,990
this a lot do you feel this in your

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,320
lives it was a professor from Harvard

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,689
the studies the economics of attention

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,060
and he's found that the cost of our

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,549
attention has risen seven to nine fold

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,470
in just a few decades that's greater

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,869
than the cost and the increase in

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:42,060
inflation in health care so we may know

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,350
what's right and we may want to

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,180
contribute but it's a very different

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,700
thing from actually doing it and that

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,930
does not make us bad it's simply human

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,630
so how do you pull somebody out from

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,950
that and get them to not only pay

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,950
attention but to take action

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:05,040
conceptually it's very simple incentives

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,990
right incentives are chemical they're

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,660
algorithmic if you change the incentives

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,819
you change the action social scientists

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,950
have reams of studies that back this up

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,020
but here's the deal

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,500
this is how many minutes we have in a

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,180
day 1440 and we all do I do everyone in

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,700
the front row all the way to the pack

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,610
corner all the many thousands of us have

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,050
this many minutes in a day so what

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,910
drives a decision to contribute some of

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,459
those minutes to an open-source project

00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,140
versus another well it may be you're

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,640
funded by an employer or it may be

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,600
altruism or maybe you're just trying to

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,500
solve a problem but regardless these

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,489
incentives are not one-size-fits-all

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,280
they're not universal so what if we

00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,370
could create design incentives that

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,420
actually were powerful and universal

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,790
what would they look like in word we get

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,790
them this is where I bring up the

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,200
blockchain part and this maybe you feel

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,220
like a leap for some of you may surprise

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,010
you but block chains are have

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,180
multifunction multi-use tool right

00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,940
entrepreneurs are using them to design

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,540
all kinds of things one of those things

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,930
is to as plumbing for designing

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,200
incentives so let's think about this for

00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,320
a while

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,709
the first blockchain was created to make

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,480
Bitcoin possible and bitcoins digital

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,090
currency but it has an ingenious dual

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,269
role and that is that using game theory

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,790
it also is used to shape behavior in

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,720
bitcoins case that is to incent the

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,690
maintenance in the protection of the

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,000
network there are projects that are

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,950
seeking to do something similar using

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,980
digital tokens right and they're using

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,870
these to shape behavior of all kinds

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,269
it's almost you can imagine it as like a

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,450
virtual currency that's broken out of

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,090
the game and is used to reward behavior

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,799
in real life things that matter actions

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,600
that matter and you can do it at scale

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,540
and these tokens have really interesting

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,760
attributes you can essentially tag and

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,620
register a contribution you can track it

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,480
over time and you can reward it and you

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,190
can even because you have a blockchain

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,019
recording it you could even see impact

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,840
over time with relatively high fidelity

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,109
very high fidelity there's another

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,800
aspect and that is that the more that

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:26,159
join in to the toke the the cause or the

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
network the more the the more valuable

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,610
the token

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,849
it gets the flywheel of change moving

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,610
and it aligns a sentence so it's almost

00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:38,460
as if everyone has skins in the game and

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:41,569
this is why some people call block

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,569
chains incentive machines

00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,629
