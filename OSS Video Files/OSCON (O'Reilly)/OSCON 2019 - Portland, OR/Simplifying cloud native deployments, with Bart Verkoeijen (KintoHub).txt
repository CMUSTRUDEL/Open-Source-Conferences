	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,870
how would you describe the current

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,569
landscape and cloud native technologies

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,099
yeah we've Witkin talked we we actually

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,380
see there's a there's a broad landscape

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,690
with all the cloud native technologies

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,480
out there you have kubernetes containers

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,220
there's a cloud native foundation and in

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,039
fact on their website they have like a

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,300
whole landscape map and it's saying

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,800
there if you go into there it's a

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,260
feeling a little overwhelmed and then

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,240
they have another overview so it's very

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,660
broad and that's really what we what we

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,969
realized that that is challenging and

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,829
it's it's often hard for companies to

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,600
adopt then some of the cloud native

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,270
technologies because they find it's like

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,040
a big hurdle to get going yeah that's

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,809
that's really what we experienced is

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,789
that yeah some of the problems at the

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,070
moment in there on the other side it's

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,469
also amazing technologies right like a

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,989
lot of companies can do amazing things

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,989
these days with those tech yeah

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,640
technologies and how does a gentle hug

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,280
fit into that landscape how are people

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,149
using it sure yeah so we make it very

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,369
simple to do cloud native deployments so

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,439
we use those open-source technologies

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,790
under the hood but we make the workflow

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:14,580
very easy for developers to adopt it and

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:16,770
simplifying the experience so that maybe

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,590
in some cases you don't necessarily need

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,880
a DevOps engineer it's not that we

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,670
remove that completely from the equation

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,290
we actually think DevOps still very

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,810
important that's what we use in that and

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,659
can top a lot as well but we simplify it

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,820
so it's still there but it's a lot

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,159
easier for developers to just get going

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,700
with their applications and would you

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,430
consider kintel have more of a developer

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,560
focus or a DevOps focus company yeah

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,740
sure we actually see other companies and

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,460
out there like open shift pivotal we

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,470
also see others like site Heroku being

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,720
more developer focused the other ones

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,000
were more default focus we find kinto

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,210
have to be right in the middle we try to

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,250
do simplification for developers so that

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,000
they can really yeah again get going

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,210
very quickly

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,569
but at the same time also still offering

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,709
those def up features like I said before

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:13,629
so it's it's the mix of both

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,480
how would you describe the developer

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:19,480
experience on kintel hub yeah we really

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,340
focus on that to make it super simple we

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,349
had a booth here at OSCON and we got a

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,129
lot of compliments for the interface

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:29,470
being very easy to use so it's it's a

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,780
it's a dashboard interface that's how

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,909
how people experience it but we also

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,579
provide tooling and an information

00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:39,129
documentation to understand what these

00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:41,170
cloud native technologies can do so to

00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:43,390
really simplify and get going very

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,709
quickly with the tech well thank you

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,980
very much for talking thank you for

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,980
