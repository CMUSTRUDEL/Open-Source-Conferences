Title: Built to Last - Building and Growing Open Source Communities - Kay Williams (Microsoft)
Publication date: 2019-07-17
Playlist: OSCON 2019 - Portland, OR
Description: 
	Open source has become a cornerstone of many tech stacks. A good idea and few lines of code can be the start of the next big project, but many lose steam because they fail to foster a thriving community to shepherd the project in the years to come. Kay Williams explores key learnings for building strong open source communities based on Microsoftâ€™s real-world experience with Kubernetes and VSCode.

another thing that we've been learning

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,830
is around creating an environment that

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,050
allows multiple companies to play and

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,420
it's really more than feeling like they

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,500
can play but also that there's a level

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,000
playing field and we this is something

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,449
that we've been learning from our

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,769
involvement in the kubernetes community

00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:27,359
Microsoft has an existing cloud

00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,269
orchestration solution and in fact it is

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,940
an open source solution and others have

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,520
cloud orchestration solutions but when

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,710
we talk with customers and partners what

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,030
we find is that many of them prefer to

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,190
work with projects where they have

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,969
started from the ground up to create

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,270
healthy diverse participants in the

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,340
community another place that we've been

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,699
learning is around code stability and

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,789
for open source projects it's very

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,199
important that developers be able to

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,140
start with the code that's public bring

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,900
it internal private make changes in a

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,330
great build test and then be able to

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,340
reintegrate back with the with the

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,130
external with the public project and

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,140
that's not always an easy thing to do so

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,409
this is another place where our vs code

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,810
has spent a bunch of time building a CI

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,210
CD system but these are needs that are

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,369
common across all open source projects

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,530
and this is something that will be we

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,110
are starting to work with some groups in

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:37,070
the community to create common tooling

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,070
around CI CD for open source projects

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,079
