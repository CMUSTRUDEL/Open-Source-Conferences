	00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,060
exactly five years ago today I stumbled

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,030
upon something that was just crazy like

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,190
terrible jarring one of the most awful

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,880
things I've ever seen in my life I

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,610
couldn't believe it

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,400
like most of you I was preparing for a

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,840
day of code and conference calls what

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,800
really actually two fundamentally

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:26,130
incompatible things but bear with me

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:30,210
what I stumbled upon that morning was

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,890
this the idea that a hundred thousand

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,960
people in Detroit we're about to have to

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,180
live without running water because they

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,300
couldn't afford their water bills and if

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,190
you have the misfortune of living in a

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,340
city like Detroit or Baltimore or

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,460
Philadelphia or many other cities in the

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,910
United States if you're too poor to pay

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,250
your water bill they will shut you off

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,860
they don't care if you are elderly

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,210
suffering from Alzheimer's they don't

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,879
care if you've been laid off from your

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,199
job of 20 years they don't even care if

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,920
you're fighting for your life against

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,049
breast cancer

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,330
if you haven't paid your water bill they

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,780
will shut you off so what that basically

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,090
says is that in a country where life

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,700
liberty and the pursuit of happiness is

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,939
written into the Constitution the thing

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,610
that you need for life is not a right

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,080
for you and of course at the time I was

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,280
working in City Hall in Atlanta and I

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,380
thought that was crazy

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,229
and I was really angry about it and I

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,930
didn't just let this die as a story as a

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,070
tab in my browser where I just read it

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,570
and I just go oh that's too bad

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,610
and do nothing about it so what happened

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,340
was that my co-founder and I that same

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,670
day ended up building a website that

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,200
turned into the human utility where we

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,780
connect people who need help with their

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,509
water bills to people who want to give

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,549
and in the first 30 days of doing that

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,649
we paid $100,000 in water bills for

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,320
people people who had lost their jobs

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,630
single parents grandparents folks of

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,659
that sort and so what I'm here to do

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,939
today is kind of like bring the story to

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,220
you all to hopefully inspire someone

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,349
here to try to do the same thing with

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,390
technology with software because we have

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,890
so much at our disposal but I don't

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,620
think we're maximizing the potential

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,110
things I think we really should so the

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,300
first thing that I would say if you want

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,120
to do something like this and use

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,680
software to inspire better living for

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,690
people is to start small even though

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,240
this problem affects over 40 million

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,190
people in the United States we didn't

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,190
let that stop us because we first of all

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,750
we didn't know so all we did was we

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:45,690
threw up a really basic website this is

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:48,209
our first website five years ago and all

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,620
it did was connect people who needed

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,360
help with their water bills to folks

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,330
that didn't who folks who couldn't

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,800
couldn't pay their bills and along those

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,900
lines we ended up finding out that like

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,730
people get shut off for the craziest

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
reasons like they have health problems

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,870
and whatnot but what ended up happening

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,430
is that we connected all these people

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,070
with with help for their water bills

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,830
five years later this is what it looks

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,200
like but again you don't have to start

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,180
fancy which you can do is just throw up

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,980
a really ugly website and go from there

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,260
and if you're doing something that's

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,260
meaningful people will go along with you

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,500
