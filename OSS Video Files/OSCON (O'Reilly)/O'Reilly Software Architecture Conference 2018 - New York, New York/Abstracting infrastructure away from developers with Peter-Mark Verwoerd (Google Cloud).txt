hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,920
software architecture in New York City

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,730
I'm here with Peter mark from Google

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,460
Peter how you doing

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,370
doing all right so you're the global

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,259
head of migration architecture that's a

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,670
lot to unpack can you tell us a little

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,000
bit about what that means and what you

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,460
do

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,770
sure absolutely so I'm part of the

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,740
solution architecture team at Google

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,750
cloud and what our team does is we go to

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,349
our largest and strategic customers to

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,109
help solve problems that are either

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,910
novel in size or in scope so if our

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,910
account teams have encountered something

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,670
that is unusual or just really really

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,219
much larger than they're used to seeing

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,420
they'll call in some of the members on

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,190
our team and we have different

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,500
specialties so people who specialize in

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,170
machine learning or containers DevOps

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,960
and so on my specialty is migration so

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,699
when a customer is migrating something

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,469
on a very large scale say at a data

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,140
center size or multiple data centers

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,699
they want to migrate that to the cloud I

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,160
would go in and talk to that customer

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,140
with the account team so do a lot of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,600
these large companies are they stuck and

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,260
you help unstick them um in some cases

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,909
yeah so when they're saying we've

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,280
progressed to this point we are really

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,100
not sure how to proceed we're really not

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,229
sure where to go or what's the best path

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,670
or it can you talk bring somebody in

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,020
who's got some experience doing this

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,700
sort of thing that's exactly where our

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,100
team would come in to help unstick these

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,180
big customers so and one of the things

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,409
that they're I don't know if they're

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,170
getting stuck with this a lot but

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,259
container seems to be a huge topic

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,689
nowadays and do you see a lot of buzz

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
around that and our customers asking you

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,759
about that or how are you helping them

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,829
get through going from where they are

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,560
today using containers and being in the

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,630
cloud is that part of the migration

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,670
absolutely so we see a lot of excitement

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,530
about getting containers coming from all

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,149
our customers and developers you know

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,070
containers is really important to Google

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,380
it's something that we've been doing for

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,270
over 10 years now we launched over four

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,310
billion containers a week which is kind

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,530
of crazy so it's really it's something

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,110
that's very important to us and so when

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,990
we started looking at creating a

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,610
container service a few years ago we

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,340
really wanted to do it in a way that met

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,840
customer's needs for the cloud but also

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,040
for what they were doing kind of

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,620
anywhere else and so we created

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,210
kubernetes we open sourced it and so we

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,190
have this tool that you can run in

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,260
Google Cloud or anywhere else and it's

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,380
the same tool and so we really wanted to

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,880
make this tool available to customers so

00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,770
that we can start creating an

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,600
open-source ecosystem around it we're

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,700
kubernetes is free to use for anyone and

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,200
the community's really embraced it and

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,209
so we see a lot of tooling coming up

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,680
around that and we've seen customers

00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,450
running kubernetes kind of all over the

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,590
place whether it's in our cloud whether

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,570
they're running in data centers and

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,580
other clouds that's really fantastic and

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,600
so what's happened in the last couple of

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,400
years I don't think there's been a

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,440
single customer conversation that I've

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,420
gone in on when we're talking about

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,130
migrations where containers doesn't come

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,780
up whether or not we're talking about

00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,160
you know applications were written 20

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,110
years ago or something that's still on

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,220
the whiteboard it always comes up

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,870
because people are excited about it

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,450
people want to try it out because it's

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,470
really just a progression towards

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,720
abstracting away infrastructure away

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,700
from developers just one more step so

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,989
developers have less to worry about can

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,489
write more consistent code that can be

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,720
deployed everywhere so everyone's really

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:18,120
pretty excited about it

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,299
kubernetes cloud agnostic it really is

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,709
so kubernetes is a platform for managing

00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:25,620
containers and we see it like I said

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,760
deployed a lot on our cloud and we want

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,230
to make sure you know it's the best

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,239
place to run kubernetes well we

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,220
certainly see a lot of customers running

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,410
it in their own data centers in other

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,900
clouds and really pretty much any

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,030
situation so another topic that I would

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,530
imagine gets some of the larger partners

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,049
that are trying to migrate stuck is

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,580
hearing this term term serverless is

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,380
that a fad or is that something that

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,049
they really have to consider and should

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,340
consider we don't think it's actually a

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,200
fad I could actually I think it's been

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,090
around for a long time so if you look at

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,120
the history of what Google cloud has

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,220
done our first service was Google App

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,600
Engine which is essentially a serverless

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,940
platform you write an application

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,709
developer deploys it to App Engine App

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,440
Engine takes care of everything else it

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,760
deploys it can do different kinds of

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,750
deployments it can load balance it

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,580
scales it up scales it down

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,850
and that's really what a serverless

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,489
platform is what people are seeing today

00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,020
is things like serverless functions

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,940
being deployed by different cloud

00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,400
services it's really just a progression

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,650
along the continuum of different levels

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,090
of compute where you're trading off more

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,650
operational overhead to have more

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,210
control so all the way on one end

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,220
virtual machines where you have total

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,540
control but more operational overhead

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,300
and all the way at the other end is

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,860
functions where you have basically no

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,420
operational overhead all you have to do

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,070
is write a function but it's a total

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,200
black box it's just launched by triggers

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,600
and so this is really just a continuum

00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,400
of different levels of control and so

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,380
serverless is just another natural

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,810
progression we're seeing customers find

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,580
out really interesting in innovative

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,050
ways to use services like this in ways

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,910
that we really haven't seen before and

00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,980
so when you look at something like App

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,420
Engine which is again this kind of

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,190
server this platform we have customers

00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,710
who have been on our platform for a long

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,270
time something like snapchat has been on

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,860
App Engine since the day they launched

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,570
and you know they scale up and scale

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,940
down with no problem and take some

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,930
unholy percentage of teenage web traffic

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,250
every day but we also have recent

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,610
customers something like New York Times

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,290
just moved their crossword application

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,030
stack to App Engine because they found

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,260
that it scaled up and scaled down met

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,400
their needs really really well and

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,590
actually they're gonna talk about that

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,210
at this conference later on so the

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,550
service could then kind of depend though

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,580
on cloud services around it and or is it

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,810
can you run it without cloud I mean well

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,520
it really kind of depends on what you

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,230
want to do I think there are some

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,150
services and there are some products

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,960
that exist kind of wherever you want to

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,610
run them so things like containers and

00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,030
kubernetes and so on I think that runs

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,560
anywhere and if you look at the open

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,530
source ecosystem that is kind of sprung

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,330
up around that and is related to that

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,330
that exists anywhere if you look at

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,320
automationDirect

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,780
sir software configuration tools those

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,850
have existed

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,730
in data centers in cloud and so on and

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,020
they all are part of a very significant

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,160
larger movement in software development

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,530
that's happened in the last couple of

00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,700
years that is certainly related to the

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,920
advancement of cloud but is not

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,450
necessarily dependent on it you can run

00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,520
those systems kind of wherever you want

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,500
and it actually leads to a greater

00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,910
independence of the platform where

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,530
you're deploying your applications so

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,870
you're one of the few companies that I

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,780
hear to say cloud rather than the Google

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,690
cloud or the X cloud or the other X

00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,850
cloud or so is it just the cloud for you

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,460
guys I mean are you really agnostic that

00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:47,070
that all these tools and technologies

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,740
can end server lists can run on all

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,440
clouds so for a long time Google is very

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,500
much embraced open source we're very

00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,420
proactive about releasing new

00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,640
technologies that we think the community

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:03,210
might be interested in might be helpful

00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,669
things like MapReduce and you know

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,500
Google file system and a lot of others

00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:09,780
we release these white papers we

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,370
released open source tools like like I

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,040
said like kubernetes like tensorflow

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,419
like Apache beam because we really want

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,830
to support the open source community we

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,810
feel like we benefit a lot from it and

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,900
we feel like we should be giving back

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,669
and showing the community what we find

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,410
interesting what we find novel and

00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:30,270
creative so there are this these tools

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,220
these a whole host of tools and

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,630
libraries that will run anywhere these

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,220
are open source tools designed to run

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,530
anywhere and so there's a difference

00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,780
between say running kubernetes in the

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,540
cloud which you could do in many clouds

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,700
or running a service say a containerized

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,919
service on Google Cloud say with Google

00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,470
container engine or kubernetes engine

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,060
rather so there is a difference there

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,550
between running in a cloud and running

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,650
in our cloud and certainly we strive to

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,900
make our cloud the best cloud to run

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,640
services in but it doesn't change the

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,910
fact that you could certainly run these

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,380
in any cloud excellent so of all the new

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,510
technologies that are on the horizon

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,270
what do you what do you see is the most

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,000
impactful for developers and let's take

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,350
this on on two fronts one in the fruit

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,060
in the next 12 months what do you

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,040
think's going to just skyrocket up and

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,750
then if you look a little further on the

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,220
horizon like say five years from now

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,940
where do you think people are going to

00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,580
be and what

00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,260
the technology that drives them there

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,340
sure so I think in the short term what's

00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,010
really interesting and this has been

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:32,430
bubbling up for a while so like I said

00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,870
cloud enabled maybe the acceleration of

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,630
more automation which really kind of

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,219
made life easier for developers and

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,650
started with things like on the

00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,940
operation side configuration tools of

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,860
servers things like chef and puppet

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,170
which have now been around for a while

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,210
and then you got to a state where you

00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,190
could start having continuous

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,960
integration tests running all the time

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,550
on things like Jenkins and then you

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,110
start doing going from continuous

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,490
integration to continuous deployment and

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,900
now we're at a state where it's

00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,760
relatively straightforward for just

00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,750
about any company from the moment a

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,490
developer commits code that they can see

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,850
whether their tests pass if they pass

00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,710
they get packaged up deployed

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,870
load-balanced formatted properly without

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,520
anyone having to take manual step if the

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,190
steps that used to take you know teams

00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,900
of operations people you know days or

00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,240
weeks depending on the organization and

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,010
we've automated that entire pipeline and

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,530
it's pretty straightforward this is well

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,180
understood stuff and so we're at a point

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,830
where that's now becoming standard and

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,960
what's coming on top of that is as

00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:34,050
people break down these large monolithic

00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,090
applications into micro services and we

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:37,320
have now hundreds and maybe thousands of

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,120
micro services running around where

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,040
previously people had one application

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,110
these things have to talk to each other

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,080
and so what I see cut happening in the

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,900
kind of short term is more services

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,390
coming along that help developers help

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,160
companies manage a whole fleet of micro

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,200
services so something like Sto which is

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,740
what they're describing as a service

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,540
mesh is really just coming I think it's

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,890
starting to peak and people are going to

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,570
find that incredibly useful as they

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,750
start to decentralize all their

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,890
application work and start making micro

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,920
services they're really gonna find that

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,630
very helpful in the long term I think

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,670
there are kind of a couple of trends

00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,370
that I think will be pretty obvious to

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,780
anyone who's been watching I think

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,370
machine learning and artificial

00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,940
intelligence are going to start really

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,200
becoming far more prevalent in terms of

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,390
what people are doing what people are

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,220
deploying on the kind of applications

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,360
they're looking at making because if you

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,040
see so from the large say

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,140
technology companies you see the rise of

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,089
assistants which are basically based on

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,829
all this machine learning technology

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:42,779
behind them this is only going to become

00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:44,790
more and more prevalent as our

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,290
interaction mechanism with the cloud has

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:52,200
gone from say in its earliest stages the

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,790
web to now mobile is being being more

00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,990
predominant and I think the future is

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,399
gonna be more along the lines of

00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,230
actually just speaking out loud to the

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,970
air and an assistant responding and

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,410
doing these tasks for you and so the

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,899
interaction mechanism is going to become

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,310
much more natural and fluid and even

00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,660
more abstracted away so I think that's

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,320
going to be a big deal in the next

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,760
couple of years

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,079
excellent Peter mark we look forward to

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,769
seeing that future unfold with you

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,769
