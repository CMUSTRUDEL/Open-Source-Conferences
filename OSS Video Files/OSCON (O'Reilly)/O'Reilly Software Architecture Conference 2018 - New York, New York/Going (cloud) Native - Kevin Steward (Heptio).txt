	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,910
so that brings us to today and cloud

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,400
native cloud native is about structuring

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,590
teams culture and technology to use

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,620
automation and architecture to manage

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,929
complexity it is much a way to scale the

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,560
people side of the equation as it is the

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:22,260
technology side it is no longer

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,180
acceptable for a development team to not

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,570
care about how their stuff runs in

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,670
production similarly it is no longer

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,199
acceptable for an Operations team to

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,170
just have an incident occurrence say oh

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,149
well put that solution in a playbook and

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,890
we'll deal with it next time they have

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,120
to take their knowledge and work with

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,829
the development team to make the

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,329
application more operable over time

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:46,860
DevOps promoted the idea that the teams

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,690
that build a service should be the ones

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,390
responsible for deploying that service

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,370
site reliability engineering reinforces

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,100
this idea but supplements it with

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,780
another level of specialization as the

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,850
role of operations becomes much more

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,680
involved in application specific it

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,899
doesn't make as much sense for a single

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,510
team to intone the entire operations

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,720
stack there's an opportunity to break

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,460
down the somewhat monolithic approach of

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,979
operations and have finer grained ops

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,070
specialization in some ways this is a

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,400
type of anti DevOps let's look at this

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,000
from the bottom-up

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,590
infrastructure-as-a-service is

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,570
essentially the first level of

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,210
specialization we can think of this as

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,189
hardware ops and the public cloud

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,619
providers currently fill this role for

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,060
most people many people are still going

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,390
to be running on bare metal so their

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,880
internal operations team will operate as

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,530
hardware ops going a level up is OS ops

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,720
someone has to be focused on getting

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,270
machines up and running with a minimal

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,820
reliable kernel there's already

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,680
definitely a trend towards minimal OS

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,470
distributions focused on hosting

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,860
containers such as core OS Red Hat

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:03,509
Project atomic ranch or OS and VMware

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,430
Photon both hardware ops and OS ops

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,649
focus on physical and virtual machines

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,270
however in the container world we can

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,910
start thinking about a compute cluster

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,190
as a logical infrastructure platform

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,330
and a cluster ops team can use the

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,040
building blocks that a cluster

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,050
orchestration system like kubernetes

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,890
provides to provide self-service

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,360
Operations tools to developers so that

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,760
leads us to the next layer of

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,360
specialization which is application ops

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,850
as in DevOps the dev team can and should

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,550
play this role however each application

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,280
can have a dedicated ops team if deemed

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,230
necessary this ops team is expected to

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,940
go deeper on the application as they

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,000
don't have to be expert in all the other

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,960
layers this alignment of incentives can

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,960
lead to better outcomes

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,530
