hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,640
software architecture in New York City

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,099
I'm here with jaha from and Weinstock

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,499
yes how you doing good

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,360
how's this for you so far oh yeah it's

00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:18,840
wonderful in itself to be in the soft

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:22,230
air-conditioned last year - we have some

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,480
very interesting audience and grace from

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,390
the air like a flight ticketing system

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,120
of the and XM yeah so I'm curious about

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,339
your name - all because it attracted my

00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,829
attention because it wine is in the name

00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:37,309
it started from the idea that we wanted

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,230
to build a good something like wine and

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:42,749
it turned out - you throw a lot of wild

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,949
ashes from the wild lovers would mean

00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:46,800
that we get better over time

00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:48,600
oh yeah of course exactly right right so

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,809
what do you guys actually do what what

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,969
is one song we make a very high

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,139
performance highly performative reverse

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,940
proxy solution post donut server and as

00:00:57,139 --> 00:01:01,979
it's a great solution all software based

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,839
and it caches frequently requested

00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,630
contents upon the first request of the

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:09,630
integers so it's very reliable and

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,100
resilient and performative so does

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,079
someone buy the whole server from you

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,539
and they can sort on all just license or

00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,280
software Alliance software and any

00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:22,469
server is it can rob we we recommend

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,990
standard as long as is standard 64-bit

00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,360
line of servers it's pretty much okay

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,880
with on-premise servers and the cloud

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,280
instance is on Amazon or the azure and

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,680
either way is fine yeah in wouldn't you

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,649
guys do that's extremely useful for

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,200
someone who wants to use affirmative

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:45,359
it's it's it's according to the lab test

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,250
and the bill test is top of the notch in

00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,680
terms of very low latency and stupid

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,440
and planned ways to cover the outburst

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,720
yes and we'll provide breaks extensive

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,430
live monitoring features was in the

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,800
client science at the origin side as

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,220
well we have some features for the image

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,950
or the video delivery on converting on

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,149
the fly as well easy to scale as well

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,600
absolutely yeah

00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:13,640
we currently we have about 3000 while

00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,110
3,300 copies up and running right now we

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,450
started about seven years ago in South

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,540
Korea and all the local citizens are

00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,190
happy with that and we have some

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,120
enterprise customers from the retailer's

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,680
or the streaming services yes so are

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,200
there any industries that are migrating

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,440
towards high-performance servers faster

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:39,020
than other industries we simply I would

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:41,480
say there the e-commerce especially when

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,910
it comes to make fly sale event and also

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,510
there we some new customers would be

00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,550
like a flight booking systems - yeah ok

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,060
mic mic working yeah a hotel booking

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,720
right right right yeah exactly

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,310
maybe concerts and events

00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,640
so where do you see this going in the

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,090
future

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,450
Oh retailers or do booking systems is

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,160
huge and be a kind of view we started

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,140
actually with just with the caseta and

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,660
customers but seems like the marketing

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,780
suspending to this we send them

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,550
enterprise level customers too so that's

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,410
probably the next level that here I'll

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,970
be together enterprise connoisseurs who

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,990
want their own CVS right right right

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,580
this is a great CDN so were you seen a

00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,290
lot of those type companies the inner

00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:33,110
large enterprises building out their own

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:36,350
City area is pretty big market that too

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,150
so you and I meet again next year in New

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,950
York what would you like to say it's

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,140
gonna change for you guys over the next

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:45,200
12 months that's four months we will

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:53,900
live there is some new Protocol's coming

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:56,180
up from Google paged us 265 and those

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,560
kind of brother posterior and those will

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:06,620
all run on top of way right well great

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:09,530
Linden also from the framework called

00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,680
and it's very reliable so I think we can

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,290
go further than that all right

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,959
if there's one area that you think you

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,389
do better than everyone what is that oh

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,820
yeah that's that's a very good question

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:26,030
and um it's uh we are very good at

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,310
handling those well protocols protocol

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:32,360
transactions so that's how we come up

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:36,290
with this cache and while doing that we

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,240
also provide very rigorous monitoring

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,720
features as well as it's very

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,500
transparent solution that you can

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,450
exactly look through how this

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,250
transactions are going and coming so you

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,410
have some sort of transparency or view

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,720
into what's happening right excellent so

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,130
do you have a DevOps dashboard or

00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,479
something that people can see what's

00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:01,580
happening throughout system well for now

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:10,030
the concept of the product that server

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:10,030
is it came from the solution is built to

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,840
operators is in itself you don't have to

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,730
code anything so it's very easy to adopt

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,570
for that that loves people as well so

00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:25,880
it's more of the operation size right

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,950
all these configurations are in XML so

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,390
it's very easy to use aha we look

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,590
forward to seeing you in 12 months from

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,590
