hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,589
software architecture in New York City

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,270
I'm here with Renee Bostick from IBM

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,560
Renee how're you doing I'm doing great I

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,480
want to say thank you for this

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,090
opportunity I would like to say thank

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,969
you too so you work at IBM in a cloud

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,500
group that's correct the IBM cloud the

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,690
IBM cloud is that different than other

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,529
clouds of course that's the only one

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,019
right that's more secure their

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,430
enterprise ready yes sir so what are

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,010
some of the interesting things you guys

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,380
are doing with your IBM cloud offerings

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,870
are there interesting applications

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,370
interesting technologies that converge

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,070
with it what are some of the more

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,750
interesting things you see happening

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,210
right so what I wanted to just start off

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,190
is to look at the IBM cloud architecture

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,870
because that's probably the blueprint if

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,120
you will that we can talk about the IBM

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,820
cloud and I think it really centers on

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,039
three things the first is you know

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,570
creating scalable cloud native

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,699
applications we've been talking about

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,430
cloud native apps now for quite some

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,070
time so that would be the first area and

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,860
it's not considered if you will on just

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,130
you know what workload needs to be in

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,750
the cloud or where I'm hosting my

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,060
applications in the cloud it's centered

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,939
on how do I maximize the cloud in order

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,100
to create new revenue streams right new

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,159
business models so that's the first area

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,159
and then the second area is centered on

00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:26,130
security which is close to many you know

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,330
c-suites their hearts and so when you

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,270
look at it that from that perspective

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,970
it's is your security built in and not

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,460
bolted and right is it a happy dawn all

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,770
right all right at it all right so is it

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,900
inherent into the entire cloud

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,509
architecture with as as you know iBM has

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,119
a security division and so therefore

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,229
when we look at cloud security well

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,640
looking at it all the way from the

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:52,290
identity of the person coming into the

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,930
cloud all the way to hardware encryption

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,600
so all the way throughout the entire

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,540
framework and then the third area is

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,659
creating new business applications and

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,280
new services such as you know many

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,940
customers find themselves in a multi

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,830
cloud invar

00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,890
I thought oh well we're gonna do one

00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,040
cloud and so now so they look around

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,470
with shadow IT many departments want to

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,020
spawn up a cloud instance and only pay

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,990
for that and then deprovision it and so

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,750
multi cloud has been very big cognitive

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,670
has been another area that's been very

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,560
well focused and then blockchain has

00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,020
been a 30 or so is cognitive part of the

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,600
AI movement yes true yeah true but the

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,940
nice thing about you know I'm cognitive

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,820
is it takes it a step further and it's

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,850
and it's my system really learning can I

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,100
train it right can I can I be able to

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,740
provide some different patterns and

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,190
modern are models that we can anticipate

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,560
what I want to do not just react so

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,450
those are all three major components of

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,010
the IBM cloud right well I'm just saying

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,630
right as we have involved right I mean

00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,670
if you look at it you still have your

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,010
your infrastructure as a service layer

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,240
you know your path layer etc but those I

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,380
wanted to talk about a little bit more

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,970
of some of the new things and the

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,320
capabilities and one of the new things

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,330
that you mentioned at the very end is

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,750
blocked changed right and blockchain

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:15,209
running in the cloud provides what to an

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,300
enterprise what would an enterprise that

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:20,489
doesn't know about blockchain comes to

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,680
IBM and say hey we hear that blockchain

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:25,350
can help us right how does it help an

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,209
enterprise right and so how I explain it

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,010
is the value of blockchain is really

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:34,380
centered on trusted transactions just as

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,989
is similar to how the Internet is to

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,350
communications right today and so when

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,330
you're looking at trusted transactions

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:47,430
blockchain provides that capabilities

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:49,920
where we can have assets participants as

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,220
well as you know the transactions all

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,800
onto a distributed ledger right making

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,250
sure that we all are participating in

00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,650
and in a network a business network

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,540
solving a specific problem and there's

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,430
no way the Russian bots can get into

00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,030
that network and influence the

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,900
blockchain in that

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:14,530
network well great question again top of

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,260
- security is built-in so I think you

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,590
may be aware iBM has selected hyper

00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,800
ledger fabric which is a part of a hyper

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:27,940
ledger project working with the Linux

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,520
Foundation and with that particular area

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,800
you know blockchain is permissioned so

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,410
therefore identity is key so we work

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,450
with certificate keys to authenticate

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,910
people onto the blockchain we have

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,500
something called consensus where the

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,480
participants of the blockchain business

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,820
network have to agree what is going to

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,320
be written onto the block and then that

00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:52,780
block is encrypted using hash and so

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,570
when you look at all the components of

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,450
the security model and it's also

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,010
immutable you can't change it that's why

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,900
you can say it's trusted that's correct

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,590
because to me it seems like it's a

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,350
peer-to-peer

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,750
kind of thing and yet it's trusted right

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,200
and that they typically don't go

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,229
together

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,729
that's right fear - fear tries to say

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,160
well that's what we're creating with

00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,229
watching that old trust across the

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,110
business name so would you you know

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,320
since this is trusted would you put all

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,840
your money in it if it's true and like

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,600
let's say it was a blockchain from a

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,630
bank and that's the bank you use would

00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,070
you use blockchain to to transfer funds

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,289
and use it like that way because it's

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,660
trusted well you know that's a great way

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,130
to look at it because this is the sake

00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,479
of wait what is the business case and

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,030
what is the problem I'm trying to solve

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,910
so the question now is Renet today do

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:50,770
you trust your bank and if I do right

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,690
then it might not be an issue but you

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,880
know and and I think you know or have

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,850
heard IBM has decided not to participate

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,440
in cryptocurrency as an asset on the

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:02,320
block and that's the Bitcoin part I got

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,460
Bitcoin either right or either different

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,190
right so I owed a little yeah the idea

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,590
is the iot cryptocurrency

00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,630
correct so what we want to focus on our

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,380
assets whether they are tangible or

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,850
intangible assets

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:21,950
that you know provides a way of

00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,810
traceability that where all the parties

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,120
back to your point can establish trust

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,580
and so one of the most I think popular

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,700
use cases for blockchain is centered on

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,310
the farm to fork how do you know that

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:41,570
the food that you eat is organic as an

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:43,730
example and so right and so you know

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,790
leveraging blockchain technology again

00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,680
the asset could be a type of food and

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,080
then the participants could be then the

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,970
farmer the packaging company the

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,020
distribution company as well as the

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,520
supermarket so those are the

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,010
participants and then how are they going

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,100
to interact their transactions to

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,410
guarantee that that food is then organic

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,150
and that is all written on to the

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,810
blockchain do consensus everybody

00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,730
agreeing that this food is so blockchain

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,480
could really work in almost every

00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:17,930
industry absolute achill correct

00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:20,120
ethical medical we have what IBM Watson

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,910
healthcare right now that's working with

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,850
many companies working with them on the

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,460
electronic health record and so now can

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,550
you imagine you now will be able to get

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,130
permission to different doctors

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,390
hospitals specialists on whether they

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,400
should have access to your medical

00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:42,380
record or not I'd be great right and I

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,750
walk in and just they scan my code and

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:51,560
they have all my axis taxa for every

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:52,430
country so that's where we're going

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,410
that's where are we going and that's

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,550
where the trust comes into and so back

00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,220
to my point and the reason why I was

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,170
saying about the banking application you

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,760
know it depends on where do you have

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,120
trust or not have trust and say for

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,950
instance you know many I guess when they

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,840
looked at the Bitcoin and the ether it

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,850
was can I do peer-to-peer without a bank

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,950
right but there are some things I think

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,480
that if you look at banking there's a

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,520
regulatory you know

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,930
that you have to take into consideration

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,790
and I think that's why IBM said you know

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,950
what cryptocurrency is not really the

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,100
area we want to be in but I I know that

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,960
many large banks are working across the

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,940
Bitcoin the etherium and the hyper

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,220
ledger and environments to find out what

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,530
is the right answer for banking so

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,700
that's why you know I I just kind of

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,080
stayed away a little bit from the

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,030
cryptocurrency piece because that's not

00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,240
where I am sweet all right we say and

00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:45,000
Trust is the same as secure because to

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,100
me I I could trust someone but I could

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,600
still lose whatever I have in in that

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,020
medium right I could have money in

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,890
something or I could have voting numbers

00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:01,200
in something and I trust the person that

00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,390
I've given that data to or contributed

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,120
to but that doesn't necessarily mean

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:10,170
it's safe does it you're absolutely

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,720
right so Trust really stems from do we

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,020
all go greed do we all have consensus

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,250
that this is indeed the right answer

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:22,680
right so security then says do I have

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,950
access to the right answer okay

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,400
to me that's just my decision that's a

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:33,060
good distinction yeah so where do you

00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,920
see AI BM in your cloud and all the

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:37,950
different things that you're doing in it

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,110
in the next twelve months from now wait

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,670
let's say we sit down next year here in

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,490
New York and we have this conversation

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,410
so and I say we Renee what's changed

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,300
with IBM what do you hope to be saying

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,520
right well I will tell you when you

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,280
looked at IBM and blockchain let's say

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,780
two years ago it was working with many

00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,730
companies to come up with what is that

00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,130
right business case what is that right

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,770
use case you know do you have a lack of

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,840
trust across your supply chain across

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,510
multiple partners and so we worked

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,520
really diligently to make sure that we

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,410
established some what we call blockchain

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,350
consortiums I mean a couple companies

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,040
together like the food the farm to fork

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,200
scenario right being able to really

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,840
identify you know which participants

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,450
were wearing that now

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,610
really shifting to say why don't we

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,890
provide an IBM blockchain platform that

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,440
makes it easy to onboard those

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,110
participants to write the policies that

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,630
everybody can adhere to and so a year

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,610
from now I believe the conversation will

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,610
shift over where you and I'll be talking

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,980
about hey Renee can you tell me of your

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,080
active blockchain business networks can

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,940
you share some lessons learn with us how

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,880
easy it is really to stand up a

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:53,330
blockchain business network you know you

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,430
know what are they experiencing new

00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,440
business models will being created you

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,970
know those kind of things so I think

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,470
I'll be able to share a little bit more

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,930
about that with real life case studies

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,720
that are happening that are happening

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,340
yeah and do you one one follow-on to

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,080
that do you see any industries that are

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:13,490
ahead in kind of adopting blockchain

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,050
technologies for their enterprise yes

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,300
are there industries that are further

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,630
ahead yes I would say and believe it or

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,000
not because of Bitcoin is etherium you

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,160
would say that finance was first so it's

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,810
on board on blockchain because as you

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,620
know ether and Bitcoin sit on top of

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,990
blockchain

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,830
but coming very close it would be

00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,270
government's do by this I think you have

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,840
may have heard about their government

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:41,210
being able to do a identity so I as a

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,730
citizen will have all of my credentials

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:49,880
on the blockchain my driver's license my

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:52,970
passport you know my birthday right

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,610
so government we talked about IBM Watson

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,530
health so healthcare is coming up fast

00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:59,000
because of the electronic health we have

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,500
to opt in to all these different things

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,270
because there may be some things that

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,010
don't want to opt into oh you could

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,870
absolutely well so they'll be different

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,570
they're almost like a module that you

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,300
opt into different blockchain now you're

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,840
getting into architecture right I mean

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,460
it all depends with helmets 18 of these

00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,560
robots will they have their own work

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:23,210
chains that's next year absolutely so so

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,070
but back to your but back to your

00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,160
question you know so government

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:30,810
healthcare I would say those are the

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,240
really big areas right now district

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:40,050
you ssin is another one you know we have

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:43,110
companies looking at it retail

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,660
very very important you know customer

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,820
loyalty type programs and that making

00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,160
sure I'm who I say I am so that they can

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,230
then leveraging cognitive capabilities

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,410
sell to me more effectively could it

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,029
help TSA see you trying to get political

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,040
I was told to stay away from

00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,380
oh yeah well know what two million I'd

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,270
be wonderful if all my my credentials

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,920
were on something I put in front of the

00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,850
you know when you scanned it on a plane

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,800
and they immediately know you just

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,330
process through or you don't right but

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,670
you know what's interesting I won't get

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,580
on a tangent but think about you know

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:21,540
TSA you we have Global Entry we have

00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:27,930
concur we have you know preaching can't

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:31,070
we just have everything on the Rene we

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,070
