	00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:15,760
you guys yeah it's it kind of reflects a

00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,390
convergence of trends we've observed

00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,310
traditionally light band has been

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,710
focused on micro-services kind of

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,120
anything from e-commerce sites to

00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,730
whatever it is you're building that

00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,710
needs to be much more scalable resilient

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,199
durable all the things people worry

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,239
about today and then it was like this

00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,800
big data world where people were a

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,440
little bit more oriented towards like

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,140
data warehousing bad jobs just get the

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,460
data do something with it later but then

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,350
they realize you know what we really

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,380
ought to be stream processing this data

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,059
so we get answers faster user

00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,640
infrastructure more effectively rather

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,170
than have these big bursts of activity

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,540
and that kind of pushed them more to be

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,880
more like microservice systems because

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,710
now they have to meet the same kind of

00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,840
requirements for you know I'm gonna run

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,910
this thing for months let's say I'm

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,699
gonna hit every possible problem so how

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,229
do I build durability resiliency all the

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,450
things that these micro service guys

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,939
have been doing so we built this fast

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,770
data platform to kind of bridge those

00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,780
two and bring them together you know our

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,869
expertise and kind of a micro service

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,539
side our expertise in the data side from

00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,490
people like me and for people trying to

00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,959
do more stream processing but still

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,090
integrated with all of their micro

00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,340
service activity I just give you an

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,319
example of what we're seeing a lot is I

00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,359
might be doing the traditional

00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,189
e-commerce stuff but now I want to bring

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:36,619
in machine learning recommendations you

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,719
know like here's your you know shopping

00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:40,609
cart oh you might want to buy this kind

00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,399
of stuff that we all see up when we shop

00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:45,229
online so a lot of what the fast data

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,350
platform is trying to do is to bridge

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,380
those two so what it is is essentially

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:53,710
a curated distribution of open-source

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,509
tools surrounded with commercial

00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,790
packaging so you can get all the

00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,979
production illa tees that you need

00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,350
including monitoring and all that kind

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,149
of stuff but that's the goal is to

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:10,390
address that kind of convergence of

00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:11,890
architecture yeah it can be all of that

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,350
it can be all of the above because what

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,940
we actually sell is this platform that

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,510
you deploy where you want

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,700
it's basically running on DCOs the

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,500
mercial distribution of maces from

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,130
mesosphere so you can deploy it in the

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,459
cloud on-premise transparently across

00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,260
boundaries in some cases so yeah the

00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:34,600
reality is everyone wants to be on the

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,640
cloud but in reality people are mostly

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,950
still relieved in their own data centers

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,660
and are being very you know deliberate

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,640
about those migrations so we're trying

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,640
to bridge the gap for both

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,720
yeah that's that's the intent yeah it's

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,519
it's sort of representative of the way

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,170
things work today where we just bring a

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,620
lot of tools together from different

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,180
sources and either you do it yourself as

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,519
far as integrating them and figuring out

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,049
which ones actually makes sense or you

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,819
come to somebody like us he's kind of

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,489
done that homework give you an

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,470
integrated package you know a suite of

00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,540
recommended options to use like we have

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,549
like for streaming engines for example

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,650
to cover the spectrum of what you might

00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:23,690
need but if you need to add other things

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,970
that we don't provide like I want to run

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,160
Cassandra or I want to run elasticsearch

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,959
or those things you know they all just

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,239
run nicely on the platform so you can

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,400
basically have an ecosystem that you a

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:41,239
starting point and then you can bring in

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:42,590
what additional stuff you need yeah

00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,599
that's the funny thing and so the word

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,489
real-time is heavily overused so we're

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,810
not doing like flight telemetry or not

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:53,750
trying to land Rockets on barges

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:55,010
necessarily yes it's it's no it's but it

00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,780
done but again there is actually a

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,959
spectrum there where some people do want

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,250
to have things happen in the millisecond

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,319
you know tens to hundreds of

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,599
milliseconds and other people for them

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,000
you know real-time or fast enough is

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,310
really you know a few minutes rather

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,380
than wait a few hours if I can get the

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,680
answer in five minutes that's that's

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,680
okay

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:22,620
our real-time versus I think so yeah so

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,860
in some cases you'll even see system I

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,960
don't like a lot of financial companies

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,200
and real estate so for they still work

00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,490
in the world of FTP files around so you

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,290
might have a stream that's just sitting

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,600
there waiting for a file to show up in

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,950
an FTP server and then you just run it

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,139
through the pipe but at least you've

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:51,840
done it as soon as possible even though

00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:55,760
you might be waiting for that file yeah

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,110
so we helped spearhead this sort of

00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,480
industry initiative called reactive

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,160
manifesto which is sort of inspired by

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,610
the agile manifesto wasn't trying to be

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,870
too prescriptive just to lay out some

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,000
hallmarks of what these systems need to

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,100
be in order to you know meet the kind of

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,990
requirements people have you know always

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,430
on so the we color platform of

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,660
microservice tool it's a reactive

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,400
platform implemented around those

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,350
criteria and designed to help people

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,380
achieve them in their own development

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,140
without having to reinvent the wheel and

00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,789
those products include log amis are

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,530
micro service framework I'll just want a

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:38,400
sticker up here vlog on

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:40,620
it's our opinionated micro service

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,930
framework and it's built on top of our

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,539
play web framework and our akka

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:48,570
middleware framework which are really

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,130
flexible highly capable tools but they

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,050
kind of assume you know what to do with

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,240
them whereas log em tries to give you

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,250
guidance about you really ought to do it

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,860
this way rather than that way kind of

00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,360
opinion a yeah opinionated exactly and

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,640
then we've been supporting Scala from

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,289
the beginning as well there's a one

00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,610
option for a programming language but

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:08,030
you can certainly use any jaebeum

00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,030
language

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,919
yeah I there's a couple of trends that I

00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:23,940
really watch carefully one is that

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,860
people are responding to our initiatives

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,050
that helping them do better data

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,550
processing in a streaming context

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,949
because they know they need to do that

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,979
it's a competitive advantage but they

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,060
also know that they need to make that

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,680
you know for getting this timely

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,060
information more timely than they were

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,889
in the past they really wanted

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,270
integrated with the rest of their

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,060
infrastructure so they could leverage

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,220
the data so they're finding that

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:52,139
appealing that they can get kind of

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:53,970
converged expertise from us to to bridge

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,680
that gap between their data processing

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,169
and their the rest of their service and

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,639
so what we're finding is a lot of that

00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,210
is just kind of driving our growth

00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,340
driving our attention and we're starting

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:07,650
to think about some specific use cases a

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,240
little bit more carefully like you're

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,770
serving machine learning models like

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,389
this this book here thinking about some

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,800
of the specific problems people are

00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,729
running into a particular vertical

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,229
industries like you know GPR and Finance

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:24,000
but actually most companies are affected

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:28,590
by these new European privacy

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,419
regulations in general helping companies

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,580
figure out how to how do I apply this

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,680
technology to the particular problem

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,050
domain I have whether it's finance or

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,759
IOT or any of these things so that's

00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,719
kind of what's driving our attention

00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,739
right

00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:45,189
hey it's great talking to you as always

00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:45,189
