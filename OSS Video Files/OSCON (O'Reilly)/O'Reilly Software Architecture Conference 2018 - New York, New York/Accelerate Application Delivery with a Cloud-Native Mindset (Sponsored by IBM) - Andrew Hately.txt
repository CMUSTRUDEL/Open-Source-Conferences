it's really exciting to be in front of a

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,780
bunch of software architects and

00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,960
hopefully you realize that you and and

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,429
those of you who are also developers

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,660
we're at one of the most interesting

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:22,609
moments I would say in in terms of a

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,980
wave of computing the demands that our

00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:27,330
customers our users place on us are

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,359
pretty extraordinary and their

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:34,460
expectations for intuitiveness of our

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,719
applications continue to grow every day

00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,129
I've been on this cloud journey with

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,890
with IBM for a number of years the cloud

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,500
native journey that you've heard so many

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,590
people talk about this morning is the

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,079
beginning of a pretty fantastic journey

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,820
and since we're in New York I figured

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,710
there's no better way to talk about a

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,399
journey than to try to use something

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,649
that looks like a subway map a lot of

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,780
people you know that we hear from they

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,570
come into this from a perspective of you

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,040
know a kind of clean slate I'm building

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,549
a web scale company or an application

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,830
born on the web that's not what we all

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,869
have right many of us come at this from

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,909
a perspective of I've got an existing

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:23,610
business I've got an existing customer

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:25,560
experience and I need to figure out how

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,430
to innovate and adapt and get to this

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,930
new place and whether you're coming at

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,090
it from a perspective of you know

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,909
adopting some new practices or DevOps

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,040
practices refactoring your applications

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,490
to be more cloud native or maybe

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,200
extending them to do something new for

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,710
the most part the destination is is

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,259
scale right it is enabling the business

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,079
you work for to achieve a new level of

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,659
scale now for me it's easy to think of

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,939
this scale in terms of what you know

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,799
whether calm and the experience we run

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,710
that's scaled in the traditional sense I

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,600
have a lot of users I have a lot of web

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,360
page hits I have five hundred and thirty

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,690
million plus weather reports every day

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,450
right it's a lot of data it's a lot of

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,980
scale that's what a lot of us think

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,420
about like oh I've got to be able to

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,340
scale the front end of my business

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,020
absolutely true right that's one

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,700
pressure a lot of what we've done in

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:25,800
cloud native is really a architecture

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,920
reaction to having to deliver that kind

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,489
of scale but I want to also make you

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,980
think of one other aspect of scale I'm

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:39,000
sure a lot of you have daughters or sons

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,340
or nieces or nephews here and they have

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,500
a kind of different expectation for how

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,319
things work

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,810
they don't necessarily read the manuals

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,090
that come with the software we built or

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,680
the applications in fact they picked

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,120
phones up and they expect them to work

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,560
it's always fun to watch a two-year-old

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,420
with a phone and you realize they've

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,519
figured out how to do things on the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,830
phone that we in our lives haven't

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,750
figured out how to do what they expect

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:10,260
now is in intuitive systems and building

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,049
an intuitive system on top of something

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,190
that was maybe built 10 20 years ago

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:19,620
that also drives scale that drives a new

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:22,290
pressure on the application architecture

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,880
and when we look back at what Adrian and

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,690
Nora we're talking about this morning a

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,269
lot of that system testing those new

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,970
paths those new modes of failure those

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,239
new pressures that we have to test for

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,609
and push they're coming on some of our

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,209
existing systems because we're

00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:46,350
introducing new experiences and those

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:48,810
new experiences are very very compute

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,760
intensive right so when we look at

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,350
existing applications and sometimes what

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,390
we're timeout is we have to build a new

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,620
cloud native front-end why are we

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,090
building that new front-end we're

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,220
generally building it because we're

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,380
trying to bring a new experience to our

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,840
users something hyper intuitive

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,030
something that interacts if I ask

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,319
somebody under 30 when they interact

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,299
with the company do they want to

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,150
interact with a human when they hit the

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,680
call center the answer is actually if I

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,630
give them the alternative they will tell

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,239
me I would rather interact with a chat

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,100
bot we didn't build these systems that

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,890
way and now what we have to figure out

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,039
is as we move on this cloud native

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,780
journey what do we do what do we pick we

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,780
can certainly take what we've done

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,420
and goto kind of the right side of this

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,430
and say well it's really easy to migrate

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,890
bare-metal cloud or VMs I can just bring

00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,470
forward what I have and four parts of

00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,700
the system that's absolutely true but if

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,990
you want to do everything you heard

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,330
about this morning and you want to be

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,710
super flexible and super scalable we

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,010
actually have to go to the other side of

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:52,680
this we actually have to get opinionated

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,540
about our programming model now I'm sure

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,800
everyone in this room probably has an

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,760
opinion about programming language

00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,460
everybody has an opinion about

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,380
programming language I have an opinion

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,850
about packaging I have an opinion about

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,070
configuration and I have an opinion

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,200
about deployment you can probably pick

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,850
in any one of these environments the

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,240
language of your choice but what is

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:14,490
truly tricky is getting to a point an

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,450
understanding cloud native that is an

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,919
opinion about deployment so when we look

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,450
at containers when we look at cloud

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,030
foundry and we look at things like

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,500
functions a lot of the opinion that's

00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,020
coming into the picture here and what we

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,110
need to get used to is an opinion about

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,630
deployment so I'll leave you with one

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,940
last side those three boxes to the right

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,250
and we can drill into them this more

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,229
this afternoon and the experts bar and a

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,430
number of the sessions here today I want

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,470
people to walk away and say you know

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,229
what I need to go back with an opinion

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,240
about deployment I need to go back on an

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:52,130
opinion boat cloud native because it is

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,910
actually that opinion those pre-existing

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,470
configuration and deployment patterns

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,510
that get you on this cloud native

00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,760
journey and start to enable you to scale

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,100
so this is my quick intro I really

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,780
appreciate your time this morning is

00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,050
awesome to be part of this Power has

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,729
lineup of speakers and with that I thank

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,160
you for attention and hope to talk to

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,690
you more this afternoon about those

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,889
three options for very opinionated cloud

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,949
native dablam thank you

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,949
you

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,199
