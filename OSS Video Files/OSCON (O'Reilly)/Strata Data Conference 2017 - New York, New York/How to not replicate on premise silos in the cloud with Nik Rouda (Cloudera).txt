hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,759
data in New York City I'm here with Nick

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,350
from cloud era and Nick how you doing

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,880
good I'm really happy to be here it's an

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,630
exciting event so how's the show been

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,950
for you so far

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,509
oh it's been wonderful we've had two

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,130
product launches we've had some great

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,630
keynotes lots of good customer

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,020
information sessions it's been really

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,380
fun

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,820
so I you know there's a trend that I've

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,310
seen and I think a lot of people have

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,359
seen lately about people moving to

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,010
public clouds why well cloud has a lot

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,720
of things that fit nicely with a big

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,700
data environment one is scale obviously

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,350
you want to continue to grow and capture

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,000
more data and then be able to leverage

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,579
that data another piece of it is

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,530
elasticity which is the ability to spin

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,480
up resources use them for an analytics

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,680
job and then eliminate them when you're

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,030
done so you're not paying for them so

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
there's some parts of clouds that are

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,030
good for their scale and persistence or

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,770
on the storage there's some parts of

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,270
cloud that are good for their transients

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,160
like bringing a different application or

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,300
analytics workload as you go is there a

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,070
difference between the public and

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,440
private though why why do people like

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,420
them so provisioning equipment

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,520
on-premises is always a challenge you

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,159
need to find the equipment and select it

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,380
sources ship it install it can integrate

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,119
it there's a lot of pre-work steps that

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,470
if you're really interested in doing the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,720
analytics getting insights getting

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,360
answers going through some of that pain

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,570
feels like delay and hurts productivity

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,060
so cloud in many ways is very Fasil

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,509
makes it easier to be agile as a

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,430
business I think that on premises for

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,290
long running workloads make sense and

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,780
cloud makes sense for other types of

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,850
environments so you guys work with a lot

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,060
of organizations and some very large

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:38,520
enterprises do you see gotchas and and

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,020
like pitfalls that these some of these

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,899
companies are going through when they're

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,920
trying to get to a cloud solution

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:45,390
definitely there there's some things

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,070
we've learned working with our customers

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,570
along the way things we've observed and

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,369
people come to us and say our pains I

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,630
would say the number one issue we're

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:53,520
seeing is people accidentally

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,950
replicating the silos they've had

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,170
on-premise so having one environment for

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,820
a database workload another one for a

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,000
data warehouse another one for machine

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,009
learning and so you end up accidentally

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,110
taking what seems like a nice unified

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,459
resource and fragmenting it up and the

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,050
biggest challenge in that then is of

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,180
course there's a lot of rework we need

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,240
to then recreate security policies

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,140
governance paul

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,980
we need to manage each set of data

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,870
independently and we end up with a lot

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,730
of done Dhin see in work and redundancy

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,920
and resource utilization and cost so

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,170
trying to get cloud to be that concept

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,270
of a unified data source and then bring

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,340
your workloads as you need is what where

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,840
people really need to end up and and

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,820
that's but that that may not be

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,800
repeatable for all enterprises right so

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,380
everyone's different one size doesn't

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,450
fit all so how do you see that working

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,690
for a lot of the enterprises that want

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,760
to move to a public cloud do they have

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,320
special requirements that make it more

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,090
difficult for them yeah they're

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,460
certainly by industry at varies quite a

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,410
bit there are different regulations or

00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,720
best practices or interesting industry

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,910
standards they need to adhere to but

00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,010
what we spend a lot of our time doing is

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,870
coaching customers and what workloads

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,820
make sense where they're gonna be

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,640
restricted where maybe keep it an

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,780
on-premises does make the right decision

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,090
for their environment that's gonna be

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,820
long-running cloud costs can add up as

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,190
you scale over time but finding which

00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,540
ones are transient which ones are going

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,040
to be dynamic where they're gonna get

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,410
more agility out of cloud I think that's

00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,240
really where you want to do a critical

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,920
self assessment of your environments and

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,400
find the right choice and do you help

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,440
your enterprise partners decide which

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,990
applications go into a public cloud

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,550
because that's also kind of it could be

00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,960
difficult so we've we've looked at what

00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,870
workloads are most suitable one of the

00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,550
things we announced this week was our

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,080
Altis which is a data engineering

00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,630
platform as-a-service

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,220
running in a Microsoft Azure cloud now

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,320
whether it's the upcoming beta we have

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,150
its join in AWS so that actually makes a

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,890
multi cloud experience for something

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,720
like data engineering data engineering

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,820
of course is a transient type of thing

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,380
you need to do as preparation to get

00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,780
into machine learning get into analytics

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,850
but it's a necessary first step so using

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,410
cloud for that type of environment is

00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,120
one example of ways we're making it

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,400
easier for people they focus on the

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,830
tasks not the infrastructure the other

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,810
thing we really wanted to set up for

00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,170
them is if you do have transient compute

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,550
environments not losing the data context

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,859
not losing the information about

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,200
security or governance or keeping audit

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:22,650
or logs and lineage information all of

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,180
that needs to be preserved and so

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,770
detaching that from your computer

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,920
cluster your analytics application and

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,140
put

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,850
with the data that is persistent in the

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,050
storage layer that's something else

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,610
we're doing with what we call our shared

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,780
data experience and it's another way

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,450
we're helping people move in this

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,690
direction so just like I asked you a

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:44,050
couple minutes ago about gotchas and

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,090
pitfalls that customers go through do

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,550
you have some success criteria that you

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,040
can identify that your enterprise

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,560
partners that have gone through this

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,000
journey to get to a public cloud some of

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,370
the criteria that made them successful

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,230
yeah to get there I think I think it's

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,330
really important to look at your skills

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,880
as a team look at your business

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,590
processes as a function other these are

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,830
strictly technology yet mind you and

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,780
then doing a assessment of the needs of

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,850
the application and more often we

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,700
recommend you bring your applications to

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,890
the workload rather than bring the data

00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,030
vice-versa this physics problems and

00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,770
cost problems and all kinds of other

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,690
complications but what we're seeing is

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,830
for the highest value big data

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,450
applications they tend to be

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,460
multidisciplinary in nature we're

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,350
combining some elements of BI and data

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,020
warehouse with machine learning and

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,880
predictive analytics with maybe IOT

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,830
sensor information and that needs to

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,780
stream in and be updated as it as it

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,800
goes so being able to combine those

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:44,020
types of again multi modal analytics if

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,460
you will together is really where we see

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,860
people have the most success and then

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,940
they get the highest value use cases out

00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,950
of those they're able to predict things

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,170
that any single one analytics approach

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,880
wouldn't otherwise tell them and and are

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,860
you able to stitch that together quickly

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,750
I mean is that like almost real-time or

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,630
streaming so so that's been a big part

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,520
of our effort in related to some of our

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,980
announcements this week is being able to

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,330
help people be more agile help them be

00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,250
able to run multidisciplinary

00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,140
applications as I said not have to

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,310
recreate the data context even as

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,050
they're using it with different users

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,880
different groups different applications

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,220
tying it all together and really helping

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,310
them focus on answering the big

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,700
questions so what is it about large

00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,560
enterprises what what what do you see

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,750
that they have the big aha moment like

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,960
that they need to do something different

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,880
what is what is that I think with a lot

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,350
of business it comes down to cost and

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,690
profit you know what's going to get them

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,400
new environments new use cases what's

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,470
going to help them find a competitive

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,300
find a new product understand their

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,770
customer better so they sound like

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,860
motherhood and apple pie but they're

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,389
very much the the key to big business is

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,660
finding the way to do that profitably so

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,949
cloud is a driver for that for some

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,180
environments like I said temporary

00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,910
workloads that Center it can be way more

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,430
cost-effective if you can synthesize it

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,960
not rebuild the silos etc so looking at

00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:03,729
the economics I think is at the end of

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,340
the day uh-huh where everybody needs to

00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,080
go I mean big data until you you know

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,979
made things a lot less expensive than

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,870
traditional data warehousing

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,370
environments but now it's also

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,680
increasing the scale of things

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,570
increasing the complexity because you're

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,070
trying to solve more complex problems

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,440
together so I think that's kind of their

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,030
aha moment is not only what could we do

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,460
but what can we do and how can we do

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:27,010
most cost-effectively so Nick if you and

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,039
I sit down 12 months from now what would

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,380
you like to see change for your your

00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,690
role with cloud era and how you guys

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,550
interface with the market I think we

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,080
have three main goals as we look at

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,699
approach in this part of the market we

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,830
want to make it easy for customers the

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,240
easier it is to get on board to get to

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,099
answers to get to solutions

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,870
obviously then there'll be more customer

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,280
adoption and then will those be solving

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,360
important problems for their business

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,490
making the world a better place

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,280
want to see it be really unified we'd

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,900
like to have one source of data and then

00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,000
bring your applications do that make

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,120
that really easy don't break into silos

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,190
and and make it again common and

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,599
standard and then we want to make it

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,710
enterprise grade we want to make sure

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,990
we're preserving the security

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,840
information the governance information

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,580
all the management capabilities that you

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,169
might have traditionally on-premise make

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,750
sure that exists in a cloud world as

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,340
well and that people access their data

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,840
safely and appropriately as they go

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,190
excellent Nick we look forward to that

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,190
journey with great thank you very much

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,469
