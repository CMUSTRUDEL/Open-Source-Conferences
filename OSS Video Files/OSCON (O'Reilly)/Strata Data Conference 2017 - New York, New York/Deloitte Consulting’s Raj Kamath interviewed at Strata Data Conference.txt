so Raj once a company as an executive

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,040
buy and once you've got that middle

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,050
people all deciding we're moving forward

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,100
with data and we're going to make better

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,380
decisions based on data

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,440
how do you actually build that stack how

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,050
does someone put together here's where

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,690
we're going that journey that roadmap to

00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,520
start using data so from a technology

00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,529
perspective there are a lot of things to

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,900
consider the important thing is to know

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,970
the big picture up front build out the

00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,379
data strategy and platform and a

00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,700
Technology Strategy upfront which

00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:35,200
training informs all of the

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,570
decision-making that you do at different

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,940
nodes of the stack one of the key things

00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,350
that we try to do is when we make those

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,449
decisions we are trying to bring the

00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,269
best of green technologies together at

00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:48,699
the same time we are looking at what

00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:50,350
works best for a specific situation no

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,269
two clients are the same no two

00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,070
situations are the same no two use cases

00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:56,800
are the same right they'll have broad

00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,110
brushstrokes which are common but the

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,900
nuances are what matters and that's

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:03,250
where when you put a technology

00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,110
architecture together and you started

00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,850
creating a solution you have to be open

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,130
to the fact that you have to integrate a

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,470
multitude of technologies from different

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,420
vendors that address the problem at hand

00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,970
so when you're stitching that together

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,440
that platform

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,460
do you ever have to make special

00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,980
connections to make them work together

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,400
or is it just pop the shelf and it works

00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:28,320
from multiple vendors it's a mix of both

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,670
there are some vendors where straight

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,500
out of the box because there are

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,720
engineering synergies that a lot of

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,880
these windows have with each other they

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,860
happen to be in each other's ecosystem

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,690
and development plants and those

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,700
products come together on the seamlessly

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,830
there are other vendors who are a

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,980
perfect fit for what the client wants to

00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,810
do but it requires some level of

00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,120
engineering effort from a side

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,280
perspective in order to make the two

00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,010
tools talk to each other right and what

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,840
you've seen is there's a general trend

00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,610
towards open source as well right

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,620
because the velocity of development in

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,060
in the open source community there are a

00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,680
lot of clients who want to get the best

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
of what the open source community has to

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,840
offer not just commercial vendors and

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,960
that's where you know the ability to

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,520
bridge the cots products with open

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,460
source projects bring it all together

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,610
and then deliver data asset or data

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,400
outcome that somebody could use is very

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,069
special so is this this sort of approach

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,849
ot

00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:32,299
hybrid between open and proprietary some

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,970
maybe custom code piled in this at the

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:37,430
north in industry today that is

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,409
definitely where people tend to go

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,909
regardless of wherever the journey has

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,799
started they may have started off with a

00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,640
homogeneous stack they may have started

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,930
off for the other end of the spectrum

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,120
where they try to do something purely

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,739
open source at the end of the day that

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,140
there's converted source and middle will

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,760
becomes a mix of both whether it's a

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,650
migration or you stew it at the start of

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,739
the journey really is informed by how

00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,599
much of planning did he do upfront in

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,849
order to lay out that that strategy that

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,980
decision-making framework really is the

00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,230
key to it and so you guys help with that

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,389
upfront planning so all throughout the

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,609
process you're helping them figure out

00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,200
what their data journey is gonna be and

00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:15,230
what outcomes they're looking for

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,239
exactly and and it's it's also an

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,430
evolution right because you'd see that

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,500
what you know today it's probably not

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,030
going to be a priority for you year and

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,370
a half two years down the line so as you

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,129
go through that journey what you really

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:30,859
think about is what's current right now

00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:32,900
from a top mine issues perspective for a

00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,519
client and what do I need to do to go

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,169
back to that roadmap that I built out

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,970
and refresh that and make it relevant

00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,609
for what's happening now right make it

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:42,470
evolve it's a living living reading the

00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:44,359
architecture it's not something which is

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,829
certain stone on day one and then you

00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:48,590
keep executing for 3-4 years

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:52,250
so Raj last question from me

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:55,910
do you hear a standard we want to use X

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,739
like an X being spark or to do or do you

00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,569
hear a lot of enterprise customers that

00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,660
have a requirement that they want to

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:06,019
start doing X Y or Z and what is X Y or

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,830
Z what is the number one light we want

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,590
to do to do or what is it it's a great

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,560
question and typically I think there's a

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,840
strong sway related to the conferences

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,250
such as this that occur I'm pretty sure

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,600
my clients will be asking a lot about

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,669
machine learning and artificial

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,190
intelligence coming out of this yeah

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,620
exactly so so it really depends on what

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,229
the buzzwords are that that tends to

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,660
ignite the conversation the next thing

00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:35,090
to really have a dialogue about is where

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,950
are we in our overall analytic study

00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,260
where are we in our overall data journey

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,419
and then realize that if that is the

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,940
aspiration what does it take for us to

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:46,160
go from here to there right and make it

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,870
happen in a very deliberate fashion such

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,449
that your chances of success are

00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,449
elevated excellent Raj thank you for

00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,509
your time again

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,509
