hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,730
data in New York City I'm here with Zia

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,069
MA from Intel see how you doing I'm

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,440
great thank you Mike so when my friends

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,580
ask me who is who are the leaders in

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,060
data and AI and I come out with Intel

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,130
and Amazon and Google and others like

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,090
IBM and Microsoft are in the game as

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,500
well they always say Intel and because

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,080
they know what you guys has a chip maker

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,240
so can you explain how you guys have

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,399
such a good headstart on everyone else

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,489
in the data world and that AI world

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,040
definitely I guess so you know an Intel

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,050
has been so well known for his hardware

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,050
technology is that perception that Intel

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,180
is a top Hardware leader is so strong

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,110
over the years but it really over the

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,760
last few years

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,370
Intel has been going through this

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,710
transformation and even you know in the

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,539
earlier talks our CEO Brian krzanich has

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,270
been talking about Intel being a data

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,550
company I mean using analytics and AI as

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,100
example we don't just offer Hardware

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,939
technologies obviously you know we the

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,430
for hardware we offer general purpose

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,500
like Xeon and Xeon Phi and we also offer

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,250
targeted silicon such as FPGA and

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,380
anumana but on top of that we deliver

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,729
fully optimize the software stack from

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,549
libraries and frameworks to tools and

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:26,490
solutions because our goal is to enable

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,009
the best analytics and AI experience for

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,030
our customers not just the hardware is

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,670
it really hardware and a software

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,409
combined together so you optimize for

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,329
that then because you know obviously you

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,670
know how your chips are made you can

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,520
optimize how your software runs on those

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,759
chips so if someone was to build a

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
system would they start with at the chip

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,670
level and then use your software all the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,659
way through the system they're trying to

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,439
build it's a it's a face recognition

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:58,979
application for use in detecting you

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,049
know kids that may be stolen on the on

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,850
the black market or whatever so could

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,250
you doing something like that in real

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,890
time is Intel the where to start

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:11,880
is it the chip level where you start yes

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:15,120
yes so actually the intel has done a cup

00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,760
of customer use cases for facial

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,510
detection we offer you know we aren't

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,040
actually for end-to-end view analytics

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,830
like the you can use case you just

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,690
described it we not only offer the the

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,620
back end silver hardware we also offer

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,090
the client hardware and then on top of

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,280
that we run

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,010
you know Intel math kernal library for

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,840
optimizing your performance and also we

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,590
run the different like machine learning

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,590
and inference SDKs that Intel offer so

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,690
that you can easily build your analytics

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,680
or AI solutions on top of that so pretty

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:56,670
much we're focusing on end to end from

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:59,040
client to server and also from hardware

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,900
to software solution stack for our

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,940
customers because I will go at the end

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,890
is to solve customers problem in a very

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,480
simple and a performant way I always

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,700
equate Intel with performance and

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,239
optimization like you make things run

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,400
faster and better so if someone chooses

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,450
to go with like Xeon your your new

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,160
announcements this week

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,530
does that give them an inherent

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,470
advantage because of the speed of

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,470
processing yes actually that's one of

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,959
the biggest advantages that our newly

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,450
along announced as the unscalable family

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,280
has and this is the the biggest a

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,269
platform advancement that we have in a

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,269
decade

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,940
so Hadoop and spark for example the

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:45,060
optimized on Xeon stack shows three

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,640
times performance over the previously on

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,820
generation four Antoine a big bunch of

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,130
workloads and then for decision for

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,549
decision support workloads it's showing

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,860
2.7 times performance and even for micro

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:02,549
benchmarks like high bench workloads

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,040
it's showing 93 percent performance

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,720
improvement so definitely you you will

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,430
enjoy the significant performance

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,090
improvement out of that this new

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,680
processor and so for applications that

00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,480
are

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,160
dependent on real-time and streaming

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,630
data and things like that

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,660
they're gonna get a much better

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,250
experience by having the Xeon layer

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,770
underneath definitely a much more

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,020
responsiveness from the new Xeon silver

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,030
and is that where we want to go in the

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,310
future I mean you know like Moore's Law

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,220
how much quicker can you guys get and

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,610
you know yeah so the most I you know

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,710
most law is still live and it you know

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,199
Intel is committed we have a proven

00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,990
track record there is Moore's law and I

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,610
will continue with that and you know

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,770
this is why we successfully this year

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:53,150
launched is a on scalable family so but

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,270
definitely we're not just limiting

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,440
ourselves to hardware itself is really

00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,449
the total hardware and software

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,430
solutions to optimizing the whole stack

00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,760
optimizing the whole solution stack

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:07,460
right just like for the analytics and

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,770
recently we pushed out big dl you know

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:15,020
that's one of the new why is that a big

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,449
deal it is a big deal because many of

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,449
our customers they already have their

00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:23,419
analytics pipeline running on Xeon

00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:25,910
cluster so they have the the entire

00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:28,190
pipeline from data ingest to data

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,080
processing data management feature

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,080
extraction even to traditional machine

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,750
learning so many of them were asking a

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,539
question whether I have to go to a

00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:40,940
different cluster to train my model and

00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:44,419
then bring the model back to my existing

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,599
analytics pipeline or if there is a

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:49,280
simple way just for me to the Builder

00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,349
machine learning capability learning

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,229
capability on my existing analytics

00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:57,349
pipeline that's exactly the reason and

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:59,030
why we created a big deal because you

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,250
can just launch it directly from your

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,849
Hadoop or spark cluster and with your

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,560
existing analytics pipeline so doing it

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:09,199
in place rather than round-tripping or

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,180
going back and forth exactly and also I

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,680
I think are now the biggest benefit for

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,020
the customer is that you don't have to

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,330
purchase a brand new cluster that's a

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,940
lot of cost actually for customer you

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,590
can leverage your existing

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,659
infrastructure and build this deep

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,550
learning and is well integrated with the

00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,180
existing infrastructure and a software

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,150
solution

00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,190
now do you have so I look at at what's

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,050
going on in data and AI and machine

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,910
learning and deep learning and all the

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,509
different technologies together as

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,009
having two main purposes one's either

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:43,220
big businesses are trying to transform

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:45,740
and they're trying to stay ahead of the

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,740
disruptors who are the other segments

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,100
there's transformers and disruptors you

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,900
work with both sets on both sides what

00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:57,259
do you see happening in the next 12

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,660
months on the disruption front and the

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,789
transformation front are big enterprises

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,169
going to transform well and our

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:09,919
disruptors going to come up even more I

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:12,740
think for the next 12 months or 18

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,220
months also analytics an AI we'll keep

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,940
evolving and and we're seeing especially

00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,479
you know cloud service providers

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,910
adopting the AI solutions and adopting

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,849
analytics at a very fast pace that will

00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,340
definitely continue and also we will see

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,870
enterprise segment the you know

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,690
enterprise and a government a segment

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,030
will start benefiting it also from this

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,460
from this offering actually in recent

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:44,810
engagement intel has we're seeing comms

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:47,479
customers they're looking to taking

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,270
advantage of AI and analytics solutions

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,659
to help improve their business result

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:56,780
and Finance result so yes so definitely

00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,220
we will see you know AI analytics will

00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,599
continue with no momentum but it is

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,400
going to be applied to more than just

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,229
one vertical segment it will and

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,630
financial services actually we see

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:08,630
another big trend with financial

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,979
services using analytics and AI and you

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,909
guys work with pretty much everyone

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:13,699
you're you're almost like the

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:15,320
Switzerland of technology or you work

00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,150
with all different partners that's

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,400
exactly our goal we want to make sure

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,070
the you know different business segments

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,599
were able to take advantage and are able

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,909
to continue to take advantage of our

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,909
hardware and software optimize the

00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:30,470
solutions on Intel Architecture

00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:31,820
excellent we'll see we look forward to

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,959
the next 12 to 18 months with you guys

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,959
oh thank you thank you

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,370
