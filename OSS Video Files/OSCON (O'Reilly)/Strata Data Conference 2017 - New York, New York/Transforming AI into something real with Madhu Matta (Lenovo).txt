hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,640
data in New York City

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,830
I'm here with Madhu Matta how you doing

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,230
and then okay you're with Lenovo yes

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,230
what do you do with Lenovo so I've been

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,210
very fortunate enough to lead the

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,980
relatively new segment of artificial

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,690
intelligence inside Lenovo but I also

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,160
lead the high-performance computing

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,570
group where we're doing very well and

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,550
there's a very close relationship

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,160
between high performance computing and

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,930
AI therefore I get to lead both segments

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,910
so which tease that apart a little bit

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,670
you're in the AI and the performance

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,590
group performance processing power can

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,190
you explain the difference between those

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,420
sure so when we talk about performance

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,950
there's different thresholds for

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,539
performance and there's a price

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,450
associated with the different thresholds

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,059
of performance now processing is just

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,010
straight-up processing you can have

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,440
processing that you set metrics for very

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,570
high performance of that specific set of

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,079
processing for a specific task or you

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,989
could say I have a lot longer time to do

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,030
that processing therefore I don't need

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,409
to pay for that higher performance

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,260
therefore I go with the lower

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,700
performance because one the workload or

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,130
tasks required doesn't require that

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,320
level of performance or does so it's

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,820
it's a price performance game that you

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,040
know customers always try to play with

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,530
it's it's optimizing your task or your

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,119
workload to either higher performance or

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,799
lower performance and end there's always

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,829
a price performance trade-off okay

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,829
trade-off that you make yes so what is

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,150
lenovo's interest in AI what I mean what

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,770
do you guys can yeah so you know

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,740
everywhere you go

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,560
AI is now the the latest hottest

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,420
buzzword out there and you know I think

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,670
all of us in the business want to turn

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,490
that buzzword into something real AI has

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,070
the potential to completely change the

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,869
way we interact with the world around us

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,600
the things around us the objects around

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,030
us including a lot of benefits around

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,799
how we interact with ourselves change

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,689
the way or change the way we run our

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,119
lives change our lifestyles get more

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,770
healthy so there's there's a million

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,740
applications today and there's many more

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,659
million that haven't been

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,709
invented yet so AI is the next big

00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:13,959
frontier from a technology perspective

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,790
Lenovo is a global company with about

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:18,430
forty three billion dollars in revenue

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,260
we have one of the few companies on the

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,150
planet that have an end-to-end set of

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,580
assets that can actually deliver to a

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,470
customer a full experience and buy into

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,870
and what I mean is you start with the

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,030
edge devices such as mobile devices move

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,340
to personal computing devices with our

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:35,980
PC group we have our mobile division and

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,630
and eventually end up where the data is

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,180
crunched which is the data center side

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,830
so he have assets across all three and

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,350
the number was made up of essentially

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,180
three major divisions the mobile group

00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,220
the personal computing group and the

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,650
data center group so to a customer it's

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,690
a one-stop shop for pretty much any

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,090
solution out there technology wise and

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,940
AI is the next frontier we want to lead

00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,440
that space so an AI is evident in all

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,870
three of those different that is correct

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,400
we to the customer the customer doesn't

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,739
want to put the P spots together

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,530
oh yeah it's hard everybody knows the

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:10,239
benefits but our goal is to bring our

00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,390
assets to go to deliver an end to an

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,329
experience to a customer so we know how

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,299
hard where I have pretty much we

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,820
understand you guys is having a big

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:25,510
hardware background

00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,340
ai is pretty much software it's both but

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:31,690
yeah so yeah you so you're building this

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,670
this end-to-end yes with a layers on top

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:36,549
of it exactly right and how are they

00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,750
layered together as well so if we go

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:42,760
back to the core steps in AI it starts

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,850
we start at the workload for us the idea

00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,250
is to essentially provide plug-and-play

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,160
simplicity for AI deployments to

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,870
customers who have no exposure to AI but

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,850
understand the benefits but just don't

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,060
know where to start which by the way

00:03:54,850 --> 00:04:01,359
that probably describes a lot 95% of the

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,100
customers out there but the one thing

00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,459
that's common with most of these

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,859
customers is they have I'm gonna use a

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,200
term here that's starting to catch on

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,000
fire which is data Lake they have lakes

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,769
and lakes and lakes of data other words

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,870
petabytes and petabytes in some cases

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,100
zettabytes of data now what do you do

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,400
with this data you know there is it some

00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,260
it's a minefield of gold nuggets how do

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,470
you parse out those nuggets that can

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,880
benefit your corporation so what we plan

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:30,410
to do here is from a strategy

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,350
perspective is to deliver plug-and-play

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,390
simplicity to these customers or to any

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,190
customer out there and we will stand up

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:39,200
the workload we are actually developing

00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,290
our own workloads in this space for

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,400
example health workloads that will help

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:49,100
detect cancer in terms of classifying

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,170
whether in a specific location is there

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,790
cancer or is it not and then move on to

00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,340
more advanced steps of what sort of

00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,800
cancer now we believe that with these

00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,950
applications and the infrastructure

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,410
underneath it we can actually drive the

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,750
error rate of human doing the same job

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,630
versus a machine learning doing the same

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,570
job by about 85% it's it's it's an 85

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,920
percent better in terms of error rate

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,140
against in case what a human can do

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,900
today so the goal here used to start up

00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:21,200
the workload in build an infrastructure

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,790
all the way down to AI specific hardware

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,460
since you talked about as a hardware

00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,050
company and in between we use a lot of

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,300
open source layers that are out there

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,800
today the deep neural network frameworks

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,450
that are out there the most common

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,810
frameworks but as which Stitch the soft

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,640
stack between the workload and the

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,920
hardware tier we are going to be

00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,620
differentiating in certain tiers of that

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,740
software stack using open source tools

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,680
to enable very quick deployment and very

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,930
fast resource scheduling and a GUI that

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,360
will actually provide templates so that

00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,010
for for many popular workloads so that a

00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,420
customer can actually deploy these

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,880
workloads very quickly with those

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,460
templates so in the world today it seems

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,730
like there's two main camps I think and

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,650
and they're trying to grapple with AI

00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,800
there's the large companies that are in

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,690
what they call it transformation IT

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,640
transformation digital transformation

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,740
whatever sort of transformation we want

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,600
to call it and they're doing that to not

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,430
be disrupted and that's the other camp

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,980
the disruptors the ones that want to

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,770
take over market share in large areas

00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,880
and become the next over or whatever you

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,130
know whatever it is they're going after

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,380
how do you guys work with

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,850
the emerging markets the disruptors and

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,650
how do you work with the large

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,840
enterprise companies the ones that are

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,150
slow but trying to transition and

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,870
transform so I think I think with the

00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,610
disruptors stories like providing an

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,300
end-to-end solution on here I actually

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,880
is incredibly attractive to them because

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,160
we all believe together that AI is going

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,200
to give you that edge especially in

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,120
terms of chatbot application that tells

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,180
you your customer sentiment your product

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,820
sentiment and the the smaller more

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,310
nimble guys are hungry for that data to

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,930
quickly move and change their either

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,150
their roadmaps or the way they deal with

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,010
customers is just one example to quickly

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,110
change to come up from underneath the

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,880
larger cost larger enterprise customers

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,240
who are slower in this space to react

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,010
but I mean we want to take the story so

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,510
that it's an equal playing field across

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,460
the board right whether it's a large

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,190
customer or small customer here are a

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,560
set of tools or you can easily deploy to

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,390
completely disrupt the way you do your

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,250
business and also protect against

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,350
disruption from the outside who are not

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,300
quite quick to get there so I'm gonna do

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,450
if we sat down twelve months from now

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,150
and we have this conversation what would

00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:47,090
you like to say Lenovo is doing

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,590
different 12 months from now and what

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,140
would you like to see being done

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,750
differently in the market in general so

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,150
the first answer is a little simpler we

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,660
have very clear goals 12 months from now

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,330
I want to be standing up here saying the

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,950
world is recognized that with what we

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,630
bring to the market especially in our

00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,580
high-performance computing our

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,490
supercomputing space and our AI tools

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,650
that we are leading the charge and

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,290
providing the end to an infrastructure

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,370
for very large research institutions and

00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:22,250
customers like them who are driving

00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:24,650
solutions or cures for major issue major

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,060
problems such as cancer we want to be

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,770
the ones that are driving that

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,990
infrastructure underneath that driving

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,550
this research and driving the powers and

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,979
the performance behind this kind of

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,289
research that's one piece we want to

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,090
lead in three segments that we have

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,690
publicly put out there as our core

00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:43,040
target segments academia and research

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,870
healthcare and manufacturing versus

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,270
trying to go after the

00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,520
boiling the ocean concept we want to

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,440
focus so 12 months from now I'd be very

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,260
happy and I hope to stand up here and

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,360
say Mike we we said we we are we want to

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,900
lead we are leading these three segments

00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,610
in terms of the industry I think what we

00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,430
all need to come together as industry

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,620
and say look we know this technology is

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,320
going to change the way human beings

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,790
live our longevity the way we interact

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,220
with things how can we come together

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,730
build a set of standards and make it

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,860
together simple for the average small

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,779
customer on the street to have access to

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,250
this level of technology so that makes

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:23,900
their lives easier makes them a lot more

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,010
productive excellent and I do we look

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,120
forward to that conversation thank you

00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,120
so much Mike thanks for your time

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,890
