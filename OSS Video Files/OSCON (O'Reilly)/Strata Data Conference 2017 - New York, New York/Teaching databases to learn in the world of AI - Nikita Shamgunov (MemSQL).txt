Title: Teaching databases to learn in the world of AI - Nikita Shamgunov (MemSQL)
Publication date: 2017-09-27
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Todayâ€™s AI applications can sense and respond to human interactions. Personalization, image recognition, and recommendation engines require adaptable applications to drive value. AI applications need to adapt faster with databases that learn and respond in real time. Nikita Shamgunov discusses the future of databases for fast-learning adaptable applications.

This keynote is sponsored by MemSQL.

	00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:10,379
good morning I'm the CEO of M sequel and

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,709
today I'm going to talk about what

00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:17,039
happens if you teach databases to learn

00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:18,990
in the world of AI well before we talk

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,960
about databases let's talk about

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,490
applications and today we're pushing the

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:31,129
limits to make applications more human

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:35,190
they're visual they're intelligent and

00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:36,749
adaptable and early in my career I

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,960
worked on the back-end infrastructure

00:00:36,749 --> 00:00:43,109
Huang the most popular data applications

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,539
in the world and I know firsthand how

00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:48,600
the how much complexity that

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:53,010
infrastructure entails the typical

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:57,210
pillars of that infrastructure are today

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,460
lake data science infrastructure and the

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,159
data base so let me tell you what

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,930
happens if you start teaching databases

00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:09,079
to learn and you build a simple

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:13,680
real-time and scalable and adaptable

00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:17,130
database so why it's simple well in fact

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,829
only simple things scale and once you

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,350
have a simple reliable transactional

00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,890
database it lets you consolidate a lot

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,649
of tears in your infrastructure close

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,439
operational gaps if you can start

00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:33,090
processing your data in real time you

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,149
can start doing things like score

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,960
machine learning models and ingest you

00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,969
can on live queries on fresh data and it

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,009
because the system is scaleable it also

00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:48,329
gives you extreme performance and

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,270
finally adaptable not only it can run

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,890
transactions and analytics it can start

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,670
exhibiting learn behavior and make

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,189
decisions on your behalf

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,609
so last Radha in San Jose we already

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,609
talked what we can do with scoring

00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:08,270
tensorflow models in real time and how

00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,680
we can find missing children by

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,670
collaborating with a nonprofit called

00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,900
thorn since six months later our

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,599
customers built-in

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,329
credible applications so that's pause

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,010
for the second here we're taking a

00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:29,549
picture of you know a camera or a

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:31,470
sunglasses and a simple query that's

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,709
hitting the database in real time and

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,109
power and application can in a matter of

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:42,900
milliseconds identify that object and

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:45,720
find it in the database so databases are

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,420
cool but they're only as cool as if they

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,090
fit into your infrastructure and in then

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,730
sequel we want to integrate with pretty

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,389
much everything now for this audience

00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:01,049
what matters is integrations with Hadoop

00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:03,870
spark and Kafka so a lot of our

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,939
customers use mem sequel alongside with

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,870
Hadoop where you can have a reference

00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,790
data store in HDFS and very efficiently

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,670
move data into mem sequel to start

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,780
powering your applications you can also

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,449
use it with spark and consume data using

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,519
spark streaming and in parallel with

00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:25,410
extremely high throughput push it into

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,810
mem sequel again to power your

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,669
applications if you want to learn more

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,799
about it there's a session coming up

00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:34,099
that's called exploring real time

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,400
capabilities with spark sequel and

00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,919
finally which is very exciting for us is

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,159
integrations with kafka so now you can

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:47,879
directly stream data from Kafka into mmm

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,250
sequel at gigabytes per second and then

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,290
get this data available to you

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,569
immediately to power your applications

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,650
if you want to learn more about

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,359
streaming from kafka there's another

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,500
session coming up in this conference

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:05,459
that's called building real-time

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,470
feedback loop for education and the one

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,540
thought I want to leave you with is we

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,510
know that AI is going to be everywhere

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,500
and we're starting to get used to AI in

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:19,320
applications but in fact it's also gonna

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,659
do really really good stuff in systems

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,479
and infrastructure and what it means for

00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:27,120
databases that AI will start making

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,879
decisions in your behalf on data

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,119
distribution what index is to use

00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:35,909
what knobs to turn and give you very

00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:38,909
simple to use automatically tunable

00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:41,099
database and that is the future that

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:45,839
we're moving towards annum can be more

00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:47,310
excited to see AI in databases thank you

00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,769
so much

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,769
[Applause]

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,490
