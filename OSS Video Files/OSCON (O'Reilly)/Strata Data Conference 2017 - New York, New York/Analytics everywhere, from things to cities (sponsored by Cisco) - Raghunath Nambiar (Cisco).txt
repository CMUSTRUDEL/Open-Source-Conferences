let's talk about digitization new

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,160
opportunities and how it will change our

00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,440
lives in a positive way industry

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,749
landscape is changing quickly no

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,390
surprise to this crowd

00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:19,580
but unlike historically today access to

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,820
technologies are becoming more and more

00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,000
universal for example smartphones

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,730
introduced just ten years ago it is

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,050
everywhere it is changing the way we

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:36,140
connect communicate and collaborate next

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,039
decade of opportunities will be around

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:43,789
connecting the unconnected we have come

00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,739
across a long way today there are 25

00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:48,949
billion devices connected the Internet

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:52,190
by 2020 50 billion devices will be

00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:53,839
connected to the Internet by 2030 you

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,059
are talking about half a trillion

00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:02,539
connected devices let's click on 20 26

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,059
billion smart smart phones 220 million

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,299
connected cars 80 percent of the world

00:01:05,059 --> 00:01:10,909
population will be connected when you

00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:13,969
connect and connected unconnected the

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:16,759
possibilities are endless let's look at

00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:19,399
the some of the verticals education for

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,189
example imagine the possibility when

00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:26,390
every student in the world having access

00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:28,159
to a Khan Academy YouTube connected

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,850
health is going to transform the

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,640
healthcare industry smart metering and

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,979
smart grids will transform the energy

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,140
sector industry for daughter is already

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,350
transformed transforming manufacturing

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,039
sector uber-like innovations in

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:48,380
transportation possibilities are endless

00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:51,140
let's look at cities many of us live in

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,799
the many of us live in cities

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:58,880
some of us live in mega cities today

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,609
there are 32 mega cities by 2030 you are

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,409
talking about 41 mega cities and six

00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:10,950
hundred sixty two cities with a

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:14,100
population of over 1 million by 2030

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:18,030
the urban population will cross five

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:21,030
billion cities offers tremendous

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:26,190
opportunities in education employment

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,590
and health care but there is a price for

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,090
it

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:35,310
75% of the world's resources are

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:37,590
consumed by cities there are several

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,190
areas of improvement making the cities

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,950
cleaner safer efficient and sustainable

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,500
basically make them smart cities when

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,130
you think about smart cities this is the

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:54,150
dream everything is perfect but the

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,660
reality is this transforming a city is a

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,019
major undertaking let me take you to a

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:05,070
country that is committed to smart

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:07,260
cities in a big way India when you talk

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,150
about India this may be the perception

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,120
especially if you have learned about

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,540
India from National Geographic magazine

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,180
the land of elephants tigers snake

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,829
charmers Yogi's and the holy they were

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,930
all or all true all true but today it is

00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,360
the largest democracy in the world there

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,910
are more internet users in India than

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,160
the population of the u.s. there are 400

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,950
million smartphone users there are six

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,799
mega cities one-fifth of all the mega

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,579
cities there are five hundred cities and

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,790
there are 98 smart city initiatives in

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,709
India Cisco is a proud partner and we

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,790
are working very closely with the

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:53,670
Government of India so each one of the

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,370
cities have a interesting and unique

00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:00,060
story to tell let me take you to one of

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,220
those cities Jaipur it's one of the most

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,680
beautiful cities in the world also

Hadoop that is analytics that is deep

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,090
learning that is machine learning come

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,300
