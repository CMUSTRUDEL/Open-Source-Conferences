hi this is Mike Hendrickson in New York

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,819
City with Chuck Norris I'm here at

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,259
strata data how you doing great okay

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,750
good to be your mic so it's been a while

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:13,049
since we talked and what has changed in

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:15,080
the world with Matt Barr well we have

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,520
been making a series of announcements

00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,500
the grand total is really to support

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,470
companies with an underlying data fabric

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,289
and allow them to leverage all of their

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,029
data and to really take analytics and

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,029
move it from a historical perspective to

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,340
inject it into the business to impact it

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,899
as it's happening and yesterday we made

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,480
a significant announcement from the

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,000
database aspect of that and the database

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,579
announcement is that bringing things

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,340
together what is it actually doing yeah

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,690
if you look at if you look at database

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,480
and scaling there's I think around 400

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:55,320
different database tools out there that

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,629
a developer could select from and they

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,000
typically look at the workloads and say

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,170
well you know what's the few candidates

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,539
that I have it kind of meet that

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,920
specific workloads and we're changing

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,659
all that by converging both the kind of

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,100
transactional with the analytics so the

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,080
high Reed intensive and the hi-brite

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,520
intensive together for the same

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,049
application or for a group of

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,720
applications running on top of that

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,939
fabric so a lot of features in terms of

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,220
how you support those analytics with

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,310
sequel with in place machine learning a

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,590
lot of focus on the API to allow it

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,270
easier for developers to to develop

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,460
applications that take advantage of that

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,070
and then to focus the real-time feeds

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,290
both in terms of integrated into streams

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,180
and then for for global change data

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,400
capture so really significant so for

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,280
developers who want to deploy real-time

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,490
AI type applications this is going to be

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,259
really stood yeah this and and I'll put

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,880
a little copy out there because even you

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,860
kind of said for analytic type of

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,540
applications we're used to bucketing

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,240
we're used to saying well this is just a

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,119
piece right and I think we're we're just

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,040
the next generation whether you call

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,829
them intelligent application cognitive

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,129
applications it's look I'm trying to I'm

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,690
trying to drive my my web presence well

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,910
part of the web presence is how do i

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,710
contextual eyes that for each

00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:16,660
individual right how do I make it

00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,150
appropriate so I think we'll start

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,160
talking about speed we'll start talking

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,560
about context and we'll start talking

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,360
about action because it's really those

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,250
three dimensions that allow you to

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,290
leverage your data so it's not who's got

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,750
the most data that's wins it's who can

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,940
understand the context that that data

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,950
provides so that they can make the the

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,100
best business action are there any any

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,680
scale scaling issues with a database

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,570
like this I mean yeah does it run on

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,610
premises run in the cloud does it run

00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,740
everywhere so the best answer is yes

00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,270
right you want to be able to run across

00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,950
location so you want to run all the way

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,240
to the edge right and that's what we've

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,640
architected for and usually what you

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:01,000
have is okay I need I need availability

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,070
and I need speed and I need reliability

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,560
pick any two right so eventual

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,930
consistency models is basically the

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,390
de-facto standard we challenged all that

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,520
with how to deliver strong consistency

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,980
and performance and scale at the same

00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,500
time so and we don't do trade-offs

00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,500
unavailability so that's the building

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,870
block for the underlying core database

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,610
and that's what's significant and we're

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,350
getting just huge response with this

00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,410
announcement and so and another

00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,959
application of this is in the darling of

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,110
the data world right now seems to be the

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,180
machine learning deep learning and AI

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,830
application and to me it seems like

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,380
that's gonna work better with more

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:45,100
real-time streaming data feeding those

00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,959
yeah absolutely it's but it's not just

00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,790
the streaming aspect again we're kind of

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:54,100
used to compartmentalizing right that

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,720
goes back into the CEP days right if you

00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,160
look at the machine learning huge

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:02,050
advances and just constant changes and

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,239
you know internally one of our data

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,850
Sciences refers to it as the you know

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,450
machine learning tool of the Month Club

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:12,610
yeah but Ted Dunning just Ted and Ellen

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:16,090
Friedman just published a new O'Reilly

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,730
book series on data modeling and machine

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,640
learning and in it they they have this

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:24,100
whole chapter devoted to 90% of success

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,360
is based on the data logistics so it's

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,830
not just which tool you use but

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,930
how do you get the data there how do you

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,699
have the constant training how do you

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,289
have the context the historical data

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,180
side by side with the data that's

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,800
streaming in and the the other data

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,599
that's providing you no additional

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,900
information additional context if you

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:43,909
will it's all of that working together

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,069
that that is in real-time to allow you

00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:48,560
to act quickly so it's not machine

00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:50,419
learning that is a better analytic to

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,699
explain the past it's a machine learning

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:55,520
it's better analytic to decide what to

00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,409
do now so data still is very very

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,789
important in this whole yeah this whole

00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,650
way it's the yeah it's the building

00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:02,810
block gets to the new level if you will

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,210
yeah it's not the new new oil there was

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:09,349
something else that was training data

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:11,180
right yeah okay so if you look at where

00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:14,150
we have come in the last six months

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,740
right I mean it's you guys have a new

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,680
database that's doing things together

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,889
you know there is a lot of change going

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,000
on how quickly are we going to get to a

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:29,210
point to where AI is pervasive and and

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,159
yet transparent like it doesn't affect

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,440
you it's just like guiding us through

00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:36,589
the world yeah we years off from that

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,629
sort of thing I think what we're we're

00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:42,680
in the midst of is this is this paradigm

00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:44,569
shift and the old model was we're

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,699
talking about an application and a

00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:48,770
technology and that was dictating the

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:51,139
data underneath to make that run and

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,300
that's how you optimize things and what

00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:56,509
it resulted was in a series of separate

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,520
silos and in the Big Data space you know

00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,529
we were using big data as kind of a

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,779
descriptor but it kind of stood for a

00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:05,539
certain group of technologies right and

00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,050
those resulted in a series of separate

00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,240
silos

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,219
well that database doesn't run on that

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,020
you'll have to have a separate cluster

00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:14,360
there and that database you know will

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,219
you need a more analytic one so that'll

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,409
be a separate one here anything from

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:20,659
that separate stream right the feeds all

00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:23,479
that so we've kind of repeated that and

00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,669
I I think organizations are starting to

00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,930
realize that what you need is to

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:32,629
separate out you need to have this very

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,990
flexible high performant reliable data

00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:37,909
layer a data fabric if you will and then

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,060
have the analytics brought to that in a

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:42,430
broad variety of Antal

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,620
that sit side-by-side with your kind of

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,460
legacy applications right that's the new

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,060
order

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:52,060
that's the to focus and the vision of a

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,850
bar was to architect from the beginning

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,260
to support this broad functionality this

00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,570
broad data fabric that's what we

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,490
continue to push on so the the database

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,030
announcement is in the context of this

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,490
broad data fabric that is cross location

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,490
that is cross data that's supports

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,860
multiple application multiple tenants

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,080
right so that you can logically carve it

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,400
out the way you need to so question I

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,040
haven't asked you in quite a while and

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,350
I'm curious because of how technology

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,350
has changed with data you know being

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:26,560
pervasive and somewhat better managed

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,810
now and better in control AI and machine

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,530
learning deep learning feeding off of

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,830
that data repository that we have what

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,419
in the world would you apply all these

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,870
technologies to to change something

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,850
better for humans you mean what what

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,150
yeah what K what application like what

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,520
space would you resource allocation or

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,940
you know different things what do you

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,060
think data could solve in the world that

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,410
we're not currently attacking it or

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:05,200
focusing it on well I think I think you

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:08,080
know data is really the the enabling

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,380
kind of input and important output from

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,900
a variety of functions and if you look

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,970
at how do you kind of put these more

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,240
closely together how do you kind of knit

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,820
a fabric out of those inputs and outputs

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,120
and some exhaust is the fuel for another

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:29,139
step the greater you can do that the the

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:33,940
more specific the information is whether

00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:37,229
that's for for that's medical and how do

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,490
we how do we better understand the right

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,200
medicine the right approaches for

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,029
individuals so understanding their

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,209
genetic makeup which means that this is

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:49,450
you know this is a very effective versus

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,370
you know deleterious application that's

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,930
that's that's huge that's very different

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,000
than you know the 80/20 and

00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,310
tested across a broad population say I'm

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,930
sorry it really was effective for this

00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:01,550
group but it doesn't work over here so

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,260
we can't approve it that's it that's

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,700
changing everything that's just one

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,050
small little piece and if you look

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:12,649
across security being able to understand

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,390
quickly a previous unknown so that you I

00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,010
know that that's a threat and being able

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,350
to have the forensics to decide how to

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,950
address it as quickly as possible makes

00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,290
everything more secure and and reduces

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,709
the the fraud and the leakage in it in a

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:30,709
system so I mean I could go on and on

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:32,930
yeah and it's really just better

00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,450
understanding better leverage of our

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,690
data is key to being more effective

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,750
across a broad swath of activities and I

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,060
think that's why you know the the the

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,790
new oil is a pretty interesting term

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,040
right because that works across you know

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,270
all these industrial functions right it

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,820
what makes this you know very

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:55,070
complicated machinery run that's what

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,070
we're talking about with with data and

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,430
having it flow faster having more of it

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,860
available having it closely interlink

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,600
those related activities so that they

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,209
can be more effective and have more

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,560
visibility that's all goodness excellent

00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:12,550
well Jack we look forward to that future

00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,550
thank you thanks Mike

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,589
