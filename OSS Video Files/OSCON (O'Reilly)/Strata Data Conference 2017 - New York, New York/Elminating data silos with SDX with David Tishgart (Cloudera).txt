hi this is Mike Henderson from strata

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,920
data in New York City I'm here with

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,200
David described David how you doing

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,550
doing all right how are you good so this

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,110
morning Michelson talked a little bit

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,660
about something you guys have just

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,700
announced SDX can you give us a little

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,550
more insights into what that is yeah

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,650
sure we're really excited about STX and

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,210
we did talk about it today but STX is

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,519
actually part of our core platform today

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,130
and we've got over a thousand customers

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,930
that are using it in production STX is

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,480
an acronym that stands for shared data

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,510
experience and what we're really trying

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,410
to do is give customers the ability to

00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:40,379
develop deploy multifunction

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,870
applications in a consistently secure

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,700
and governed manner so why that's

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,770
important is increasingly applications

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,180
are becoming more and more complex when

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,879
we see that we sail in a bunch of

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,510
keynotes today we saw the use cases from

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,270
preventative maintenance you know human

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,520
genomics robotics all of these

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,920
applications they use a ton of data

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,229
right and there's data that's moving all

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,200
over the place there is data that is

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,030
being used for you know there's data

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,240
engineering that takes place for ETL

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,890
there are analytics that go on there's

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,810
real-time operations

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,850
there's streaming data all of these

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,070
different applications in traditional

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,140
architectures they function in silos and

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,930
when you have data silos that means that

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,780
the data that resides in that silo has

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,369
its own schema has its own set of

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,210
security policies is own set of

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,369
governance so in order for you to really

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,220
create more of a platform effect where

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,930
you can have multiple applications

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,369
running against the same set of data you

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,159
kind of you really need to break down

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,049
those silos and that's what SDX does it

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,909
eliminates data silos and creates a

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,369
shared experience where multiple

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,409
analytic applications can run on a

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,079
shared set of data that's consistent

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,060
that has the same security and as the

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,070
same governance policies associated with

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,890
it in just jog rafi matter here I mean

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,899
can I have my silo in Beijing and my

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,860
silo and Rio and my silo in New York and

00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:09,569
SDX is going to bring that together

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,649
that's what's so exciting about SDX is

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,490
it really doesn't matter where your data

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,210
is this is all about

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,940
empowering everywhere anywhere data for

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,660
everyone really so you've got you can

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,520
have data stored up you know in an s3

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,200
you know s3 bucket in the cloud you can

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,690
have data in Azure data Lake you can

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,130
have data on HDFS and you have data and

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,040
kudu it doesn't really matter where your

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,380
data is the with clutter SDX

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,750
you set the policies on the data you set

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,540
the security and governance policies on

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,540
the data we've got a common catalog a

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,250
shared data catalog that allows those

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,840
policies in the data context so that's

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,390
really what we're talking about is the

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,770
data context the context remains with

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,140
the data so that no matter where the

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,490
data lives it's got all those policies

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,470
and all the information about the data

00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,360
wrapped up inside of it so as long as

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,790
the analytic application can access that

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,220
data you know you've got the experience

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,440
that you want and is there any hidden

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:08,500
performance because we're able to bring

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,350
all these together from silos no

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,910
absolutely not in fact you know we hear

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,360
from customers and one of the one of the

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,070
reasons they love code era is because

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,600
they don't have to operate in silos and

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,400
when you've got this shared experience

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,120
what we're talking about is the ability

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,920
to develop much faster because you're

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,360
working you've got all of your

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,610
applications being brought to bear at

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,650
the same time there's not you know

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,650
there's not an issue of I've got to wait

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,640
for this ETL cluster to finish doing its

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,440
job before I can run my analytics you

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,990
can do both of them the same time at

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,060
this with the same shared set of data

00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,430
and so you're empowering self-service

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,080
when you empower self-service you're

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,150
gonna you're gonna be able to develop

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,290
and bring products to market more

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,810
quickly and the other thing it does is

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,210
it also helps reduce cost because now

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,040
you're not dealing with data silos

00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:03,070
anymore and you know there's an expense

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,040
for every every silo that you set up

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:07,930
right every you know bespoke application

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,240
has a cost to it here if you've got a

00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,650
common platform there's one you know

00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,650
there's one expense that you're dealing

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,010
with and then it also helps really

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,540
reduce risk because now you've got

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,450
governance and security policy that

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,820
travel with the data so you can be sure

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,040
you know your your compliance officer

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,840
security office can be sure that

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,880
the right people are going to be able to

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,760
access only the data that they need that

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,700
there's an audit trail that's associated

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,590
with the data so if you you know are

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,770
ever audited you know where the data's

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,790
been who's touched it the types of

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,920
transformations the applications that

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:49,770
have used it and increasingly we see

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:52,810
this really as use cases multiplied in

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,490
environments and often move from you

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,540
know the first the first use cases are

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,280
often cases where company is trying to

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,260
you know try and reduce risk or create

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,320
efficiencies or those are the you know

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,780
the the sittin saving you know defensive

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,220
type strategies its cost-saving its

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,290
taking risk out of the business that's

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,660
often a an initial use case it'll be

00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,910
operating on a set pool of data for

00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,290
those particular use cases and then

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,940
we'll see over time as companies start

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,860
realizing that there's actually value in

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,900
that data and that they can use similar

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,930
data that's used to maybe reduce risk or

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,180
to take down costs they can take that

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,820
same data and apply it towards you know

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,560
a use case that drives profit that boost

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,290
revenue that increases customer lifetime

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,560
value it's really important for the data

00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,660
that was operating over here to look

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,460
consistent with the data that's over

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,130
there and there needs to be a governance

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,160
and audit string attached to that data

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,990
and well this SDX work with IOT data and

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,110
data at the very edge of things and is

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,910
it gonna yeah that's that's a that's an

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,770
excellent excellent use case for that so

00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,080
in Mike's keynote today we heard from

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,230
Navistar Navistar 'aa been a customer of

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,610
ours for for quite some time now and

00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,240
they've got a tremendous tremendous

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:10,000
preventative maintenance use case that

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,710
they discussed on stage and and this is

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,630
a use case that ballooned over time from

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,510
you know a handful of trucks to now over

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,950
300,000 plus vehicles and now what

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:21,130
they're doing is they're looking at use

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:24,070
cases that go beyond just unplanned

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:27,220
downtime to autonomous vehicles so you

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,870
see the use cases changing over time the

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,930
application is getting bigger and more

00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,130
complex and they're using SDX to make

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,200
all that happen they're make they're

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,910
using SDX to govern the data to make

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,320
sure that it's secure and they've got

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,940
the common catalog to know that the

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,680
that's being applied to this SKUs case

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,470
is also being applied there and that it

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,930
you know that it meets the standards

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,880
that needs to meet excellent so David if

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,730
we sat down twelve months from now we

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,620
have this conversation and I ask you

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,880
how's the journey been with STX and do

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,800
you hope to be saying I have to be

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:01,400
saying it's up in the clouds it really

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,010
is that that's that is where STX is is

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,740
heading and where we see the greatest

00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:09,170
need for a shared a shared data

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,040
experience is in cloud platforms today

00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:15,140
so right now today our customers can you

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,810
know get multi cluster governance multi

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,130
cluster security and multiply cluster

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,370
catalog and that's really really

00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,440
important ultimately we want to do is

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,530
knock down knock down all the data silos

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,660
that we can in cloud particularly this

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,420
is this is difficult to do if you're

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,360
operating you know with with certain

00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,950
cloud house offerings and you're using

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,900
you're using you know some of their data

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,210
processing engines that's going to write

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,010
data down to a datastore in order for

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,900
you to run analytics on that same pool

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,790
of data you've actually got to extract

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,920
that data and move it to another

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,930
proprietary file system for you to do

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,090
for you to do those analytics that takes

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,510
time it costs money and it creates

00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:59,090
governance risk with SDX you can run the
