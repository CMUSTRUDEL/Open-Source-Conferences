hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,799
data in New York City I'm here with Matt

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,049
Winkler from Microsoft Matt how you

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,389
doing I'm doing well are you good so how

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,210
is this event been for you guys oh it's

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,740
it's been it's been really great on a

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,650
couple of different a couple of

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,029
different angles you know it's been it's

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,640
always good to get the to meet the

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,109
attendees hanging out at the booth kind

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,220
of having everybody come through and

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,380
talking about what we're up to and

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,880
hearing what's interesting for them I've

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,390
had a number of different sessions

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,640
across the the conference on topics

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,200
ranging from data cataloging to

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,600
different deep learning techniques for

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,090
text analysis as well as deployment to

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,420
edge devices and so it's always good to

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,399
give those talks reception to those

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,980
who's been been well and then Joseph

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,530
Soroush was in on the keynote this

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,550
morning along with Dana Boyd talking

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,289
about you know kind of some of the work

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,190
that they're up to and so it's been

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,920
great excellent

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,750
so when you look at the AI market it to

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,960
me it looks like in a way the Kentucky

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:07,170
Derby there's like eight six to eight

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,659
maybe contenders that want to win and

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,100
want to be the leader how do you see

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,840
that shaping up in the next couple of

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,750
years yeah to me it's it's a super

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880
exciting time you know we can kind of

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,130
rewind the clock to you know the stratas

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,610
that we were having a number of years

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,740
ago as kind of big data was happening it

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,170
actually feels kind of even more kind of

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,240
ready to explode than that in some ways

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,799
and I think it's you know if you look at

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,229
people at every layer of the stack

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,369
whether that's a hardware vendor or all

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,740
the way up to you know somebody who's

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,710
building SAS applications you know we're

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,329
trying to make you know life better for

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,610
our customers we're trying to create

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,930
engaging products and you know the ways

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,060
that we can do that are greatly

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,320
influenced by a lot of these techniques

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,149
being able to create something that's

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,280
more personalized and has better

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,869
recommendations can engage with you more

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,180
effectively or makes you more productive

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,270
you know I think we see kind of everyone

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,149
looking to go and do that and one of the

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,610
things I love about working at Microsoft

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,210
is the the breadth at which we can go

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,190
and do that

00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,600
you know kind of ranging from you know

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,190
something like putting features into

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,680
office you know whether that's Word or

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,780
PowerPoint or into a set of SAS

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,770
applications like dynamics you know for

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,120
managing CRM or ERP all the way down to

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,100
the platform layer where we're looking

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,160
to go and enable developers and data

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,810
scientists to go build these same things

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,030
for their applications and that's I

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,850
spend most of my time at that platform

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,010
layer and it's it's incredibly inspiring

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,600
to see all of the different customer use

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,300
cases that kind of come through these

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,610
you know everyone is looking at how do

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,830
they get an advantage from the data that

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,270
they have and hungry company every

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,680
company and that every division in

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,350
Microsoft's probably doing that as well

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,370
yeah yeah yeah you know we have you know

00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,250
kind of if you think about the

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,080
birthday-cake diagram you know kind of

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,510
at the platform layer of the hardware

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,090
services and software that we provide we

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,340
end up having you know internal

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,290
customers just as well as external

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,360
customers and you know what's exciting

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,800
is to see kind of there they're doing

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,210
many of the same things they're using

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,620
lots of the same tools and techniques

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,380
and yeah and so Microsoft really you

00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:24,930
know you span every every piece of this

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,580
whole stack right you have large

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,390
enterprise customers that worked with

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,280
you for decades you have large

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,740
enterprise customers that are fairly new

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,230
and trying to transform but they don't

00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,950
want to be left out so how are you guys

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:43,590
as such a big company working with some

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,690
of your larger partners how do you do in

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,580
a fighh and bring all that together yeah

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:53,100
you know that is you know something that

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,320
really impacts every part of the process

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,940
from you know kind of what our field and

00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,800
account teams do and how they interact

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,120
with customers all the way down to you

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,480
know what are the products and services

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,490
and tools that we're building and we try

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,350
and work across that that stack of folks

00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,510
kind of all the way from product out to

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,130
customer and you know one of the

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,440
exciting things is really seeing the

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,660
engagement that you know we get to have

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,040
with customers you know directly on the

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,840
teams that are building the product hope

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,210
to learn from them to hear from them

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,750
this is what's working for us or hey

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,490
this is a technique that start

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,830
to become really interesting how can I

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,180
go solve this problem and you know from

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,470
a product perspective we can look at

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,030
that and then start to design things

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,250
that will go scale out to more and more

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,100
customers we're also looking to solve

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,960
very very similar problems so do we have

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,480
a little bit of a cart in a horse

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,900
situation where we're ahead with data

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,730
now but AI is gonna accelerate and get

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:55,150
going really fast and do we have do we

00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:57,520
have enough knowledge how to put this to

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,930
real use right now I think we're

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,860
starting to see a lot of the use cases

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,750
emerge I think it's I think you can look

00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,640
at it and say we're very early in the

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,910
stage of how companies are going to go

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,980
and transform and they're looking at how

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,150
do they do that in a responsible way in

00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,690
kind of a way that's best for their

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,310
customer that's a cool way yeah and you

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,830
know so I think we're early on in that I

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,470
think people are trying to be very

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,250
intentional about how they learn and

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,530
apply these techniques but I think what

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,669
we'll see over the next you know you

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,320
know certainly in the next kind of 12 to

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:34,600
18 months short term but then kind of

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,270
the three to five year long term I think

00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,060
you're going to see an explosion of you

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,340
know organizations that are leveraging

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,050
the insight from their data to go make

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,490
better decisions and to go build better

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,660
products you know and in some ways you

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,430
can look at some of this as just a

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,160
continuation of a path they may already

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,440
be on but enabling them to have new

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,510
tools and new techniques a really good

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,250
example is we've worked with a number of

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,470
customers that are looking you know that

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,729
are they're working in you know

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,460
industries that have been around for a

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,169
very long time power you know

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,810
transportation and they're looking now

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,729
at how can they take you know drone

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,169
based imagery and use that to augment

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,060
their predictive maintenance scenarios

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,380
you know so those are things that have

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,700
been around for a while predictive

00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,560
maintenance power but really now hey I

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,630
can actually take images and analyze

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,540
those as part of the data that I'm using

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,300
and so you know we see a lot of that so

00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,950
we're really just on that steep curve

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,080
going up with with the AI and machine

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,349
learning it's it's really on that steep

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,300
slope yeah so if we were to sit down 12

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:41,220
months from now

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,750
how much further up that slow part we're

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,460
gonna be what are we gonna be seeing in

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,830
the market do you think yeah I mean I

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,110
think the the things that we'll be

00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,840
seeing in the market I think if you look

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,970
at kind of the the trends that we see

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,240
today you know the notion about being

00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,220
able to deploy AI as close to the event

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,730
as possible I think we're gonna see more

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,410
of that we've seen a tremendous uptick

00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,580
in customers that are doing things you

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,860
know an Internet of Things style

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,590
scenarios and they're moving you know

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,840
past monitoring you know or even

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,200
alerting you know really to how can I go

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,550
and push decisions to the thing so I

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,750
think that's one thing we'll see I think

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,460
you'll continue to see an explosion of

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:26,190
frameworks and tools I think that you

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,170
know it's kind of a very yeah it's a fun

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,560
time to be a technologist because that

00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:34,890
expansion is occurring one of the

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,140
exciting things I think of as the kind

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,800
of hardware arms race that's happening

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:43,500
you know across CPUs GPUs FPGAs and

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,200
other stuff all of that's going to

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,490
result in a win for customers because

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,520
they're gonna get a lot of choice and

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,560
form-factor and cost and latency and I

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,840
think you know in 12 months time those
