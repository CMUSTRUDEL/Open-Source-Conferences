	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,780
hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,759
dated in New York I'm here with Aaron

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,440
banks from Dell EMC Aaron how're you

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,840
doing I'm great how are you good

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,910
so last year we talked and I last

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,889
question asked you where will we be in

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,269
twelve months can you take me through

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,970
your journey these last twelve months

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,609
and tell me where you guys are yeah it's

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,869
been a good journey it's been taken some

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,420
time but seem that went really really

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,330
fast and technically we're dealt

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,769
technologies with strategically aligned

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,420
businesses beneath it so when you think

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:36,120
about Dell MC Dell VMware pivotal RSA

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,100
secure works virtustream these are the

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,829
companies that really combine to become

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,870
Dell technologies so I work obviously

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,420
under Dell EMC coming from the heritage

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,270
EMC standpoint but it's been great we've

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,649
really we've really come together which

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,660
has been really nice to kind of see

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,520
these two kind of cultures become one

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,260
and it's been great to see how I

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
remember last year I said that I was

00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,890
hoping that we could keep it simple

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,809
right I just hope that having these two

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,399
companies it wasn't gonna be kind of

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,769
confusing the customers says the worst

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,420
part and it's been great and we've been

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,760
able to pull products together like

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,830
we've just released a ready bundles with

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,119
Isilon attached to it because before it

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,799
would be especially like in a Hadoop

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,750
environment there might be a little bit

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,520
of competition between the two companies

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,380
yeah and now we're able to really pull

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,729
them together to really find like the

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,720
most perfect offering for customers and

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,290
that's been great and you were keeping

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,700
it simple

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,490
yeah really isn't that the hardest part

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,080
yes because and I've always like tried

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,369
to stress that infrastructure should

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,200
always be the last thing that you think

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,700
of and we're still continuing to keep

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,860
that motto right keeping it simple

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,930
working from an application perspective

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,060
right what is the problem you're trying

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,829
to solve but not know not only that it's

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,439
what do you need to do to have your

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,700
business become successful how what do

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,590
you need to have that competitive edge

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,210
and that's how we drive it and making

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,890
sure that we're providing offerings and

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,750
services that can really give the

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,360
customers that but exactly we so need to

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,759
keep it simple so keeping it simple Dell

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,009
itself Dell EMC Dell technologies

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,840
whatever we're calling you guys yes you

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,460
guys are also going through your own

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
transformation as you bring all those

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,500
entities together and then you're

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,459
helping your partners with that

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,690
transformation for them as well yeah

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,760
absolutely and that's always been the

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,230
one thing that I've found is really

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,620
great as we're going through this

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,330
digital

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,830
transformation and helping customers do

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,319
that that's been one of the most

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,450
powerful things that customers seem to

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,760
get from us what I've noticed when I do

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,680
like meetings with customers sometimes

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,260
we just follow it up with a meeting of

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,390
how have we built out our data analytics

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,519
ecosystem ourselves and customers really

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,470
Drive into that and understanding how a

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,040
company especially as big as ours Dell

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,049
MC 140,000 employees and how we're

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,700
really managing putting data together

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,620
from the two companies right how is our

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,859
chief data governance officer really

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,440
working to tagging everything correctly

00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:51,239
looking at everything correctly keeping

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,459
the data clean and we had a process

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,930
already but now it's really putting

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,090
everything to the test to making sure

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,030
that we are achieving that now as Dell

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,220
MC and so as you're achieving this the

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,590
world is changing really quickly yeah so

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,319
we have AI machine learning and all

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,810
these things happening we also have IOT

00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,720
all over the edges yes so how are you

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,690
guys bringing all that into what you're

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,459
doing and then helping your partners do

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,989
that same sort of thing yes so we're

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,519
definitely tackling it from certainly

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,099
from a machine learning perspective and

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,040
still we really see it almost the same

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,780
right it's still gonna be we still have

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,260
to handle the data and we're still

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,280
continuing to do that and we're creating

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,650
technology and working with partners to

00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,599
really give offerings to customers like

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,700
with GPUs that really provide great

00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,019
capabilities because again it's gonna

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,359
always be about the application that's

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,069
running on top from an IOT perspective

00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,519
we've been doing some really amazing

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:50,819
things we just announced that VMware has

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,829
released the IOT pulse Control Center

00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,400
and that's been really great for us to

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:57,930
really understand how we can manage

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,150
devices from an IOT perspective in both

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,609
Dell EMC and VMware our founding men

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,530
meant founding members of the edge X

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,840
foundry which is part of the Linux

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,220
Foundation and we're not only founders

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,480
but obviously contributors to that and

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,069
that's been really important for us to

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,930
continue to again have all of these

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,150
companies together under the dell

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,560
technologies umbrella working to really

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,239
provide offerings to our customers

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,280
that's simple because heritage Dell was

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,370
already in the IOT market they were

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,380
doing gateways and from a heritage EMC

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,100
standpoint we weren't in it too much and

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,570
then again now

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,430
we've become these like larger entities

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,050
together and we've really been able to

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,190
kind of drive that ship moving it

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:35,380
forward and exactly you're seen doing

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,790
this digital transformation together and

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,620
making sure that we're all on path for

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,810
that so when you're working with your

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,700
partners right now and I know maybe this

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,600
comes through pivotal and other parts of

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,120
the Dell EMC Empire but do you see two

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,740
main things happening there's

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,800
transformation with partners and there's

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,630
the disruptors right and are they both

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,730
have the same needs they both want to

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,310
own a market but their use of

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,110
technologies different yeah I wouldn't

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,700
say I don't find right now that their

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,680
use of technology is different in the

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,000
sense of obviously yeah you don't want

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,710
to be disrupted you want to be the

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,780
disrupter right and we've always been

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,920
saying that from that aspect and I think

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,570
when it comes down to it it's really

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,040
what you're doing above the

00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,380
infrastructure what you're doing with

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,090
the power of that data that hat is gonna

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,290
have a biggest effect and define that

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,540
right that's what we talked about this

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,370
how this digital transformation is so

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,170
essential both from a data analytics

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,170
perspective and an IOT perspective as

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,730
well security to really managing the

00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,590
data have finding the power of that data

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:36,490
the value of it and really being able to

00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,110
excel it in your business so we started

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,660
out this conversation about our

00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,290
conversation twelve months yeah let's

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,640
let's back that up a little teeny bit

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,310
what do you see on your horizon

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,740
at Dell EMC in the next three months and

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,170
then let's also look forward to next

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,640
year's conversation as well so three and

00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,810
twelve months yeah I think our first

00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,450
initiative certainly from a data

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,100
analytics perspective is to drive IOT

00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:02,080
and data analogs together or more of

00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,090
like an analytics of things right so our

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,670
project Nautilus the work that's being

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,330
done out of VMware and also you know

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:11,560
creating this almost like the idea of

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,030
taking the hyper-converged

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,710
infrastructure so taking the dough and

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,360
seeing the VMware and the tools that we

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,400
have and putting those components at the

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,170
edge really so that more of the you're

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,930
able to do those analytics at the edge

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,790
is really where we're driving that IOT

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,500
market and really feel like it's

00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,970
essential to you know we always talk

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,890
about where you learn and it was a great

00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,870
quote from this morning in the keynote

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,610
where you know you act locally and

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,870
you're doing all of those making those

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,880
decisions that you have to do locally

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,200
and what is the right capabilities of

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,249
doing that and that's what's been so

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,509
great about having all these

00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:43,029
things together so we could provide that

00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,579
is hyper-converged a deli MC word or is

00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:47,529
that oh yeah absolutely standard yeah

00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:49,779
it's industry standard but it's also you

00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,909
know deli MC is number one in the market

00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,169
with regard to hyper-converged so it's

00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:55,479
been really great for us to really take

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,769
those strong points from those

00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,269
individual businesses from these

00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:59,829
strategically aligned businesses and
