Publication date: 2017-09-28
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Data is powering the largest trucks on Americaâ€™s interstates, the buses that take our children to school, and the military vehicles that help protect our country. Terry Kline and Mike Olson look at how machine learning and predictive analytics keep more than 300,000+ connected vehicles rolling.

	00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:04,799
so why is everybody getting connected

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,410
and what's the big transformation that's

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,460
going on in the industry I live in you

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,440
know a lot of people will talk about

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,280
autonomous vehicles ten years five years

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,250
in the next four years in the trucking

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,700
industry there's two hundred and thirty

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,520
six billion dollars that will be driven

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,440
out of this industry

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,720
most of its in the supply chain the

00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,210
stuff that's real close by and it's the

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,460
load matters the load hailers that are

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,649
coming into the industry and if you

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,110
think about those guys there's it's all

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:41,370
about speed to scale an electrification

00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:44,489
we announced in fact our electric

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,050
electric medium-duty truck for 2019 just

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,750
earlier this week at the North America

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,210
commercial vehicle show an autonomous

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,850
autonomous vehicles are running today

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,829
and in spaces and combined restricted

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:01,500
areas and they'll be on our highways

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:04,559
soon you know we anistar we like to say

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,630
we can create the future we really have

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,220
the opportunity to make this be what we

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,200
want it to be and to get in front of it

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,490
and we've got three hundred and thirty

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,479
thousand vehicles in our system today

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,810
we're integrated with twenty five

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,330
telematics providers the other key

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,040
takeaway besides to be to scale us you

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:28,650
can't be proprietary you're connected

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,189
strategy can't just be about your

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,130
product it has to be about the

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,470
experience and the customer if you're

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,430
connected strategy is just about your

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,030
product there won't be a chair when the

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,829
music stops eventually so we're leading

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,500
remote diagnostics company that's how we

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:54,450
started but we're open architected open

00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:00,540
system two-thirds of the trucks in our

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:04,020
database are not trucks we built 2/3 of

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,029
the vehicles in my database our database

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:12,420
are not our trucks that offers a lot of

00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:14,910
data to us but it offers a seamless e

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,030
the interface to the people who use our

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:20,250
systems in our connected environment

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,950
that's a key takeaway if you're building

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,330
an IOT system has to be open has to let

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,330
the competitors brands in

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,020
