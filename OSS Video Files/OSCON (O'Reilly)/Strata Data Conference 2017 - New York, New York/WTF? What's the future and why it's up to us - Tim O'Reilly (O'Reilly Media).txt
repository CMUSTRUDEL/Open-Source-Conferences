Title: WTF? What's the future and why it's up to us - Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media)
Publication date: 2017-09-28
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Robots are going to take our jobs, they say. Tim O'Reilly says, "Only if that's what we ask them to do!" Tim has had his fill of technological determinism. He explains why technology is the solution to human problems and why we won't run out of work till we run out of problems.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
here's a really important concept that I

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,390
learned many years ago at O'Reilly that

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,719
shaped our thinking about ourselves as a

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,130
platform for all of the people involved

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,049
in our community and that is that a

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,639
business model is the way that all the

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,139
parts of a business work together to

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,779
create competitive advantage and

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,430
customer value this sort of a mistake

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,100
that a lot of people make when they look

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,050
at say an app like uber or lyft taxi

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,269
companies for example say well we love

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,599
that app you know if only we had an app

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,969
we could compete with these guys but in

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,100
fact the thing that they hate about uber

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,710
and lyft which is that they have these

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,440
unlicensed drivers who come into the

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,649
market are part of the secret of the

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,360
business model because demand as demand

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,760
scales so does supply

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,190
whereas in the old business model you

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,949
had only a set number of people who were

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,199
there available so busy times they're

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,449
just not enough cabs to go around so you

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,550
can see how those pieces go together and

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,440
the reason why I bring that up is it's

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,960
really important as you think about

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,960
business models and technology that you

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,659
don't just replicate the old what was

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,890
there you know we actually had connected

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,170
taxicabs in 2005 and what they did was

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,210
they said Wow we're digital we're cool

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,340
we'll do what all the internet people

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,830
are doing we'll put a screen running ads

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,689
in the back of the cab that wasn't

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,119
really searching out the possibilities

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,189
of the future and we have to realize

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,259
that so many of our first halting

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,360
attempts to deal with new technology

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,070
like AI are going to look like that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,070
screen in the back of the taxicab

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,310
they're going to be some way of pasting

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:46,619
on the old model onto something new and

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,799
we have to seek out the new so in a key

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,770
part again this lesson from uber and

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,720
lyft is of the Augmented worker the

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,110
reason why you have that supply of

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,509
drivers is because you have Google Maps

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,020
and the equivalent you have the ability

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,329
to cognitively in augmented

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,729
in the same way that the machines of the

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,800
Industrial Revolution gave us much

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,050
bigger muscles so that we could erect

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,770
these giant buildings that we could dig

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,080
tunnels on

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,320
the see that we could fly through the

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,350
air these new cognitive augmentations

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,260
let us do new tasks find a passenger in

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,240
the haystack of the city a needle just

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,260
lost them holla hey but yes match them

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,020
up in real time

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,110
that's an augmentation of our capability

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,810
I think Joanna said it beautifully

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,940
earlier when she said you know this is

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,350
just the culmination of 12,000 years of

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,690
artificial intelligence that we're

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:44,940
heading into cognitive augmentation is a

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,420
key part of the future of our economy

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,450
and we have to get good at it but think

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,240
about throwing away the narrative that

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,300
we're using technology to automate away

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,950
people to get rid of them instead figure

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,580
out how we're going to use technology to

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,580
