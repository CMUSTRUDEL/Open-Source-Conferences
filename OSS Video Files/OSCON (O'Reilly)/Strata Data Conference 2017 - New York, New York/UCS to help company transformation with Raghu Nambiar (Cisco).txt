hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,150
data in New York I'm here with Raghu

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,810
Nambiar from Cisco how you doing I'm

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,620
doing good

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,880
so you're the CTO of UCS at Cisco what

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,279
what is UCS yes you see a stand for

00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,289
unified computing system it is our data

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,990
center compute platform we introduced

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,230
this product in 2009 it has been an

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,050
exciting ride we have a number one

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,140
market share for blade systems in in

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,140
North America and number two worldwide

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,600
and so UCS is that one of the agents

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,579
used in transforming large companies I

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,860
mean I think you guys you've written a

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,840
book recently transforming industry

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,550
through data analytics and it's one with

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,789
O'Reilly yeah

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,370
and so the UCS is the data compute

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,500
platform ok this is the general purpose

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,739
platform built on industry standard

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,859
technologies so you can run traditional

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,739
applications of like Oracle Microsoft JP

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:05,060
on top of UCS not so like emerging

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,920
technologies like Hadoop and no SQL

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,380
again it's a industry standard part for

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
general purpose so we have been working

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,990
with a lot of our software partners to

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,880
create joint solutions some of the joint

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,920
solution could be for transformation

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,530
right I mean isn't every company they're

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,110
going through transformation or facing

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,180
disruption pretty much yes in this world

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,810
and you talked a little bit about the

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,770
disruption in here especially in cities

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,990
in energy manufacturing healthcare and

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,990
transportation are those the main retail

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:44,310
too but yeah everything right so if you

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:48,840
look at the fortune 500 list okay it was

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:52,020
introduced in 1955 the belief but today

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,079
only 12% of the companies are still in

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,670
the list yeah first of them are part of

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,490
the history and when if there's a

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,920
Moore's law with that list yeah so but

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,939
if you look at the next ten years the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:10,000
companies that are going to survive is

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:14,680
going to be the companies who

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,540
has a strong analytics strategy okay

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,210
data different strategy if you don't

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,870
have that you're going to be part of

00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,130
history

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:27,490
so all in this book I talked about the

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,340
disruption in five major radius needs

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:35,040
the cities we all live in cities smart

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:40,320
cities yeah Chinese smart so it is sexy

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,390
at present the urban population is

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,010
increasing okay by 2030 you're talking

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:50,459
about 5.1 billion people living in the

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:54,070
cities it is not going to be sustainable

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:57,340
unless we make some significant changes

00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:00,400
basically transforming the city to smart

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:05,260
cities that's one area the other one is

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:09,040
energy combining technologies like smart

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,770
grid and smart metering transforming

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,150
transforming the utility sector

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,660
beneficial to both the providers as well

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,180
as the customers then manufacturing

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,220
right we've come industry for water

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,350
initiatives combining the power of IOT

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,900
and analytics

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:34,390
the other one is healthcare and I think

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:37,440
GDP is spent on connecting technology we

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,950
can transform the healthcare industry

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,760
basically the portal is a significant

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,220
you can technically connect patients to

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,290
doctors anywhere using connected

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,329
technologies the last one is a

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,000
transportation that is one of the

00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:58,959
closely related series throws little

00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,720
cities yeah and and we have seen like

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,579
over like innovations in transportation

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,450
and significance you can find out

00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:09,570
virtual space from from self-driving

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,540
cars to all kinds of cool things

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,970
excellent so of these of these

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,530
industries which ones do you think are

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,500
the most forward-thinking

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,549
you know moving moving quicker towards

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,520
bringing data

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:26,560
platform into play starting to use the

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,050
analytics and the data that they have to

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,020
feed into their machine learning and

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:38,650
their AI there any industries that are

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:40,990
kind of ahead here I think especially

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,139
with the you know smart metering and a

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:46,990
smart grid followed by manufacturing

00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:49,090
okay but from a potential perspective

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,629
like in a large scale it is going to be

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,789
healthcare yeah and and transforming the

00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:57,400
cities the healthcare touches everyone

00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,960
pretty much yeah and cities do too well

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,719
they do unless you live in a really

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,580
remote rural area the very few of those

00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:06,639
lucky people you know there's some of us

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,639
living like mega cities with 10 million

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,629
people so there is a lot of opportunity

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,370
for everyone in in this new economy that

00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,919
we're developing this this looks like

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,979
we're this is the forefront of a new

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,509
economy that's emerging everywhere so

00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,340
there's gonna be a lot of opportunity

00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:29,620
how does Cisco help large companies

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,509
recognize the opportunity and then get

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,229
involved and do something about the

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:38,319
opportunity so if you look at digital

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,770
transformation or next generation of

00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,400
opportunities it is going to be around

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:48,219
connecting the unconnected like

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,430
connecting you know people connecting

00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:53,949
devices and Cisco is the networking

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,719
company just up on the edge in a way to

00:05:53,949 --> 00:06:00,669
it and to the core yeah right so so if

00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:02,710
you look at you know in some of the use

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,199
cases in energy and the manufacturing

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:09,340
lot of data would be generated the edge

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,680
by devices you have to do a lot of

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,629
processing at the edge because for two

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,460
reasons one is you may not have the

00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,610
network bandwidth second thing is you

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,960
need immediate response right so lot of

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,680
analytics you will have to happen at the

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,599
edge then the data will be sent to the

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,150
data center core for further processing

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:32,349
so there is a network in between you

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,689
have to encrypt the data okay so this is

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,669
Co is all over this

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:38,099
from the edge as well as the enterprise

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:42,529
and the enterprise data will end up on a

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:45,779
like a Hadoop cluster or a database

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:48,629
management system running on Cisco UCS

00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,339
again that is our data center computer

00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,409
platform it almost sounds like we're

00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:54,569
building pipelines and flow again like

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,089
we did with oil way back when it's like

00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,519
if it's at the edge we're bringing it in

00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:01,889
and we're making it quick enough to feed

00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:05,429
into some right back out into the field

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:07,860
again or it could be down to the

00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:11,389
personal level into a device that alerts

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,459
you that your blood sugar is too high or

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,069
are you to keep your systems it's kind

00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:20,129
of aggregation here then you have actual

00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,979
devices the example that you gave with

00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,379
the blood of intelligence right that

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,469
intelligence is going to go pretty much

00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:30,599
in line with the Moore's Law the the

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:32,549
compute capability storage capabilities

00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,729
and look at its capabilities all are

00:07:32,549 --> 00:07:39,089
going to be increasing it's going to be

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:40,889
exciting so how do you work with your

00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:44,099
fellow c-level people at other

00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:46,709
organizations that want to get started

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,360
what are the what are the main

00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,249
principles you tell them that they need

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,669
to put in place before they can even

00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:56,869
begin this transformation journey I mean

00:07:53,669 --> 00:08:04,589
first of all they have to understand it

00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:08,369
the business ok and identify areas that

00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:13,110
you can improve especially improve based

00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:16,099
on a data-driven analytics approach let

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,039
me give an example for example of retail

00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:23,689
ok so that industry has transformed a

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,979
lot over lasted several years ok so now

00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:30,360
like let me give you an example of

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,309
Amazon if you go to amazon.com buy a

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,430
book it is going to make a

00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:38,909
recommendation people who bought this

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:41,490
book also bought those ok so such a

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:44,149
recommendation engines ok becoming

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,670
extremely important

00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:52,310
in a retail industry in general so

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:55,370
basically know your customer know their

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,190
behavior and offer them personalized

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,199
recommendations yes so on that example

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,990
then when we get to real intelligent

00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:06,350
systems and I think Amazon is on the

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:09,380
forefront of helping us discover but it

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,850
doesn't know me it could go one step

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,579
further and say is this book for you

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,949
when I order it because if I start

00:09:13,579 --> 00:09:17,449
getting pummeled with children's books

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:21,350
obviously I'm buying them for my kids

00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:26,779
rather than if I was getting stuff that

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:29,449
I really want to read so but you know

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:31,760
that is you're talking about a personal

00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:34,970
recommendation for a person right

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,670
actually in a more than retail I think

00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,070
personal recommendation make more sense

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,410
in healthcare if you look at today

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,260
pretty much all the medications are

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,480
general purpose right so personalized

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,610
medication that is going to be the next

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,130
step a big thing in the healthcare and

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,230
maybe even take that step further so I'm

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,930
looking forward to this ai world where

00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,420
we take things really forward and make

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:02,600
recommendations so if your doctor

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,760
prescribes statins for you there's a

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,149
recommendation that these people also

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,930
have taken red rice yeast they may drink

00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:14,750
puer tea instead of the statin that can

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,779
deteriorate your liver there are other

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,639
options but we don't get those now or is

00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:25,060
that where health care might go to some

00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:29,470
doc I mean that is the vision around the

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:33,079
next generation of health care system

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:36,260
there I mean I have I have it in my book

00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,670
the digitization in health care with the

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:44,720
Big Data technologies so you have

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:49,550
sanitized information about a large

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,620
number of patients okay by learning deep

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,180
learning exactly you can come up with

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,140
the personal recommendation

00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,790
for you based on you know the profiles

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,650
of large number of people matches that

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,530
with your profile and you can be excited

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,360
yeah it is gonna be so in your book you

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,060
describe give four different types of

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,800
analysis can you explain why there are

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,300
four different types or what they're for

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:22,170
yeah so I have a classified and

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:27,630
analytics into four classes you know

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:29,490
based on the type of data set in the

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,620
type of recommendation that you know

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,690
your company would be looking for it's a

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,240
it's a theoretical very very very very

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:41,220
high level but another thing that I have

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:43,350
done is based on at the technology that

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,250
is available you know if you look at

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,100
analytics there are software systems IDs

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,710
in a matured our last several years I

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,650
put them into like five categories one

00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:58,860
is the business analytics the kind of

00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,320
analytics that we have been doing for a

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,400
while like enterprise data warehousing

00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,250
and things like that

00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:10,110
second one is some big data analytics

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,480
like primarily from a Hadoop ecosystem

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,870
point of view like the building and data

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,050
Lake and building application on top of

00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,390
that third one is IT operations

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:26,360
analytics that is becoming one of the

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:29,610
fastest growing areas basically a

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:32,130
analytics over data generated by

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,470
applications and machines the next one

00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,750
is IOT it's pretty obvious analytics the

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,490
edge you know where the data is produced

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,010
and you know under castlecore

00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,980
we're historical analysis and model

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:46,130
building stuff last one is AI and I'm

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,650
deep learning and machine learning with

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,120
emerging technologies so five categories

00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,280
that's what I have in the book and

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,170
that's all in here yes and how many

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,950
pages is just so like there's a lot

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,210
packed in here 50 60 pages is it

00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:02,700
excellent excellent

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:05,010
this is one step so if we were to sit

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,760
down next year twelve months from now

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:10,529
and if we were to revisit this book

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,300
would you have to do a new addition is

00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:20,190
the world transforming quick enough to

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:25,350
wear one year maybe 5% but in five years

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,740
a talking about 50% new because this is

00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,870
looking out in the forefront yes it is

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,339
talking about you know smart cities you

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,019
know transforming as it is going to take

00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:37,160
a long time sure right

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,240
and for me people governments and

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,889
healthcare again you're talking about

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,079
what's forward-looking

00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:45,660
and transportation like a self-driving

00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,170
cars and we have we have come a long way

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,449
but we have a long way to go so so which

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,649
can be the quickest change here in all

00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:54,959
of these different areas is

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:58,199
manufacturing manufacturer would be or

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,959
the biggest yeah yeah yeah already you

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:02,610
know bottom about yeah ragu we look

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,889
forward to that conversation and would

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,449
see how it unfolds in the future thank

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,449
you very much thanks for you exciting

00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,269
