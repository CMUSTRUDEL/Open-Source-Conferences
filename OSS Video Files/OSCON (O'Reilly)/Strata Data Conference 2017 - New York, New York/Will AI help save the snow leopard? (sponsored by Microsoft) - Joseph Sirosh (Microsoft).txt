	00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:10,590
in the remote mountains of the Himalayas

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:14,580
in an area ten times the size of New

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,820
York State there lives a creature so

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,720
rarely seen that it's called a ghost of

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:26,610
the mountain it's a Snow Leopard one of

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:30,120
nature's most magnificent creatures it

00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:35,130
is an apex predator of the Himalayas it

00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:38,460
prey is mountain goats and blue sheep

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:44,280
and it plays an incredible role in

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:46,710
balancing that ecosystem but the Snow

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,090
Leopard is endangered there are only a

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,010
few thousand of them left in the wild

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:57,079
mining destroys entire mountains and

00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:00,630
their habitats they are killed for their

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:05,300
precious hide and bones for Asian

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,580
medicine and the poor farmers and

00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,380
villagers who live there when one of

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,979
their livestock is attacked by a Snow

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,299
Leopard

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:20,729
they take revenge so why should we care

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:24,600
snow leopards and predators like this at

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,860
the top of the pyramid are critical to

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,930
the balance of nature how many of you

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,890
have heard of how the wolf saved the

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:39,690
Yellowstone National Park when the

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:42,810
wolves were reintroduced in 1995 instead

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:48,990
of what ecologists call a trophic

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:51,840
cascade well the wolf controlled the

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,180
deer population then the deer stopped

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,130
all grazing and the plants started

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,750
regrowing back and when the plant

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,540
started growing back there were more

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:04,950
bugs and there were more berries and

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:07,799
then more birds came in and then beavers

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,899
returned and it created dams in the

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,599
rivers and then more otters came and

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,380
then they were more mice and then they

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,650
were

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:20,280
more even more bears and then when the

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,580
rivers had plans on their river banks

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,350
the river banks stabilized and the river

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:31,260
started flowing narrower and better the

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,560
wolf even changed the geography of the

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,920
entire park and in a period of 20 years

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,510
the part became lush and green and

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,000
teeming with life

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:48,570
that's what an apex predator does so the

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,030
question is can be saved a protector of

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,580
the Himalayan ecosystem

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,620
after all a billion people live in the

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,070
watershed of the Himalayas and the

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:02,940
health of that ecosystem is critical to

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:06,420
their well-being as well so the snow

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,930
leopard trust is a passionate group a

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,450
small group of volunteers in CRO

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,340
dedicated solely to this cause it was

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,170
founded by Helen Freeman in 1981 and

00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:22,080
their primary method of conservation is

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:23,610
community-based conservation they work

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,610
with the villagers in these remote

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,890
regions of the Himalayas and partner

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:34,230
with them to prevent poaching and

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:38,010
retribution killing so but to save snow

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:41,910
leopards we must find them how do we

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:45,000
help a species of which we know so

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,580
little we don't know what their real

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,500
habitats are in fact they weren't really

00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,390
seen by scientists until two decades ago

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,520
they're very hard to spot in the rain

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,040
just a small few thousand of them range

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,760
over a very large area so let's play a

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,820
game and I spy game I spy a Snow Leopard

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:13,050
in this image do you so that's where it

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:16,580
is it is one of the most camouflage well

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,850
camouflage animals its natural habitat

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:24,750
so there are two ways of tracking snow

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,860
leopards now GPS collars and camera

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,250
traps

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,830
the most effective way of course is GPS

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,460
collars this is what a GPS collar looks

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,940
like now if you can call it a snow

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,370
leopard it gives you invaluable data the

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,259
data is sent to a satellite and it comes

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,389
down directly to the research lab and

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,430
then you can apply sophisticated data

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,930
signs to it like maximum likelihood

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,060
estimation and others to study its

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,879
behavior even with a few data samples

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,440
and you can actually see the tracks of

00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:57,330
snow leopards these are live tracks of

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,990
snow leopards in the remote mountains of

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:08,490
Mongolia well but it took nine years to

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:11,370
call it 23 and obviously this is not

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,099
scalable to study populations of snow

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:17,909
leopards over such a wide area you need

00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:21,210
a more scalable technology enter camera

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:23,159
traps digital camera traps very robust

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,250
cameras that can take thousands of

00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:29,370
images when triggered by motion or

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:32,759
infrared sensors and as an animal goes

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,810
by so this is what it looks like some of

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,210
the majors captured automatically by the

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:44,000
snow leopard cameras in these remote

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:47,909
mountains now these cameras take

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,539
thousands of pictures and the Snow

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,500
Leopard

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:54,840
Trust has about 300 plus cameras

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,479
distributed all over the region but only

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,219
five staff and they are looking to

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,009
analyze hundreds of thousands even

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:03,900
millions of images and Lord of which are

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:06,569
false positives even a blade of grass

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,210
moving in front of a camera or and eye

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,520
backs or even a camel deciding to squat

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,779
in front of the camera will trigger it

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,449
off and here is a passionate ecologist

00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:22,050
who's been doing this hard work dr.

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:24,599
Kostov Sharma he his workers offered

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,840
climbing the dangerous ridges of

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,659
Himalayas at 5,000 to 10,000 feet and

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,940
more to reach camera traps and get

00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,830
images and then bring it back to the lab

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,630
and classified them and then apply data

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,139
science to it to estimate these

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:45,400
populations

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:48,050
and one of his most tiresome tasks is

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,789
coming back to the lab and having to

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,180
manually classify this vast number of

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:55,939
images it takes 300 hours per survey you

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,009
know 10 to 15 surveys per year fibers

00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:59,539
and contains no lipids and at the rate

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,520
at which he can do these things it'll

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,520
take decades to really understand the

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:11,389
population and the snow leopard may not

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:13,909
have decades so can a I help can be

00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:17,569
built perhaps a heat Mac heat map of the

00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:22,099
snow leopard population using AI well

00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:24,199
enter deep neural networks we took a

00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,110
large number of the snow leopard images

00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,750
and non snow leopard images and built

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,490
deep neural networks for sorting and

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,789
classified them into a Snow Leopard

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,039
image or not a Snow Leopard image this

00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,129
is an example of the architecture we

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,830
used what's called a resin at 50 trained

00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,370
on a vast collection of public data

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,039
called

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:49,310
image net data we used that as a feature

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:51,740
icer for the images and then built a

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,620
custom machine learning model on top of

00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,129
that to classify images into images with

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,610
the snow leopard or without and then we

00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,529
built on Azure as Snow Leopard

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,930
classifier as a service and I'm sure

00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,940
this is the first time you've heard of

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:13,009
the Snow Leopard classifier as a service

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:17,330
well so what happens then his coaster

00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:20,810
from its lab in Kyrgyzstan in Bishkek he

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:23,479
can upload a set of images to a service

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:26,930
in the cloud and and then it sorts it

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,690
and saves him enormous amounts of time

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,849
their first step in applying AI

00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,099
so let's actually hear from coast of

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,810
himself and he would have joined us if

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,300
we could have done Skype but he's

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,310
halfway across the world and I have a

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,409
recorded video

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,540
hi I'm Costa and I work with the Snow

00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,430
Leopard trust as an ecologist going

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,440
through thousands of camera trap images

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,020
is a tedious and probably more

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,390
exhausting task than hiking mountains

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,800
this is where artificial intelligence

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,530
comes to the rescue

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,480
it can save us from the manual labor of

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,910
sifting through hundreds of thousands of

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:06,140
images all I now need to do is upload

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:12,980
photos to a Joe this is like magic this

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:15,050
data is worth its weight in gold so the

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,260
next step that's just the first step in

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:21,830
a journey our next step is then to go

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:24,860
from detection to identification meaning

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:27,110
identify individual snow leopards across

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,910
hundreds of thousands of mages and

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,670
identify individuals so you can track

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:35,330
them now by the way that is a task that

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:38,000
is a lot harder than face identification

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,100
and classifying human faces which we

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,990
made a lot of progress in and if by the

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,790
way any of you want to help in this very

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,880
charitable cause of doing the research

00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,550
to identify unique snow leopards please

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:55,580
let me know it is a very honorable cost

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:58,010
to do so let's take a look at how far

00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,140
conservation efforts have been empowered

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,780
with technology

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,110
when Helen Freeman started the Snow

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:09,410
Leopard trust way back in 1981 their

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,300
most advanced technology was tracking

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,150
snow leopards looking at their

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,960
footprints and estimating from leopard

00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:20,810
scat how many individuals there were and

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,820
now they have GPS collars and digital

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,900
cameras helping them and it amplifies

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:29,600
their efforts and the future is

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:39,820
empowering them even more with cloud and

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:44,540
AI very powerful well so let's step back

00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:48,050
cloud and AI very powerful right yes

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,260
they can show up even in the most

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:55,610
unexpected applications and they can

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:59,660
empower the noblest of human causes but

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,970
often when we talk about AI we're so

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,490
focused on selling ourselves and the

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,190
rest of the world on the tools

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:11,240
on the algorithms and the technology and

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:16,490
the possibilities but it's more than AI

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,690
it's more than algorithms it's the idea

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,410
that triggered it

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,850
it is a conservationist who's asking why

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,540
can't there be a better way

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,370
it's a technologist who puts that

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,540
together with the most advanced

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:35,200
technology and solves the problem and

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,820
then it is the internet and a cloud and

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,040
data that all make it and machine

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,120
learning that all make it real and

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,870
usable and when all of these comes

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,790
together

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:52,160
AI can make the world a far better place

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:55,520
but it all starts with a question it

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,750
starts with an idea and a passionate

00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:05,269
human being thank you

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,269
