I think the most successful people don't

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,390
look at this as just another bottoms-up

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,190
technology project bringing a new

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,890
database that doesn't really you know

00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,450
drive the level of change invaluable but

00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,440
really thinking about how to leverage it

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,900
especially in the life science

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,609
healthcare industry where you know the

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,009
advent of electronic medical records and

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,480
this really explosion of data you do

00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:24,150
need to think about things differently

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,470
you do need to organize and operate in a

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,300
slightly different pattern I would

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,179
imagine that life sciences - you have a

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,790
lot of privacy and governance and

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,550
security and all these things that have

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,970
to be taken into effect

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,250
do organizations struggle with how to be

00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,230
a more data oriented company with those

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,850
things bearing on that well I think you

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,440
know on top of that most of the clients

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,790
that we talk to now especially in the

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,140
big data space are really looking to

00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,270
move to the cloud so when you think

00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,180
about moving to the cloud there's really

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,700
a whole nother layer of security and

00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,410
privacy and validation challenges that

00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,760
are really new to people that have you

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,430
know or really focused on more of a

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,720
traditional on-premise environment so we

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,190
really help our clients think through

00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,560
you know the different layers of

00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,300
authentication and security and read all

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,440
the policies and procedures that can be

00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,619
and should be put around those

00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,700
environments so with all of your work at

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:18,950
joy and your Health Sciences what do you

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,410
see is the biggest obstacle for an

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,570
organization to actually do data not

00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,880
approve it and want to do it but

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,580
actually start using it and making

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,869
decisions through it I think the one of

00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,729
the most important things that people

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:33,890
will realize on the journey is that it

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,229
takes an ecosystem of vendors to really

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,210
come together and an ecosystem of people

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,920
different skills to really get the value

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,649
out of that so looking at you know a

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,270
data scientist as exactly the diversity

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,800
of technologies and diversity of

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,530
perspectives and a diversity of

00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,490
backgrounds to really drive that value

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,800
statement so if you look at a

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,860
traditional Big Data environment we've

00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,320
got the big data platform

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,390
but many many technologies from all your

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,650
machine learning and AI tools to what

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,970
we're seeing now on cognitive

00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,700
capabilities natural language processing

00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,740
natural language generation from a just

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,450
a pure technology stack but then also

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,429
you know all the different data science

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,929
teams data wrangling as well as those

00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,010
people that can actually translate that

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,010
