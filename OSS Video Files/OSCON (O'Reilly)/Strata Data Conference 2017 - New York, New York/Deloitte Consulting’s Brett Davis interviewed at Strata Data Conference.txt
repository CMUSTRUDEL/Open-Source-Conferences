fantastic event strata is a really

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,009
exciting conference it keeps getting

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,839
bigger every year our clients are really

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,029
embracing the big data in new ways and

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,320
applying it to a real c-suite part of

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:21,090
the business issues which is a bit of a

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,470
change from previous years where it was

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,060
more about the technology now it's about

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,830
the applications and the results our

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,599
clients are getting and the applications

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,220
is are those what everyone's talking

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,689
about AI and machine learning and deep

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,669
learning or are there other things that

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,170
you guys well I think coming up deep

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,030
learning AI machine learning are

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,530
enablers but what's exciting is for

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,120
example in the industry I serve the

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,219
pharmaceutical industry we're actually

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,840
starting to see business outcomes so for

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,160
example in healthcare there's been this

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,989
proliferation this explosion of

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,180
electronic health care data which is now

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,129
helping us answer questions like what

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,960
treatments are working for what patients

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,610
in what context and it will cost which

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,039
are heart of the matter questions that

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,420
are central to 18 percent of the US

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,850
economy and now we're be able to apply

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,309
Big Data technologies to answer some of

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,390
these questions that CEOs of

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,460
pharmaceutical companies are thinking

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,890
about every everyday and is this an easy

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,380
transformation for them to go with big

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,600
data and make decisions based on data or

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,610
is it a a difficult thing for them to

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,869
jump over that barrier now it's a great

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,549
question it's not just about the

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,869
technology so it's easy to say Big Data

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,280
it's easy to say we want to embrace big

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,930
data but there's a lot of factors

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,970
there's new strategies new operating

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,320
models there's cultural changes that

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,210
need to occur as well to think about

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,520
using data differently now that it's

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,229
available to them so it is really of

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,340
course the technology enables it but for

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,960
our clients to get to the outcomes they

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,430
want they really need to wrap it with

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,990
full programs to help with the new

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,579
strategies the new operating models new

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,259
external partnerships new sources of

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,120
data etc to really be successful and

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,700
take advantage of the technology

00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,070
so what if you look at all the partners

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,080
you work with what do you think the the

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,420
gotchas are for most of them there's

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,700
always a few hurdles that they have to

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,130
get over can you identify a couple of

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,670
those so that make it easier for them in

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,320
the future

00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,790
sure yeah I mean the most successful

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,230
clients in embracing Big Data are ones

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,970
that start with strategic clarity from

00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,680
the top when the c-suite really

00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,600
recognizes the importance and drives it

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,430
into the organization and it's not a

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,530
technology bottom-up thing that to me is

00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,280
lesson lesson number one to success is

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,110
really making sure there's

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,340
organizational buy-in and strategic

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,480
clarity of why we're making the

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,520
investments in these new platforms

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,230
technologies and aligning into the

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
business outcomes that that our clients

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,680
