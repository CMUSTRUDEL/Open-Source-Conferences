Title: White Collar Crime Risk Zones Sam Lavigne (The New Inquiry)
Publication date: 2017-09-27
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Sam Lavigne offers an overview of White Collar Crime Risk Zones, a predictive policing application that uses industry-standard predictive policing methodologies to predict financial crime at the city-block level with an accuracy of 90.12%. Unlike typical predictive policing apps, which criminalize poverty, White Collar Crime Risk Zones criminalizes wealth.

so in case you aren't aware pretty good

00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,650
policing apps make predictions about

00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,139
where and when crimes will occur based

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,940
on data about where and when crimes have

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:15,369
already occurred

00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,789
as an example this is the interface for

00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:21,189
an application called hunch lab as you

00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:23,710
can see the software is predicting that

00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:28,150
there's a high likelihood of larceny in

00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,789
the highlighted green square as you

00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:33,310
probably know machine learning

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,050
applications tend to reinforce and

00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,559
reproduce the biases and their training

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,570
data

00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,250
this is particularly dangerous in the

00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:42,910
case of predictive policing because that

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:45,670
data comes from police departments that

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,519
at times could be accused of being

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,680
systemically racist and the risk here of

00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:52,440
course is that it produces a kind of

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,440
feedback loop for over policing

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,030
communities of color so in response we

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,550
decided to make a predictive policing

00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,379
app that uses the same techniques and

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,510
methodologies that real predictive

00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,960
policing apps use but we flip the data

00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:07,420
set

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,750
instead of using data about street crime

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,560
we put in data from from FINRA the

00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,610
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,100
so FINRA is a non-governmental

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:21,010
organization responsible for regulating

00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,600
the financial industry to get our data

00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:25,600
we parsed a bunch of PDFs that look like

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,270
this looking for instances where FINRA

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,750
had find organizations for financial

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,160
malfeasance and then we used a machine

00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,010
learning approach common in predictive

00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,510
policing called risk terrain modeling it

00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,520
generates a model by combining multiple

00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,980
features of a landscape correlated to

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,110
risk in our case we used instances of

00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,970
financial malfeasance density of

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,280
nonprofits liquor stores bars and clubs

00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:54,100
and density of investment advisors and

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,740
this is what we made this is of course a

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,660
map of New York City the rectangles

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,760
indicate locations where our system

00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,580
predicts a high likelihood of

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,470
white-collar crime the redder and darker

00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,470
the square the higher the danger level

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,780
clicking on different squares gives you

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:15,940
more information including what types of

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,000
crimes we believe will occur

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,400
as well as the severity of the crime and

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,210
nearby financial firms that might be

00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:30,130
institutional suspects we also show a

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,580
composite image of a most likely

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,140
individual white-collar criminal suspect

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,690
to make this we did a facial average of

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,970
high-level financial executives who work

00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:47,350
in the area scraping that data from

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:49,420
LinkedIn as you can see every individual

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,130
composite is unique but they all look

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,130
almost exactly the same

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,239
