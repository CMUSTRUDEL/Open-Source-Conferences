hi this is Mike Henrickson from strata

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,420
data in New York I'm here with a she's

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,580
from to wait she's how you doing Larry

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,250
well thank you so we spoke two years ago

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,160
yeah and we spoke mostly about AI and

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,630
cognitive at that time what's changed in

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,690
two years because I think you know

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,520
that's all a long time in technology it

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,930
certainly is and in fact the last time

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,029
we spoke about one of the things that I

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,820
was talking about is you know how some

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,439
of this needs to be mainstream and how

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,710
it has become mainstream it's the real

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,980
story and most people who you know read

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,239
about self-driving autonomous cars

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,059
that's the biggest experiment in AI if

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,820
you ask me right so a car a self-driving

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,680
car pretty much as you know gathering

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,190
all this data and it's making all these

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,020
decisions with relative to a traffic

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,090
light relative to starting shopping

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,629
relative to weather conditions rain

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,500
water whatever it may be and you see

00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:57,960
what they're doing this is they're doing

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,239
this with you know several components of

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,859
next generation technologies right lidar

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,439
for example right it's the next

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,420
generation of radar which gives you 3d

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,460
maps that helps you navigate data and we

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,650
will understand the difference between

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:13,890
different kinds of objects right so if

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,990
you ask me and we saw this for GM's you

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,189
know one point some billion or

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,040
investment in in an AV technology that

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,500
they bought you'll see that these kinds

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,250
of things are beginning to attract money

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,930
from VCS money from OMS and that sort of

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,490
is is the real part of it right so if

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,950
you look at AI and if you look at the

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,909
manifestation of AI especially in

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,710
sectors like automotive you know met

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,150
tech device manufacturers this it Israel

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,770
it's very real

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,110
last time I was giving an example of

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,340
somebody that was you know doing

00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,990
insertable bluetooths is gonna bring it

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,640
to market from the standpoint of you

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,549
know proactive disease monitoring right

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,810
so this is now we are seeing you know

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,000
these things start to happen

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,890
in the real world it's no longer an

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,630
experiment so the real world cuz you

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,969
guys actually work with companies I mean

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,729
this is not research this is actual

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,710
practical in the trenches we're doing

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:08,099
building systems for companies that's

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,009
correct

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,239
and there are kinds of two things going

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,660
on I think in the world there's

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,660
transformation and there's two

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,730
option and the Transformers want to not

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,960
be disrupted they want to get there and

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,730
keep their market share and the

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,450
disruptors want to take that market and

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,780
own it themselves so can you give us

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,210
some examples of the types of in the

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,650
trenches practical stuff that different

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,350
industries are doing because I know you

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:37,930
guys have worked with oil companies all

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,880
the way through finance everything can

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,780
you give us any examples of really good

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,910
use of AI and cognitive now I you know I

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,290
spoke about the eyes and car so we

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,560
answer that to Nissan

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,110
a BMW mercedes-benz down there a very

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,000
entrenched into building autonomous cars

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,980
and we're part of that journey but with

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,340
the Ford the GM's the BMWs in the world

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,870
and if you look at the cognitive side

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,730
right we think of what cognitive is

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,470
actually three things right we talk

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,140
about robotic and process automation

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,400
which is attracting very very big news

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,590
from the standpoint of what it's gonna

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,390
do to transform most people's

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,090
organization and workforces think of

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,680
that as a kind of cognitive which is

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,230
transforming how we do work and it's

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,300
built around the theme or concept of if

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,920
you're gonna do something repeatable mmm

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,270
whether it's a business process or

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,490
something that's rules defined can you

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,800
automate it that's sort of one tranche

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:32,170
of cognitive if you think about a second

00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,630
tranche of cognitive it is around how do

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,490
you enable decision making with the poby

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,070
to algorithms right this is where you

00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,840
see real-world evidence and disease

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,820
management and the things that Watson

00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,930
health is talking about you know how do

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,880
you curate a doctor's you know that way

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,220
to treatment what things that can scan

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,480
journals and and all the other things

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,850
that are happening at breakneck speed

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,500
that's another kind of cognitive and the

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,790
final kind of cognitive is intelligent

00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,770
agents right which we think of as

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,910
cognitive insights right the best

00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:05,650
example is amazonica

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:06,940
an intelligent agent that can filter you

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,650
know the background noise from your

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,850
voice commands to be able to order for

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,130
you to be able to tell whether for you

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,860
to be able to play music for you and

00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,450
these are sort of the these are the

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,459
tranches of what we deal with so if you

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,770
look at any process intensive industry

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,240
whether it's banking or any aspect of it

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,640
they focus on the first bucket

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,830
mainly you know how do I get repeatable

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,590
processes both through BOTS and get

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,080
two efficiencies of scale relative to

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,539
workforce performance the second tranche

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,330
is very oriented towards industries that

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:39,639
are only focused medicine so on so forth

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,680
and the third tranche pretty much is

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,969
consumer centric it's still consumers

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,590
from that centric and not b2b now the

00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:49,719
real question to be asked is does this

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,719
transcend the b2c and echo as a

00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:55,360
technology or a voice command and get

00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:57,310
into the world of b2b we have certain

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,289
hypothesis of a longer conversation but

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,690
I think it's coming

00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,620
so in this field are we now at the point

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,419
of where we're not necessarily

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,810
intelligently predicting the future and

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:13,900
having AI do that for us but we're kind

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,690
of responding to a corpus of what it can

00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,110
learn and respond to are we gonna get to

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:23,379
that point to where AI is going to guide

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,289
us more intelligently like guide us as

00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:29,139
humans into a maybe a safer better

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:31,960
planet I mean is is there a point where

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,669
we get to that point we do in fact there

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,639
is currently a technology that's being

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,129
tested there was a new segment around it

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,650
where they basically are going to embed

00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,089
AI into the decision-making the

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,789
battlefield before you fire a weapon

00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:48,699
now that's an example of you know when

00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,979
is man when is a human cognitive

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:54,639
behavior being overcome by somebody

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,589
that's giving you the data or the next

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,240
action to be taken in a battlefield

00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,690
scenario right this is a real-world

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,339
example of you know can we make things

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,669
intelligent enough to take it to the

00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:08,080
battlefield where it pretty much

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:11,169
determines you know what is the next

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,419
action to be taken I don't think we're

00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,759
very far away from you know those kinds

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:17,349
of applicability of scenarios depending

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,990
upon the sector that we're talking about

00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,969
now how soon it happens how fast has

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,710
happens how ready are we for it right

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:26,259
that's sort of the big the change from

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,210
Las Vegas biggest component of whether

00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,450
we can or cannot do it or would it be

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,900
acceptable to us you know

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,120
in general is to be done but it's going

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,760
excellent so last time we spoke to we

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,610
talked about big data being big data and

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,310
that was the rage at the time because ml

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,530
and AI and all these new technologies

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,990
were kind of on the forefront we're out

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,630
in front of us a little bit these big

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,340
data still really important or it is is

00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:56,310
that the application of it through AI

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,520
and through assisted living and learning

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,500
down the road is that or is gait is

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,790
still really important in here data is

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
still really important I mean big data

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,970
is still very very big for us and the

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,010
reason why big data is still very big

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,680
for us is is for most people to do the

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,440
higher levels of abstraction of AI

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,690
machine learning cognitive doesn't get

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,090
into place until you start to assimilate

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:21,150
this voluminous data where you can do

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,010
these things so where what what has

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,710
happened to a local business is big data

00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,360
has become very very transformative when

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,550
we talk to organizations about the

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,350
investments so if you look at core

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:33,720
platform modernization this is this is

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,240
this is what how we sell big data in the

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,810
marketplace core platform modernization

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,790
is roughly about you know 200 million

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,430
dollars in our portfolio and the reason

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,200
for it to be this sizable is primarily

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,940
because most organizations have come to

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,220
the conclusion that to do this at scale

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,320
they first need to get that data right

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,290
there the processing the assimilation

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,480
the storage in a place where you can do

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,300
an ml and aii the things that we're

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,950
talking about so most people now know

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,930
for a fact that that stuff sort of step

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,340
one at the journey right and most people

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,470
are doing step one on the journey at

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,760
scale knowing step two is within the

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,210
purview of what needs to happen in the

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,280
next 18 to 24 months so I would say Big

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,290
Data and no longer is is a team from the

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,790
standpoint of when we should do it give

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,910
me a roadmap and those things it's like

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,350
this is step one this is table stakes so

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,090
this needs to be in place for me to do

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,430
the other things that most people are

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,130
talking about so how do I get out of my

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,840
siloed you know legacy systems that are

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,729
both in the purview of different

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,680
relational databases and different ERP

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,420
platforms and get it to a place where

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,860
you can start to do these things with it

00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,690
which is the reason why it's such a big

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,550
portfolio service as well so what's

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,870
what's shorten our time period for the

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,010
next time we talked this was two years

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,900
let's talk

00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,390
about if you and I sit down your from

00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,130
now what would you like to say Deloitte

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,890
is doing with your partners in one

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,800
year's time frame with all the data and

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,750
AI and ml that's going on what would you

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,910
like to be doing I think you know if you

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,280
ask me right the scope of services has

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,480
become fairly you know describable in

00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,170
like you know I would say three words

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,820
digital cloud right and to a certain

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,550
extent because it's a different cloud

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,940
how is it enabled by the underpinnings

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:16,800
of big data right so if you if we sit

00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,480
down twelve months from now I think

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,740
there is gonna be no big large

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,690
transformation program within the

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,030
portfolio for services that does not

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,310
touch one other three but all three so

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,500
what I will be able to come back and

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,180
tell you in 12 months is is any client

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,370
that it max embarks in any of these

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,080
journeys there's a digital component to

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,940
it there's a cloud component to it and

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,250
by the way it's being billed for or

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,200
we've spoken about so far so that would

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,670
be a reality excellent actually should

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,240
we look forward that conversation thank

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,240
you thank you

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,330
