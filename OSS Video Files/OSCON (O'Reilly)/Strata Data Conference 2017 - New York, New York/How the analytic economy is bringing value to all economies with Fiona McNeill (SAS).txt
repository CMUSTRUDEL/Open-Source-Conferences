hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,759
data in New York City

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm here with Fiona McNeil from SAS

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,910
how're you doing

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,300
great Mike are you good so what do you

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,030
do at SAS I'm a technology product

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,400
marketer that's ass focusing on the

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,529
cloud and platform technologies and so

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,630
what do you guys see going on here at

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,119
this event that may be different this

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,619
year from prior years there's a lot of

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,130
excitement a lot of excitement that

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,230
frankly is new specifically around

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,780
analytics and for process that makes our

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,989
heart sing and at SAS you guys are

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,809
talking a lot and and socializing the

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,550
economy of everything can you unpack

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,980
that a little bit what is the economy of

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,350
everything mean well the economy of

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,140
everything typically refers to things

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,539
like IOT but there are other economies

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,239
out there there's the API economy the

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,670
big data economy there's the right well

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,010
the IOT and we have one the Tim calls

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,230
the next economy the next economy and at

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,239
SAS we talk about the analytics economy

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,180
okay and can you unpack that a little

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,590
bit what is the analytics economy sure

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,280
they're all these other economies

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:15,060
generate data and there's latent value

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,040
in that data and you can always automate

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,840
data in and of itself but when you do

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,780
that you just make the same thing happen

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,970
faster it's only through analytics they

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,100
can actually make things better so the

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,770
Analects economy is really the fabric

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,360
that's bringing the value out of that

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,400
latent data for all those other

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,229
economies so finding the value finding

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,560
the stories in the data is more as

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,689
important as the data itself it's of all

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,780
the shared data and sharing the insights

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,939
yes okay where each insight becomes a

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,880
data point for the next insight so

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,640
that's probably huge for a lot of

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,130
companies that are trying to transform

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,579
themselves or they're in a state of

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,140
transition going from doing things the

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,350
way they've always done it to be in data

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,329
informed in analytics informed is this

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,229
where you see a lot of action with your

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,149
partners is that they're struggling with

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:11,210
making sense of the data and all the

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,400
different types of data

00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,710
that does continue in in many

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,460
organizations and with our partners as

00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:22,280
well that the data having the data and

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,660
making that shareable is absolutely

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,550
critical and when we look at things like

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,710
GD P R it becomes even more important

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,900
right because there's so many aspects of

00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,090
that personal information across an

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,920
organization but it's also about sharing

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,290
those analytic insights and being able

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,590
to democratize analytics so that they're

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,840
not contained to a very specific few and

00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,480
that anyone who is curious about the

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,690
data has the tools that they need and

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,990
the data they need easily to drive new

00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,490
value from data so in this world we're

00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,260
hurtling towards pretty quickly with AI

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,820
and machine learning deep learning and

00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,100
everything knowing about smart futures

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:04,810
isn't analytics an important step before

00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:09,020
we get there so that we're pointing our

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,610
algorithms had good things that we want

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,160
to investigate rather than just

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,230
everything typically we do need to

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,000
prioritize and there's all kinds of

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,100
reasons to prioritize but one of them

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,960
that's really important is is to ensure

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,280
that you do get the desired results and

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,350
when we talk about some of these more

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,560
advanced algorithms like deep learning

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,570
and cognitive computing to ensure that

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,390
they're producing the results that are

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,370
desired absolutely they need to be

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,900
governed absolutely they you know you

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,810
want to start at a certain place and

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,250
gradually incrementally you know change

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,290
your reinforcement learning and the

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,180
rewards that you're attributing to an

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,160
algorithm that's learning from data is

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,450
it they're also a people and mind shift

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,640
to that's going to need to happen

00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:53,210
because we've heard a few times this

00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:56,420
week about biases if if we're not having

00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:58,760
diverse teams working together and we're

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,860
basing it off analytics that were built

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,290
by three male men 50 years old or

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,990
whatever that their blinders are on that

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,420
are we are we heading down a path to

00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,860
where we have to start thinking about

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,110
humans in the loop making better

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,850
decisions or absolutely that's what it's

00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,530
all about it's well that's what part of

00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,030
it's about anyway humans making better

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,700
decisions but it's also machines making

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,890
better

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,380
so the diversity is absolutely critical

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,080
you know these skill set match ups from

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,970
a domain expertise perspective or with

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,980
different experiences let's say with the

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,160
customer base bringing all of those

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,260
points to bear consistency consistently

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,030
looking at the same data but through

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,220
their analytic lens that makes most

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,770
sense to them is really how we see this

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,720
going excellent so what are some of the

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,240
industries that you guys work with at

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,240
SAS that do you think are moving quick

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,260
and like you know data's been around for

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,460
a while and at least like 7 10 years

00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,310
something like that

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,160
and yet not everyone got on board early

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,830
but some of the early adopters that are

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,780
on board who's moving too quick is not

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,350
necessarily a company but industry wise

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,600
from analytics in general yeah who makes

00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,280
them is a retail making the best use of

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,140
there's some fascinating things

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,790
happening in every industry some of the

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,480
things we've been able to do in retail

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:23,190
is to create virtual realities to enable

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,280
people to immerse themselves and data

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:28,590
and yet collaborate with others that are

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,660
completely remote geographic location

00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,970
there's amazing things happening in

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,650
healthcare where we have worked with

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,570
organizations like Duke Clinical

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,550
Research Institute that are

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:42,060
collaborating with researchers around

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:46,020
the world to drive better results and

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,870
outcomes for cardiovascular patients in

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,240
banking you know being able to working

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,700
with customers to better detect fraud

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,400
anomalies and cyberattacks at you know

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,940
closer to the point of possible

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,620
origination you name it we've we're

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,970
seeing analytics explode and in

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,460
different ways in different industries

00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,780
and in most industries now are going

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,400
through some sort of disruption or

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,320
transformation absolutely through

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,000
analytics and data absolutely most

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,820
organizations and most in most

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,800
industries are seeing direct value from

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,420
analytics where the analytics economy

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,460
becomes a little different is the

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,890
ability to continually compound that

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,660
value driven from analytics so if you

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,050
were to think about one industry that

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,000
that could benefit the most and help the

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,160
most humans on this planet

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,020
where would you put your analytics

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,240
firepower behind which industry that's a

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,010
very difficult question from you know

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,960
we've done we've done some really a

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:47,040
wonderful work with groups and

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,160
organizations that even countries that

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,040
are in dire need after natural disasters

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,710
you know fighting diseases that affect

00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:01,350
people worldwide and if we're going to

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:03,840
be more democratic in our humane humane

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,180
they're absolutely more humane in the

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,340
adoption of analytics I think helping

00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,860
people across the globe

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,110
is is really a wonderful cause excellent

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,780
so if we were to sit down twelve months

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,880
from now what would you like to see SAS

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,130
doing differently than they are today

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,290
and what would you like to see change in

00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,510
the industry in general and the industry

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,210
being data and analytics and where we're

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,320
going

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:33,390
recently I learned that I think it by

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,240
2018 there's going to be it's expected

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:40,229
to be a 12 times increase in public

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,440
api's and I think api's and public api's

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,630
will really help organizations better

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,540
collaborate to compound that value from

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:50,400
specific to analytics so that's one of

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,190
the things I'd really like to see happen

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,900
now seeing that happen requires a whole

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,020
lot of things extremely deep

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,180
understanding of your data lineage

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,940
extremely good governance policies so to

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,979
ensure that you know you're sharing the

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,070
insights that you want compounded with

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,770
the right deep learning

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,000
you know neural net so I think there's a

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,400
lot of considerations in there but I

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,370
think bringing analytics more so two

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,820
more causes and driving more value I

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,590
think api's are going to be a very great

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,210
way for us to do that excellent well

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,590
Fiona we look forward that conversation

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,590
twelve months thank you take it

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,260
