	Wild, wild data: Adventures with big data and the IoT in the Angolan highlands

New York-based artist and educator Jer Thorp is an adjunct professor in New York University’s ITP program and a member of the World Economic Forum’s Network on AI, IoT, and the Future of Trust. Previously, Jer ran the Office for Creative Research, a multidisciplinary research group exploring new modes of engagement with data, and served as the data artist in residence at the New York Times. Jer is a former geneticist, and his digital art practice explores the many-folded boundaries between science and art. Jer’s award-winning software-based work has been exhibited in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America, including in the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, and has recently been featured by the Guardian, Scientific American, the New Yorker, and Popular Science. Jer is a National Geographic fellow and 2015 was named by Canadian Geographic as one of Canada’s greatest explorers.

	00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,069
over the last six years I built a lot

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,320
more with my collaborators of these

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:12,860
kinds of tools this is a tool called EXO

00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,859
which is a spacial exploratory space for

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,560
Kepler data or this tool called convene

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:21,679
which is a interactive tool for

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,730
exploring how meetings occur over very

00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,769
large organizations or this one called

00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,349
specimen box which is a tool

00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:32,840
specifically designed to analyze

00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:36,590
extremely large botnets extremely large

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,970
criminal botnets now all these tools

00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,310
have the same things in common they're

00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,740
exploratory tools and and they're kind

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:45,530
of built to put somebody in the position

00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:48,440
of being able to drive through the data

00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,910
terrain now I've come to realize that

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,620
these tools have a lot in common with

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,930
something that was built in the MIT in

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,030
the late 1970s this is a project called

00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,710
data land which is kind of an obscure

00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,630
project you might not have heard of it

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,480
before but the idea was this was a

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,460
control center for somebody to sit

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,229
actually it's a it's a designer it's an

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:08,719
Eames chair you'd sit in your Eames

00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:11,420
chair and using touchscreens and a

00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,140
windowed interface in 1979 you'd be able

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:16,310
to explore various data sets so one of

00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,350
the things that I think we did pretty

00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,960
well with these exploratory tools is

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,450
that we took advantage of of this kind

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,429
of idea of putting somebody in the

00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,229
driver's seat letting them get into the

00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:30,109
data in ways that that were driven by

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,579
their own personal narrative the thing

00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,899
that I think we did badly was the same

00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,819
thing I think data line does badly

00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,069
there's there's a reason why data line

00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:40,069
looks like Star Trek right why it looks

00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:42,079
like a seat on the bridge and that's

00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:44,210
because the operator of this thing was

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,209
not meant to be on the planet they were

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:50,420
meant to be away from the data up there

00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:52,340
in orbit analyzing without really having

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,799
to be too concerned about what was going

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,530
on at the planet below in data I think

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,389
we have this kind of strange prime

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,029
directive built on objectivity that

00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:04,459
tells us that our job is to stay away

00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:07,039
from the data sources our job is to look

00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:09,020
at them from afar and in my case I

00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,640
realized that this was problematic and I

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,939
realized that it was making it so that I

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,130
wasn't doing my job as well as I could

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:18,800
so what I did is I decided to swim

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,350
upstream against this data pipeline

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,210
current that we're all in and I wanted

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,040
to get as close to collection as I could

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,920
so I wanted to get to that place where

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,100
data became data that kind of rich dark

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,100
soil of data becoming a thing

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,349
