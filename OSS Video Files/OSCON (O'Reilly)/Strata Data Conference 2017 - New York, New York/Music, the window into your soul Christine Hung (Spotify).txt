as you can imagine as Spotify we talk

00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,080
about music a lot and it is inevitable

00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:15,019
that people ask the question who are

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,320
your favorite artists note that it's

00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:20,240
often a trick question because people

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,039
are waiting to judge you based on your

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,100
answers so if you ask me that question

00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,050
this will be my official answer I'm

00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,530
going to tell you that I'm really into

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,680
Latin music I like Manu Cholula who is a

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:39,350
famous Spanish punk rock artist I like

00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,200
Maurice amante who is famous for her

00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,170
bust Nova tracks I'm also gonna say that

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,480
I am really into Jack Johnson Jack is my

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,960
go-to when I just need some chill music

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,410
in the background and finally of course

00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,739
I'm gonna say that I love Madonna the

00:00:53,410 --> 00:01:00,170
fabulous talented feminist icon and this

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,539
all sounds good because it fits the type

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,610
of image that I want in front of my

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:07,280
colleague I want people to think that

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm a serious music fan I know what I

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,479
want and I'm not affected too much by

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:17,119
the pop culture but if you look at what

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,890
I actually listen to it's a very

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,049
different story so let's just take my

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,210
streaming history in the last six months

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,990
and that's look at the top three most

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,670
stream artists from my Spotify account

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:34,009
the number three artists here as you can

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,750
see is manu chao right so I was telling

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,540
the truth

00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:42,970
guess who the second most streamed

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:47,840
artist is does anyone know who this is

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:51,439
it's not Madonna okay so this is paulina

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,590
Rubio she's a very famous Mexican pop

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,899
singer and this is as mainstream as you

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,719
can get and as one of my friends said

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:02,990
she is like the Britney Spears of Latin

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,149
music so this will be something that I

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,939
would not talk I would not want to talk

00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,729
about in front of my colleagues because

00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:12,770
it doesn't fit the image that I want so

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,650
now you know how this goes can anyone

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,440
guess who is the most stream artist on

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,120
my Spotify accounts

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,310
any guesses is it Justin Bieber or is it

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,110
Taylor Swift

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:34,120
the reality is I don't even know who

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:37,910
that is this is what I stream the most

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,890
if you have kids you know why this is

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,650
this is the track that I stream the most

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,230
so let's just pause for a second and

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,340
think about what's happening here what

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,110
this is me obviously now you learn that

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,020
perception is not reality right we all

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,670
have little secrets that we want to keep

00:02:53,020 --> 00:03:01,670
but what else have you learned about me

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:06,170
I mean you can probably tell that I have

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:10,700
a baby in my belly up here but do you

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:14,360
think I stream the wheels on the bus 792

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,930
times in the last six months just so

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,900
that this baby can memorize the lyrics

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:24,470
probably not right you can probably very

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:27,940
confidently guess that I am already a

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,459
mother and I have a toddler at home

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:34,970
who's obsessed with the wheels on the

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,880
bus okay so now you know how this works

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,489
and as you can imagine because music

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,459
reveals so much about the audience

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:46,610
whether you like it or not as Spotify

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:50,800
we're now beginning to explore what we

00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,800
can predict about people

00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,220
