	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hi this is Mike Hendrickson from strata

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,220
dated in New York I'm here with Thomas

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,470
from cloud era Thomas how you doing I'm

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,220
doing all right so how's the event been

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,320
for you so far

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,030
that's been great I've been wall-to-wall

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,429
what with customer meetings

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,260
presentations catching up with people

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,699
you know the whole the whole favori

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,830
thing you do at a show like this and

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,150
what do you do with cloud era what is

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,519
your role I'm the director of product

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,029
marketing for caldera data science that

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,119
means I evangelize write publish work

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,719
with work with sales reps work with

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,570
customers helping customers understand

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,090
what you know what products Club Dara

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,079
has and how we can help customers with

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,700
data science and data science is a term

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,620
that's a little bit different from data

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,239
but there's more more behind it so can

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,300
you talk about what are the newest

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,120
trends in data science sure well data

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,690
science itself is a relatively new field

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,059
and we work with what we call open data

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,369
science in other words there is a strong

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,890
trend in the business for people who are

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,170
doing predictive analytics advanced

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,000
analytics and so forth they use open

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,670
source tools and these people tend to

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,500
call themselves data scientists the open

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,990
source tools are things like R and

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,030
Python and Scala and SPARC and all the

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,270
the great stuff that we talk about here

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,979
at the strategy in the show what makes

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,200
it you know what are the key trends

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,189
right now well first of all open data

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,729
science itself is gaining an increasing

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:39,000
share of the total volume of analytics

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,790
work in most enterprises so roll back 10

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,820
years most organizations use commercial

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,220
tools today they have a typically in

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,560
large enterprises a mix of commercial

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,780
and open data science so it's simply the

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,950
trend towards open tooling itself and is

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,930
number one second is the explosion of

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,899
interest in deep learning deep learning

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,820
is a specific method a specific kind of

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,549
machine learning method for things like

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,039
image recognition speech recognition

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,069
handwriting recognition or all these are

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,319
exploding and every organization

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:16,560
generally has applications for deep

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,540
and every organization we talked to is

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,420
at least getting started with deep

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,989
learning and some are quite advanced so

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,719
data science in organizations it's

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:30,150
pretty much everywhere most enterprises

00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,970
have some sort of data science office or

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,310
or people employed as data scientists

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,290
sure nowadays if you were to advise a 20

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,569
year old in college what should they

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,980
come prepared to do what should they be

00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,939
doing in college to prepare themselves

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,819
surely a data scientist okay so let's

00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:53,159
look at the kinds of characteristics the

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,739
companies look for in their entry level

00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,379
data scientists so there's no

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,359
certification right and there are now

00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,310
some colleges that are granting degrees

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,400
in data science but as with everything

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,220
else people wonder you know how good is

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,530
that credential right so if i were

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,280
hiring a young person right at a college

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,709
I would look for some indication that

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,879
that person is interested in engaging

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,400
with data and drawing insights from data

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,500
right now it doesn't matter what your

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,799
major is you can major in physics or

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,859
anthropology or gender studies or French

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
language but English English I mean it

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:36,150
doesn't really matter what your your

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,090
major is there are opportunities to work

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,479
with data and the use data science tools

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:45,090
and and universities create these

00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,519
opportunities every student nowadays

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,849
does some kind of a project a hands-on

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,989
project so I would look for someone who

00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:58,079
has taken the initiative to learn R or

00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:00,030
Python or another open source data

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,069
science tool that they've actually

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,829
engaged with data in one or more

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:08,129
projects and that they are they're

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:10,590
excited about it right that is morph and

00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:13,169
I mean all of that is more important

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,549
than whatever they took this course or

00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,829
that course or whether they had that

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,289
major if you've engagement data if you

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,500
draw an insight and you like it then you

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,180
probably have a career in data science

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,310
excellent is that helpful yes it is so

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,560
which let's now move to the career

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,960
what what are the things that a data

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,060
scientists can do the most to help their

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,460
company prepare themselves for the

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:42,389
future one is to stay current on the on

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:45,389
the the most innovative tools in data

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,830
science today so right now that's deep

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:51,330
learning

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:54,540
gartner predicts that by 2018 80% of all

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,280
data scientists will have data so

00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,350
they'll have deep learning in their

00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,970
toolkit as the way Gartner describes it

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,610
my sense is that's optimistic 2018 isn't

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,430
that far away right and from speaking

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,320
with customers we typically find that if

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,080
an organization has a hundred data

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,479
scientists there are a handful that are

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,150
currently actively working with with

00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,610
deep learning but for someone working in

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,260
data science today learning and coming

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,210
to grips with deep learning learning how

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,820
to understand it and use it that's

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,070
critical there are many different deep

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,520
learning frameworks tensorflow as

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,919
popular Kerris is popular it doesn't

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,750
matter that much which framework you

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,850
learn as long as you come to grips with

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,039
the technique itself so that's the first

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,780
thing the other thing that every data

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,820
scientist has to understand is that

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:48,240
ultimately this is about driving

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,000
business value right and typically the

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,430
most the most highly paid data

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,870
scientists are those that work with

00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:01,110
business stakeholders and are able to

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,300
take a business framework which might

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,039
you know a business opportunity or a

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,530
business problem which might be simply

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,450
as we need to increase sales or we need

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:11,729
to cut costs and then work through the

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,160
process of figuring out how the data

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:17,760
science tools can address that problem

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,530
right those are ultimately the the data

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,389
scientists who can do that consistently

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,520
and successfully are the ones that rise

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,010
to the top of the profession excellent

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,950
so Thomas if you and I sit down twelve

00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,160
months from now what would you like to

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:34,320
see data science have been applied to

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,330
during that 12 months to change

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,180
something significant

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:41,819
in the world what what is it we could

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,919
tackle with data science you know it's

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,930
it's it's a tough question only because

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,970
there's so many things that are being

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:50,039
tackled right now right aren't as well

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,409
so just within the past month

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,810
researchers at Stanford revealed that

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,300
with deep learning they can diagnose

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,190
heart disease from an electrocardiogram

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,259
more effectively than cardiac you 'men

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,970
cardiologists can do that's a great

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,210
thing all right

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,479
the insurance industry is able to very

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,400
quickly assess claims from a

00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,419
catastrophic event a tornado or

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,490
hurricane just from images right so you

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:20,190
name the problem all right you name the

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,229
health problem now it's not a magic beam

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,580
deep learning and data science are not

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,590
going to solve every problem in the

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,690
world but you name a problem there's

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,240
probably something the data science can

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:33,590
do to help excellent we look forward to

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,590
that journey with you thank you

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,860
