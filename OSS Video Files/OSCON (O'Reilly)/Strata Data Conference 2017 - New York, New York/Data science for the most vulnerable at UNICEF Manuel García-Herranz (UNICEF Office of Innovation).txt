Description: 
	Data science for the most vulnerable at UNICEF Innovation
Manuel García-Herranz (UNICEF Office of Innovation)

In a world more connected and digitalized than ever, the steadily growing availability of data—along with the advances in fields such as data science, complex systems, artificial intelligence, and computational sociology—has profoundly changed businesses such as marketing and advertising and revolutionized related areas such as political campaigns or governance. Manuel García-Herranz explains how to leverage these advances for the most vulnerable, while making sure that the existing data divide does not increase the gap in inequality, and integrate these advances into the humanitarian and development systems.
