Description: 
	Data science for the most vulnerable at UNICEF Innovation
Manuel García-Herranz (UNICEF Office of Innovation)

In a world more connected and digitalized than ever, the steadily growing availability of data—along with the advances in fields such as data science, complex systems, artificial intelligence, and computational sociology—has profoundly changed businesses such as marketing and advertising and revolutionized related areas such as political campaigns or governance. Manuel García-Herranz explains how to leverage these advances for the most vulnerable, while making sure that the existing data divide does not increase the gap in inequality, and integrate these advances into the humanitarian and development systems.

	00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,979
so we started working in the Ebola

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,930
crisis in 2014 in West Africa and this

00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:11,759
is cereal Sierra Leone and this is a

00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:15,089
place where there is no data lakes there

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,770
is just basically lakes so how can we

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,470
know how people move in a place like

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,090
this one so in this case we set up a

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,980
partnership with some colleagues of ours

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,130
from global poles so with the government

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,190
and with a telco and said well you know

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,620
that people make calls in your in your

00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,210
company so you can basically compute an

00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,740
aggregate all that data and tell me how

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,600
many people have made a phone call in

00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,980
this part of the country and later on

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,410
make a phone call somewhere else and

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,780
that is one aggregation that one percent

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,079
of the information allow us to know for

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,180
example that the the people from CAFO

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,010
Boulogne which was an outbreak used to

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,930
take the South route to go to the

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,489
capital and therefore a better way to

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,100
place resources such as temperature

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,100
controls information campaigns in the

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,590
place that is most needed now this data

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,630
also allows to us to look at the world

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,979
in a different way so for example we can

00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,069
look at Sierra Leone not from an

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,850
administrative perspective of

00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:11,939
municipalities and counties and

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,590
districts not from a ethnic map that is

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,689
probably 15 years old and no longer

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,179
valid but looking at the country from

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,549
what areas people travel more between

00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:25,319
them than they travel outside and that

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,090
that is there is a big big thing for

00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,490
understanding if I put a health centre

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,840
in here will it give coverage naturally

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,389
to the plate to the people in these

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,630
communities or these other communities

00:01:32,389 --> 00:01:39,509
so of course after Ebola there were many

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,329
other outbreaks and we keep working on

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,450
that so Sica there was another outbreak

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,459
in Congo but the truth is that it isn't

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,499
easier to set up these collaborations

00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,420
once the outbreak and the emergency is

00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:53,459
out in the media and if we wait for that

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,079
point by the time the systems are in

00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:56,579
place the data is being collected it's

00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,529
already too late for action so one of

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,539
the big challenges that we have is how

00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:02,819
can we prepare for this to happen how

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:06,319
can we set up the necessary partnerships

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:06,319
and systems ahead of time

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,530
