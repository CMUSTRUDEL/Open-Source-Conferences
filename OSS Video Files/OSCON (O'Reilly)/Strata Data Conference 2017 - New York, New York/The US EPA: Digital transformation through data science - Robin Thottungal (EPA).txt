	00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,890
you know all these scenarios what you

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,140
have to realize is just by showing this

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,730
thing and comparing it to the pictures

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,860
that I showed you it's very difficult

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,580
for somebody to say that okay you know

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,350
okay these are incidents that does not

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,090
seem to have any big picture problem

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,020
right so why should I care coffee beans

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,150
okay I'll drink tea right or forests are

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,600
going down that's fine we will reforest

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,460
it right the question is I think what I

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,410
would like to ask this community is and

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,470
being the data science and data-driven

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,750
community are we getting to a point

00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,590
where we need to create a think about a

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,160
new document which is more data-driven

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:48,590
right now when I say that again I'm

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,540
gonna share two videos of what I think

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:57,360
community and members like you can he'll

00:00:51,540 --> 00:01:01,079
just tell the success stories so what

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,340
you're looking at there is the plot of

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,899
the temperature change that has happened

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,670
almost almost a century right and the

00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:10,799
power of this visualization is just by

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,060
looking at that visualization most of us

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,950
will agree on the fact that the

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,130
temperature of the globe has gone up on

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,100
the average in the last 100 years and it

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,740
has almost gone up to 1.5 degrees right

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,359
same thing nASA has the information nor

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,209
has the information but the person who

00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,729
did the visualizer and took the data and

00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:35,009
presented in a way that easy for anybody

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:37,380
do you understand this is another

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,899
animation that I took from NASA where it

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,359
shows how the Arctic ice has shifted

00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:44,609
over the course of I think 60 years and

00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,689
you can see that just by watching the

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:51,389
video when it gets to 2012

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,759
it has shrunk right so I think as a

00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:55,740
public sector servant my request and my

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,840
asked for the communities I would

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,539
encourage you guys to start looking at

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,819
the data that we have and start thinking

00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,319
about how can we tell the story in a

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:09,840
fashion that will help us as a as a

00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:12,090
planet and as a as a species to tell

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,379
what is happening to us now and what

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,379
should we do to prevent it

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,709
