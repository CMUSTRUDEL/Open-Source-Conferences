one of the many reasons why people like

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,530
to work in the Silicon Valley

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,980
it's the exceptional perks among them

00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:13,290
the great food offered at its cafeterias

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,420
our exhibit one is Google and I believe

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,119
our previous speaker Chad could attest

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,890
this for a fact

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,109
Google's cafeterias offers wide variety

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,089
of food and sensibly for a tech company

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,019
whose core business is cooking up

00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:30,269
algorithms rather than carrots the

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,149
complete use is to outsources cafeterias

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,000
and let the chefs do the cooking some of

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,230
it world-class

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,300
predictably the arrangement results in

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,460
great food Google concentrates on out

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,320
what it's good at and leave everything

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,440
else to the experts our exhibit too is

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,010
stripe stripe as a company accepts

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,559
online and and payments for mobile apps

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,660
they handle billions of dollars every

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,749
year for forward-looking businesses

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:03,059
around the globe but when it comes to

00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:05,010
its cafeterias it chooses to remain

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,650
traditional and keeps its operations

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:10,560
in-house now I ever never eaten at a

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,180
stripe cafeteria but I believe if attack

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,790
you bruised your coffee it can get a

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,730
little technical so given there are no

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,240
experts in cafeterias and outsourcing is

00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,180
easy

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,820
why would stripe decide to keep its food

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:29,910
corner in-house well because it's not

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:31,950
really about the coffee stripes main

00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,260
product is the mobile micro payments

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,540
paying for food and drinks is what's the

00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,940
most important use case for this

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,620
platform especially for professionals

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,250
who spends a lot of time going and

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:48,180
drinking coffee presumably true for 700

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,280
plus stripes employees so every time a

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,070
striper takes a break and goes to the

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,010
cafeteria to get a coffee he or she gets

00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,380
to experience the stripe product now

00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,810
given the fact that the cafeteria is

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,710
in-house the seller side also gets to

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,200
experience the product so the in-house

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,289
cafeteria actually acts like a user

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,310
experience lab thus augmenting the line

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,370
of business for stripe

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,370
