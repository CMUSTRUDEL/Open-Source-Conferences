Title: A whole new way to think about your next-gen applications Anil Gadre (MapR)
Publication date: 2017-09-27
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	If youâ€™re struggling to build applications that harness all of your data, you also likely find it a challenge to gather the data in real time, build intelligent models, and reliably deploy them at scale in production as part of mission-critical business applications. Classic relational databases are unable to handle modern data intensive workloads, and NoSQL databases canâ€™t provide the breadth of capabilities required for diverse enterprise applications.

Anil Gadre explains how customers using a converged data platform are succeeding at creating breakthrough new apps for the enterprise. Converged capabilities ranging from cloud-scale data stores to powerful databases and integrated persisted streaming create new possibilities for enterprise developers looking to architect, develop, and deploy applications that were impossible until now.

This keynote is sponsored by MapR.

	00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,700
thank you everybody for coming we're

00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,950
proud sponsors of this event and I hope

00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,340
you get what you came for and hopefully

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,550
even more than that if you know about

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:19,560
Knapp our you know that we are a company

00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:23,189
about all data one platform every cloud

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,810
the last time I key noted strata I

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,609
basically spent the first the previous

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,019
six months or so talking to a lot of

00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:31,239
customers going hey I've got to do this

00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:33,130
keynote you have advice for the audience

00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:35,350
and that's and that's basically what I'm

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,210
gonna do again today which is in the

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:39,309
last six months or so talking to a lot

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,190
of customers around the world collecting

00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:44,739
up you know kind of the most interesting

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,629
five or six pieces of advice and stories

00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:49,239
and insights and hopefully you'll find

00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,670
that that will be useful to you now I

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,739
guess I one of the the highest level

00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,249
things I've realized in the last year is

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,109
that people are thinking about data and

00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:01,269
their enterprise use of these

00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:03,249
technologies in a bigger way so I'm

00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,590
gonna start by saying you know I I

00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:08,890
actually think it's time for you to to

00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:11,380
think bigger right about data now what

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,990
do I mean by that that means that big

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:17,230
data across the world is really breaking

00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:19,960
out from the the experiments or or

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,810
writing the maturity curve into people

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,570
starting to think about much larger uses

00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,100
of data in the enterprise and so as the

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,680
theme of the show today is you know make

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,710
data work I'm getting asked the question

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,390
how do I win with data what do I have to

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,400
do to get ahead of my competition how do

00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,060
I really apply the data in a much

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,190
broader way so this this talk today is

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:44,500
all about sharing with you the

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:48,070
approaches that I see customers taking

00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:50,350
and using really the techniques and

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,660
tools in an interesting way so let me

00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,460
start first with streaming right so

00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,250
streaming often sort of is like well

00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,800
that's that IOT thing right well when we

00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:02,980
rolled out the ability to persist

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,580
streams have billions of topics millions

00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:09,550
of streams but persisted one customer an

00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,890
early adopter basically observed oh I

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,680
can now treat the stream as a system of

00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,580
record III it's not just my old days if

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,040
you know my coracle they

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,440
my system of record and that radically

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,560
changed what they started to do with

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,450
streaming the other unintended

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,660
consequence that wasn't really planned

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,540
for was they figured out that now you

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,390
don't have to rely on old-style broker

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,640
based messaging architectures to create

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,040
global applications that are dealing

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,270
with kind of incoming data so streaming

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,340
is important obviously for more

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,950
real-time but the fact that you can

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,620
actually act scale with millions of

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,480
streams that are persistent be able to

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,510
to create micro services based

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,040
applications really changed how agile

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,750
people started becoming in fact one

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,280
customer has taught in the telecoms

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,890
business said that they've taken them

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,230
went to tenth the amount of code to get

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,940
applications up and running the other

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,890
ones an interesting one which is ml AI

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,230
is obviously a hot topic everywhere

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,260
right I had a customer a few weeks back

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,600
saying our strategy is to make every one

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,350
of our applications a little bit smarter

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,820
every year so ml AI in the mind of this

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,040
customer wasn't about a Big Bang

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,989
approach it was more about kind of

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,989
steadily applying it over the course of

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:28,690
time as the organization gets more

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:30,550
mature at the tools the technologies but

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,340
by the way thinking about applying it on

00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,239
a very broad way across the enterprise

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,130
business processes and the applications

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,440
the next is an interesting one right

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,110
edge always people go well IOT again

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,810
right not true this is a case in which

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,180
the edge may be far more important to

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,030
the enterprise and the reason is is

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,640
because the in one case that simple cost

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,800
of back hauling data all day long is

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,750
getting to be too high and people are

00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,530
rethinking the architecture so that you

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:05,019
can have localized processing

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,269
centralized learning and and Ted Dunning

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,209
our chief application architect loves to

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:12,250
say that right act local learn global

00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,500
now this is not possible

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,200
if the underlying technology does not

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,750
automatically know how to create a

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,940
fabric meaning the clusters have to be

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,830
able to connect to each other seamlessly

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,690
transport data without human

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,610
intervention and that's really the

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,230
secret to being able to create these

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,760
very powerful

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,260
Rick's right and I think by the way

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,840
people are gonna have many cranes of

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,760
fabrics an edge fabric applique an

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,890
application fabric many kinds of fabrics

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,380
that really are able to be possible

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,860
because the underlying technology knows

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,900
how to make that seamless so speaking of

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,360
fabrics that's a term that's very widely

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:52,600
used in the storage space sometimes I

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,910
think that term is getting redefined as

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,340
I talked to people who are pretty far

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,290
down the maturity curve with data and

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,990
analytics and they're starting to think

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,450
about much more enterprise wide global

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,790
strategies they're realizing that they

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,520
actually have to have a multi cloud

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:11,410
strategy in fact one customer just I

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,480
mean they flat out said I'm getting

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,060
locked into one cloud provider we don't

00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,480
like it we can't be and so they are all

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:21,600
searching for a multi cloud strategy

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,670
including their own data centers again

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,770
it's it's a kind of primal importance to

00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,990
be able to have the underlying system be

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,870
able to connect and create these fabrics

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:34,140
that that provide global namespace which

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,250
our technology happens to do and

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,100
transparent ability to create these

00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,980
global fabrics so what I see is I

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,560
actually see a very deliberate attempt

00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,810
at any directed attempt on the part of

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,210
many customers who are starting to creep

00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,300
think bigger and think enterprise-wide

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,470
about how they're gonna not just

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,690
incorporate these tools and techniques

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,660
into small things but really on a much

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,970
grander scale and and that's again why

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,670
this notion of you know kind of all your

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,420
data not just your big data connecting

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:09,820
to legacy and future comes in now what

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,630
happens with other customers is the

00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:15,670
following you get analytics check my

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,800
problem now is how do I actually apply

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,870
those analytics and in that's the case

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,030
where because the database is where the

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,950
business apps really run and so here's a

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,480
really good one right gossamer said to

00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,300
me the real advantage is gonna come from

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:31,710
a database that can do analytics and

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:33,610
operations in the same database not too

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,920
transferring data between each other

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,930
that's that's kind of no more than the

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,120
old way of throwing analytics over the

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,620
wall to the operations people right so

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,120
what are these people trying to build

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,680
well these are cat

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,040
Tech's are building these incredibly

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,600
rich environments engaging if you can't

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,850
engage you're never gonna actually sell

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,010
anything to anybody right if it's not

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,260
real time you're gonna lose that that

00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,740
moment in which you're going to be able

00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,169
to engage those people and you might

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,210
have a really creative app but it's not

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:06,490
gonna actually be able to operate at the

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,530
speed and the scale that the inner part

00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:11,050
modern enterprise really needs and and

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,229
this is where I'm finding that beyond

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:17,350
Big Data people we are now starting to

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:20,260
talk much more to application architects

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,479
who are thinking in in about these kinds

00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,699
of larger problems applying these tools

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,770
and techniques into mainstream business

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,150
processes and so if there was a wish

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,370
list if you know what's what's wrong

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,110
with the databases well the problem is

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,120
this frustration with you know why can't

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,340
I get all this why can't I get you know

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,380
multi-model why can't I get you know

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,990
deep integration with MLM AI and

00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,389
ultimately it kind of lands in the space

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,070
of well you know mangoes can't

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:49,180
scale and Cassandra's not consistent

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:51,789
enough for me so yesterday we introduced

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,910
the sixth version of our database which

00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:57,820
which is is the most scalable JSON

00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,000
document database and it's able to do

00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,669
in-place analytics and operational apps

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,099
in the same database now this is again

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:08,320
part of our platform right because

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:11,380
there's cloud scale data store the

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,320
database events streaming all persisted

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,630
and the ability on a global basis to

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,610
create fabric seamlessly without without

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,710
you having to do anything these fabrics

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,099
happen to naturally create with these

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,090
clusters connecting to each other so I

00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,580
would tell you that one of the most

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:32,320
central realizations is after your past

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,450
big data come apps and apps require a

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,060
database that actually is a modern

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,419
database that can actually do analytics

00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:42,459
and operations in the same one some

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,250
great customer examples ranging from

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:47,470
Pontus intelecom to the country of india

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,620
doing using this database for for

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,320
nationwide biometric authentication

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,360
sales comp with exactly samsung zing and

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,279
a fortune 100

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,370
national services company which doesn't

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,620
want to be named here today and so so

00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,870
ultimately you know what we're finding

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,970
is when we talk about convergence and

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:10,660
the importance of convergence it's it's

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:12,250
it's because the new apps need all these

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,829
different capabilities coming together

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,019
in a way that can create these fabrics

00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:19,420
so I believe what you're gonna be able

00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:22,269
to do is basically more interesting

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,880
things more clever features and

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,370
hopefully do them with with less effort

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,050
right because ultimately I mean what do

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,899
we all want to do we want to compromise

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,720
lessen everything in our lives so I'm

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,730
also pleased to announce that c3 IOT who

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,910
is a company that's that creates tools

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:42,640
and and platform for creating mln AI

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,610
apps has chosen our map our platform to

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,029
speed up how you can create ml AI based

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,430
apps

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:51,040
they've been historically only in cloud

00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,589
now they can actually do hybrid on-prem

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,170
and in cloud and they're gonna be in our

00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:57,970
booth so come by and check that out you

00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,949
can also get book signed Ted and Ellen

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:03,070
have written a book on model management

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:04,990
in the world of ml Jim Scott with micro

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,149
services and containers and we've got a

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,839
really cool music match demo that's

00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:14,680
written on this map our database 6.0 so

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,209
stop by come ask us you know how can I

00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,519
win with data and let's talk about how

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,230
we can help you win with data all right

00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,720
thank you very much for being here

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,579
I hope that's useful in your journey of

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,910
big data and see you next year

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:30,600
all right thank you

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,600
