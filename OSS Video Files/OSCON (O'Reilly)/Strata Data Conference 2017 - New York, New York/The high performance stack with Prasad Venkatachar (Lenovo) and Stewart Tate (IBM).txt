hi this is Mike Henrickson Australia day

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,600
day in New York City I'm here with

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,150
Rashad from Lenovo and Stuart from IBM

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,340
Prashad how is this event been for you

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,340
it's pretty good a lot of excitement um

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,850
this is Lenovo major conference for big

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,310
data so what we are at Lenovo data

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,830
center group so we have server soul

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,930
storage networking and we work with all

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,119
the major ISPs in the big data space and

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,730
what we build called a certified

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,380
reference architecture and in addition

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,420
to reference architecture we got

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,329
something unique solutions which we work

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,500
with the partners like IBM so I want to

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,120
introduce Stuart 8 for our you know f1

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,040
solution is the chief data designer from

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,739
IBM so he's going to talk through about

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,539
that solution for one solution which was

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,180
sort you go then how is the audience

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,820
been this week here for you guys this is

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,230
a good audience for you yeah they're

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,420
they want to know what Lenovo is

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,489
offering in the big data space and some

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,010
of the solutions what you know what they

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,350
want so on the big deal especially we

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,270
have unique solutions that no other

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,130
Hardware ender is kind of offering that

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,290
and this is something unique to the

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,229
industry's solving something real-time

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,619
problems real customer problems that is

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,720
pretty exciting

00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,820
different offerings in the booth here to

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,790
conditionally right okay so what what

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,710
are you showing people around here so we

00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,420
are showing up a certified reference

00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,820
architecture what we ship it as an

00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,880
integrated system in smack stagnant

00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,939
cable and that is a virtual rack that's

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,860
uses in SR 650 it is the foundation for

00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:37,240
our big data reference architecture in

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,130
addition to that we have a cloud

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,189
reference architecture right behind the

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:45,340
screen and this is a a map R and s AP

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:51,100
partner solution and here is we have a

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:55,270
IBM informix partner solution you call

00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,729
it f1 we call it f1 what is that one so

00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:02,080
there's a reason for that because it's

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:06,009
fast it is exceptional so we did

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:10,239
something special here we took a very

00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:13,930
difficult problem you know handling

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,830
hundreds of billions of rows hundreds of

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,380
terabytes of data we not only put the

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:23,980
best hardware to bear with our partners

00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:27,070
at Lenovo and Intel well being brought

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:31,720
the best software to their technology

00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,609
from IBM and Hortonworks to deliver

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,140
something exceptional so you have a

00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:38,560
metal stack and you have a software

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,359
stack oh yeah yeah exactly right and

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,579
they're both high performance and they

00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:44,579
are both high performance and when you

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:46,270
put them together you get something

00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,190
exceptional

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,930
what are the types of industries or

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,190
companies that are going to be adopting

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:57,430
these really pipe highly performant we

00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:00,910
customers in financials and insurance in

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:04,360
retail in fact the example we give on

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:07,930
the f1 compares the date of volumes in

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,040
our test to Amazon one of the largest

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,410
retailers in the world so we took a very

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,200
challenging workload with our partners

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,180
we didn't know if we'd be successful or

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,050
not and we climbed that mountain

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,330
together and here's a solution so we're

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,220
here to share it with people and it's

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,930
pretty exciting and what are people

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,510
saying when you show them and they're

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,750
they're a little shocked and surprised

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,800
that you can take a dupe and spark with

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:42,600
that much data and get those faster

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,790
results the f1 is literally five times

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,780
faster than the traditional Hadoop or

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,580
spark cluster and because I'm from

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,240
California it's gotta save energy

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,330
so it uses all state-of-the-art

00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,910
components from Lenovo from Intel that

00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,630
now save energy and give you higher

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,660
performance and is this available now

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:13,490
yes and how do people find it well they

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:16,820
can contact our friends at Lenovo ok or

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,160
we've got we've got our own little web

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,270
app where you can go out and run your

00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:27,350
own queries against the f1 cluster so

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,540
you go to f1 Big Data comm select one of

00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,150
the 99 queries that you'd like to run

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,780
against 100 terabytes and it gives you

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,970
the performance results Wow so that's

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,370
where people can find out more where do

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,940
you guys see this partnership going in

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,160
the future what what is the future of

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,670
high-performance computing like this

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,620
what we are working with IBM is to role

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,930
or something called f1 analytics

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,730
platform under that platform we are

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,790
going to solve that industry problems

00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:01,310
for db2 data warehouse big data and

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,050
machine learning so under one platform

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,880
we are solving multiple use cases and

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,070
this will be very useful for customers

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,200
who is trying to solve a data warehouse

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,600
problem or a big data problem they are

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,150
trying to you know reduce the storage

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,740
cost and adopt the big data or they want

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,410
to go into that once category of machine

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,240
learning so we are kind of combining all

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,610
these three pent benefits into one

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,920
platform and working with IBM we are

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,720
able to find the Rolly topic so we

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,590
understand this whole architecture this

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,380
is Intel in the chips yep this is Lenovo

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,830
with the hardware layer and this is IBM

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:40,670
at the software integration layer right

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,520
so it's not only important works that we

00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:46,910
love but it's big sequel our commercial

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,050
database for Hadoop and it's our data

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,050
science experience

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,470
so if we were to have this conversation

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,110
twelve months from now where would you

00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,940
like to see that wine twelve months from

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,920
now what would you like what would you

00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,510
like to be different then than it is now

00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,450
we think it's gonna be ubiquitous

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:12,930
absolutely ubiquitous okay we we know

00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:16,650
that computers are headed towards faster

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,860
CPUs more cores more memory solid-state

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:23,640
storage we know that that's what's going

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,340
to evolve so the question is is are you

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:30,870
going to get a competitive advantage if

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,690
you use it now so what we are doing is

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,790
taking advantages of latest innovations

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,920
in the hardware the faster processor

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,230
faster storage foster networking and

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,110
combining with the latest innovations in

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,330
the software the spark the biggest cure

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,880
data science machine learning and

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,160
wrapping up this as an integrated

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,020
solution and going after solving and

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,760
industry problems which will be more

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,370
important for the customers to go and

00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,200
write so many of the problems that we're

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,780
trying to solve really do rely on

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,630
performance so this is I think really

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,960
good so thank you the key is bits of

00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,940
performance energy efficiency and this

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,030
fact that it comes as an integrated

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,880
system prepackaged stratified integrated

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,830
system so so that customers have this

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,110
solution up and running within a shorter

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,630
period of time so it's a faster time to

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,910
deployment key aspect as well actually

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:29,180
so for short we look for that 12 month

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,180
