	00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,560
but before we get to the 25th I want to

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,900
step back a little bit to really the

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,240
beginning point for us is our business

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,820
mission to empower every individual and

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,810
company organization on the planet to

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,510
achieve more and and privacy and data is

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,160
a big part of that because people are

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,110
only gonna use technology that they

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,430
trust and you only you create that trust

00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,110
if you're demonstrating that you're

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,910
keeping data secure you're being

00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,550
transparent about how you're using it

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,219
you're providing controls to individuals

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,829
and companies and so a couple of years

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,289
ago we we looked at our privacy

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,370
principles and adjusted them to reflect

00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,679
our new mission of empowering

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,019
individuals and organizations to achieve

00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,609
more that was moving away from Bill Bill

00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:52,589
Gates's original mission which was to

00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,499
have a have a computer in every on every

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:58,260
desk and in every home and so we we

00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:59,969
created these principles and the timing

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,469
of it was very good because it was right

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,960
around the time that the gdpr was being

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,780
developed and and the final versions

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,120
were coming out and and the key things

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,890
for me are really the benefits to you

00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,660
we're putting the individual at the

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:18,600
center of that control transparency and

00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,400
then security isn't is underlays all of

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,010
that and I think so so much of that is

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:29,130
really tied up in what the gdpr is doing

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:31,200
as well and these principles they they

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,680
really will prevail as time goes on

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,550
because they're our bedrock principles

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,840
that's not to say that there won't be

00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:39,180
challenges I mean even right now

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,590
transparency is increasingly challenging

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,630
in a world of AI but but it's something

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,400
that we will that is critical and that

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,020
we will stick with and these are also

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,270
global principles it's not something

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,380
that we did in response to the gdpr or

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,150
any specific regulation but I think if

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,400
you look at how the GDP are you know of

00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:02,670
course it applies to European or

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,260
European Union individuals but the

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,960
principles underlying it is something

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,729
that are that are more global and so

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,819
that's why Microsoft has has decided

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,109
that we are going to apply the data

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,850
subject rights that are really at the

00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:16,230
heart of the GDP our so whether you're

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:19,980
looking about rights of access or

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,630
erasure correction portability that

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,250
those are going to be applied for all of

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,870
our consumers wherever they are in the

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,420
world which is which is a key thing for

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,370
us because at Microsoft we believe that

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,500
privacy is a fundamental human right and

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,630
so that means it can't be cabined to one

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,260
geographic area we have to apply it

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,260
