	00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:08,650
so this superpower think of it and I'm

00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:12,850
gonna draw a picture in your mind now of

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:15,910
a daisy everyone knows what a daisy look

00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,380
like yellow but in the middle lots of

00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,470
white petals all the way around the

00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:22,779
outside okay some of the guys look a

00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,849
little confused here but I can tell the

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:28,539
women are with me we're going to do a

00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:30,699
data Daisy add a to Daisy is when you

00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:34,239
were in the middle bit here and you can

00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:36,730
plug in different petals of data now in

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,489
the first instance you can only plug in

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,980
your current account that's the bit that

00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:44,469
went live in January and there's not a

00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,239
great value exchange between you knowing

00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,039
what's in your current account it's

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,750
driving a whole load of services like

00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,480
personal financial management

00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:54,609
yeh you spend too much on coffee louise

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,230
and you people are down there going yeah

00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:58,870
she had two big coffees this morning

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,969
right okay but when you can plug in the

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,579
next petal when you can plug in the

00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:06,490
mortgage petal and the savings petal and

00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:09,490
the loan petal that starts to give you a

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,500
much more complicated picture of your

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,240
life a much more sophisticated picture

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,560
of your life you could start to make

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,080
decisions you actually understand okay

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,300
really important in Australia you'll be

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,340
able to plug in your energy petal you'll

00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,160
be able to plug in your telco petal in

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:30,250
time organisations will wake up to this

00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,050
and realize they're competing on the

00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,600
data they can make available to their

00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,900
customers to provide the services those

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,810
customers actually want and as the

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,210
petals on your data daisy fill up you

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,510
will start to experience hyper

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,300
personalized predictive and pre-emptive

00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,110
services and when people say to me but

00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,130
what are these services Louise I

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,020
struggle a little bit because these

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,550
aren't there are three characteristics

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,040
of the services that we will actually

00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:06,820
get number one services we didn't know

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,520
we wanted two services we never asked

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,750
for and services three the

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,970
we can't live without hyper personalized

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,690
predictive and pre-emptive services

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:22,050
based on the data we generate flexing

00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,320
and flowing around us as our data Daisy

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,320
