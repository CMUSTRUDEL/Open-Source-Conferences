Title: When to KISS Zubin Siganporia (QED Analytics)
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	The KISS principle tells us to “Keep it simple, stupid.” As machine learning techniques become more sophisticated, the need to KISS only becomes greater. This is especially true for industries that have been more hesitant to embrace data analytics. Zubin Siganporia discusses the role that simplicity plays in approaching a problem and then convincing end users to adopt data-driven solutions to their challenges.

another project that we've got involved

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,440
with recently has seen as partner with

00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:11,889
one of the world's largest legal firms

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,019
and I know very little about law but I

00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:16,810
do know that lawyers like writing lots

00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,490
of handwritten notes and initially I

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,609
thought that it would be really great to

00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,939
take this handwriting and apply a

00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:28,210
cascade of deep learning algorithms to

00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:31,560
convert that to electronic text then

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:34,390
perhaps change the language if necessary

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,600
extract the tone the sentiment from it

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:41,620
and present all of this in summary form

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,600
by computer synthesized voice and this

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,270
can be done we've got prototypes that

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,150
work actually pretty well but it turns

00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,380
out to be complete overkill in the legal

00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,010
industry because they're so

00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,000
technologically underdeveloped

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,850
that there's a huge amount of

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,910
low-hanging fruit that can and should be

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,289
more profitably picked off so just the

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,450
act of collecting data storing it

00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:09,280
properly and presenting that is actually

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,460
for them a massive step forward and you

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,109
may as well do that first and for us on

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,090
the technical side perhaps the biggest

00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:19,570
challenge is knowing how to present that

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,789
data so for example if you wanted to

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,850
know who is communicating with who

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:26,979
between or within an organization you

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,789
could create a massive spreadsheet of

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:32,409
female metadata but to a human that

00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:34,270
isn't particularly appealing it's

00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:37,240
probably a lot better to create some

00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:41,729
kind of graphical view with perhaps

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,729
