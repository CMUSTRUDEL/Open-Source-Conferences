Publication date: 2018-05-23
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Some machine learning proponents claim you only have to provide data to get value. However, reality is a bit more complex. On the way to active analytics for business, we have to answer two big questions: What must happen to data before running machine learning algorithms, and how should machine learning output be used to generate actual business value?

Jean-François Puget demonstrates the vital role of human context in answering those questions. You’ll discover why human context should be embraced as a guide to building better, smarter systems that people will use, trust, and love.

This keynote is sponsored by IBM.
