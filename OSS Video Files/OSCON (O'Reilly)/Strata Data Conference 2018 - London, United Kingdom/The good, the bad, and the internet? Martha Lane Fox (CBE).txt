	00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,090
but now I think in the UK we have a

00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:09,669
chance to rethink what do we mean by

00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,490
responsible technology how do we make

00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:14,110
sure that the 50% of people that think

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,590
technology helps them every day is

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,740
actually 95% and that the 12% of people

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,349
that think technology is harming society

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:27,160
so is good for society sorry is actually

00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:30,630
95% well I think this is beginning to

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,980
happen because the moment feels quite

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,230
powerful there are a number of factors

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,640
that are coming together and it not

00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,220
everyone we're trying to look at again a

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,640
systems approach to how do we make

00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,700
technology feel more responsible and

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,700
that is about the three parts of the pie

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,850
that society folk is made up of firstly

00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,190
we do probably need better regulation or

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,110
some regulation some intervention by

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,560
government and our research that not

00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,750
everyone bears that out 63% of people

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,880
want the government to regulate around

00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,260
their data and the good news is that GD

00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,850
P R and some of the changes that are

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,220
coming will be the first stage of that

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,680
however imperfect at least it's a step

00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,570
forward although if I have another GD P

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,010
our email when I put my email back on

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,690
after speaking to you this evening I'm

00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,720
going to throw my smartphone out of the

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:22,030
cab window but still we will need better

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,170
and more regulation so at door everyone

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,480
were quite focused on helping

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,909
policymakers understand technology

00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,070
better because to me the gap between

00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,650
people who work in the world of policy

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,900
legislation in Parliament and the world

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,450
that we are all working in day by day is

00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,580
far removed from each other and that gap

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,020
has to close because we're going to have

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,240
regulation and we must make sure it's

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,610
the best possible regulation and that it

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,950
encourages innovation and puts us in the

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,610
best possible role for the world going

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,830
forward

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,540
so the government has to play a role in

00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,430
all of this that's the first part of the

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,090
systems change in responsible technology

00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,100
the second part is all of us as

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,080
individuals this is something that I've

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,409
been working on for quite a while and I

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,790
feel so strongly about I did some work

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,129
for two Prime Minister's about the

00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,019
digital divide in this country people

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,849
who have never used technology and how

00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,950
can we help them use it because surprise

00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,020
surprise it's mainly people who

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,190
have no money and worst of all people

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,019
who have no money and live in the

00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,959
countryside which as you may know is the

00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:25,420
most poor piece of the puzzle of all the

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,250
most vulnerable people not that's not

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,650
the only groups of people but generally

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,800
it tends to be the poorer communities

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:35,800
and marginally the older communities and

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,140
it really matters it really matters that

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,510
a million people don't use the Internet

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,000
or cannot use the Internet and yet are

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,700
unemployed and yet ninety percent of

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,110
jobs are only advertised online that's a

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,280
pretty hideous number so you're caught

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:54,069
in that trap so we as individuals have

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,799
to take with more of curiosity and

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,470
interest in technology it's not just

00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,930
about that basic digital skills and that

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,730
basic level of connectivity you know

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,860
people who don't use the Internet

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,989
that's one category that's quite an easy

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,540
one to solve actually you just need to

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:12,549
help across a quite a set of things that

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,640
you can just tick off on a list can they

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:18,340
search can they use email can they sell

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,350
complete a transaction safely so that's

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,450
more of an easy part of the puzzle but

00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,920
the piece is harder and that I'm

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,739
particularly interested in is about

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,590
digital understanding how can we make

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,019
sure that people have the curiosity and

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,660
the resilience to be able to question

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,340
the technology to make sure that they

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,889
are in control of it it is not in

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,359
control of them you'd be amazed how many

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,910
people don't know that you can turn off

00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,430
notifications on social media you've

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,079
amazed how many people I know who don't

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,790
actually know that it's better to

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,329
probably leave your smartphone out of

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,970
your bedroom

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,910
it's definitely amazing how many people

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,799
have absolutely no idea what the

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:59,650
transaction between them

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,530
and a website is in our research at door

00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,900
everyone over 80% of people said they

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:07,630
didn't understand what the transaction

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,069
around their data was on the internet

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,099
and with the services that were they

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,540
were using most people still think data

00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:15,970
is just what they're paying for in their

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,070
mobile phone package we must remember

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,039
that there's still a huge hurdle in

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,599
bringing people up to understand the

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:26,760
internet and the world we live in in

00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:26,760
