Description: 
	Pierre Romera (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ))

Last November, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published the Paradise Papers, a yearlong investigation on the offshore dealings of multinational companies and the wealthy. Four hundred journalists from more than 60 countries worked together, sifting through 13 million documents to uncover stories about Trump associates, the Canada prime ministerâ€™s chief fundraiser, and jets from the Isle of Man, among other things. Pierre Romera offers a behind-the-scenes look into the process and explores the challenges in handling 1.4 TB of data (in many different formats) and making it available securely to journalists all over the world.
