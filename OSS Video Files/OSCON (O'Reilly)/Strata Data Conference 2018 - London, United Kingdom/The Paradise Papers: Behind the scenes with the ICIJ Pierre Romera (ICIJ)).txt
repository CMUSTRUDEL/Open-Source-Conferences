Publication date: 2018-05-23
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Pierre Romera (International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ))

Last November, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) published the Paradise Papers, a yearlong investigation on the offshore dealings of multinational companies and the wealthy. Four hundred journalists from more than 60 countries worked together, sifting through 13 million documents to uncover stories about Trump associates, the Canada prime ministerâ€™s chief fundraiser, and jets from the Isle of Man, among other things. Pierre Romera offers a behind-the-scenes look into the process and explores the challenges in handling 1.4 TB of data (in many different formats) and making it available securely to journalists all over the world.

	00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:07,540
more than one year ago today to tighten

00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:11,080
a German newspaper come to us and say

00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,780
hey I CIJ I have this huge data leak but

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,679
I can't do anything with it because well

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:20,019
it's to be and we are just one newsroom

00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:23,739
in this league there was more than 13

00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:26,529
millions of files 1.4 terabytes of data

00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:28,560
so a huge leak and they didn't have the

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:32,230
capacity to handle this

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,190
so we to the decison we started to

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:39,100
organize this investigation we were

00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:44,230
doing more than a year on the project we

00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:46,150
started in December 2016 when today -

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,480
Titan contacted us and then we said that

00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,930
this meeting in Munich in March where we

00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,310
coordinate with all the media partner

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,160
six months later we publish the first

00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,500
stories around the Panama papers this

00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,550
league and well we started to publish

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:10,749
more and more data until mid February of

00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:15,219
this year so what's on this leak in this

00:01:10,749 --> 00:01:18,399
leak you have 1.4 terabyte of data which

00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:22,389
is not the biggest leak in history but

00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:24,639
almost the biggest will and that mean

00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:27,340
that you cannot use traditional tool to

00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:30,270
analyze this you cannot use Excel this

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,090
kind of stuff because it's way too big

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,130
if you have to inspect every file and

00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,459
use one minute profile which is a

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,530
minimal you would spend 20 26 years to

00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,380
analyze every file so that's huge and

00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,749
that shows the importance of having many

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,999
people with a lot of expertise to enter

00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:53,859
just kind of file so if you look on the

00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:57,249
sources of this file they are they come

00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:59,829
from 21 different sources first one and

00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:02,319
the biggest one is Apple be at rest

00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:07,509
company based in Bermuda that well have

00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:11,170
add a data leak of 6.8 millions of

00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:13,330
documents and there is also this company

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,670
called audacity trust based in Singapore

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,940
with

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,340
as many document but a lot of and

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:24,030
finally we had data from nineteen

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,819
sacristy is your addiction so you know

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,830
that in text even sucrose is your

00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,800
addiction they don't have transparency

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,330
on the company registries well basically

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,340
we had those data we had those

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,410
registries for nineteen your addictions

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,880
so we started to coordinate with to the

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,470
two thousand and we gather an exclusive

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,069
network of partners for this very

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:55,470
specific project it was 95 media outlets

00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:57,269
and more than 400 journalists so a huge

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,780
network that was supposed to work only

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:03,900
on this issue but oh can you coordinate

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,870
such a big mass of journalists it's kind

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,660
of a very specific job for our CI J so

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,790
first of all we use a platform we use

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,920
before call ox wall it's basically a

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,420
forum it's very close to what you are

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,030
used to use and well it's kind of old

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,760
it's kind of buggy but it works because

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,370
well journalists know it says I know how

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,989
to use it and they are used to well

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,390
communicate on this platform to

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,430
coordinate on the investigation and you

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,620
know very often people ask me eh

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,750
or did you decide which stories with

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,670
angle the joints are going to work on

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,120
well basically they just discussed on

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,750
this platform we also had some all the

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,690
years of security on our platform one of

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:52,049
the well-known security standout we had

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,239
is TFA so you know instead of having

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,510
just one password to connect to the

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,430
platform you have to and we also try at

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,799
the end of the project who had a third

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,810
layer of security called client

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,519
certificate where we explain to the

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,430
general is tough to install a small file

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:13,910
on their computer to be able to identify

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,910
