Infrastructure first: Because solving complex problems needs more than technology 

The infrastructure-first approach explores how the crucial interactions between people, software, and operations can evolve into repeatable, sustainable systems for change. Drawing from work in technology, community development finance, social psychology, complexity theory, and championship sports, Everett Harper moves to the edge of these disciplines, centering on the key practices that are crucial for solving our most critical challenges.
