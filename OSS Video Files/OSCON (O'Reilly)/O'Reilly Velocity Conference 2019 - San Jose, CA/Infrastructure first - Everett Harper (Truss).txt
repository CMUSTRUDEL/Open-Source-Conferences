Infrastructure first: Because solving complex problems needs more than technology 

The infrastructure-first approach explores how the crucial interactions between people, software, and operations can evolve into repeatable, sustainable systems for change. Drawing from work in technology, community development finance, social psychology, complexity theory, and championship sports, Everett Harper moves to the edge of these disciplines, centering on the key practices that are crucial for solving our most critical challenges.

one of my favorite problem solvers is

00:00:05,979 --> 00:00:15,150
Jim Jane Jacobs in 1961 she wrote we

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:19,480
have to understand cities as complex

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:23,080
organisms as problems of organized

00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,490
complexity and in talking to some of the

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,060
researchers from the Santa Fe Institute

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:31,270
I learned about this complex organism

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,879
called a city that have incredible

00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,100
resilience some of the cities have

00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:37,930
existed for millennia in part because

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,970
they both have social infrastructure and

00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,760
physical infrastructure and together

00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:46,570
that enables them to adapt to different

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:53,410
conditions but even cities are

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:55,780
challenged in 1950 around 1/3 of the

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,300
population lived in cities now it's 50%

00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,739
in 15 years it's expected to be 2/3 of

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,540
the world's population will be living in

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:05,560
cities that's unprecedented scale and

00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,659
here's the set of problems how do you

00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,899
get them water how you get them food how

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,219
do you create opportunities for them

00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:16,030
these are unprecedented problems and

00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:19,020
this is a problem at scale there are

00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:23,560
other problems like this climate change

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,779
income inequality and AI all of these

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,060
require a different way of innovation

00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:29,920
and a different kind of thinking about

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,249
infrastructure let me give you an

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,579
example now anybody that has brown skin

00:01:35,249 --> 00:01:42,670
this is probably a familiar experience

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:47,799
going into the bathroom and putting your

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:49,329
hand out and you don't get anything it's

00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,969
a pretty innovative thing to be able to

00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:55,149
have an automated hand dispenser but

00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:59,950
there's a blind spot designers design

00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:02,560
this that they can't see my skin now

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,560
about 40 percent of the time that's an

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,990
annoyance and it's frustrating I deal

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:13,120
with it but if that same code and that

00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,700
same thinking is embedded in an

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,140
autonomous truck that's coming

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:23,739
right at me no amount of hand waving is

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,110
going to resolve that blind spot and I'm

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:30,610
dead

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:35,170
that's the stakes now we all have blind

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,610
spots the nature of complex problems are

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,430
that we can't see everything we can't

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,470
predict everything but we need to evolve

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,840
our thinking and we need to evolve our

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,519
practices to incorporate the fact that

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,590
we don't know all of this we might want

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:53,049
to include people at the table who look

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:59,650
different we might want to account for

00:02:53,049 --> 00:03:02,380
all the multiple stakeholders and this

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,930
gets even more high stakes when you

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:08,170
think about the proliferation of AI this

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:10,630
code could be copied hacked embedded

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:14,110
shared do millions of people all around

00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:19,000
the world to the point that this becomes

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:21,100
standard a standard vehicle that has a

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,880
blind spot to billions of people around

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:30,430
the world who look like this I asked at

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,500
the beginning who wants to make a big

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,209
impact by solving complex problems at

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,940
scale

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,100
in this case it might have been if

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,470
you're in that design meeting it looks

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,109
like raising your hand

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,810
it looks like asking a question it looks

00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:49,329
like perhaps saying is everybody at the

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,790
table who needs to be because this could

00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:56,560
have a lot of impact I don't know what

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:59,730
it is but it could we have great new

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,950
software practices design practices etc

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:05,950
and we need to include other people

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:07,660
around the table so that our thinking

00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,190
about innovation and who's included

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,190
