Title: How do we heal? Alex Qin (Code Cooperative)
Publication date: 2019-06-13
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	We’ve been working to foster a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable tech industry for years. We’ve poured billions of dollars into data collection, new hiring practices, unconscious bias training, and educational opportunities for people from underrepresented backgrounds. But we have yet to see meaningful and lasting change.

In the age of “tech as a solution to everything”—and its devastating implications on humanity—the issue of our industry’s and society’s homogenous and harmful culture is more critical than ever.

We need a true shift in consciousness in how we see each other and our relationships to radically transform ourselves and our communities. One where we move from asking, “How do we train and hire more people from X background?” and “How do we take the bad people down?” to “How do we be whole and free together?” and “How do we heal?” Specifically:

How do we heal our communities and our industry?
How do we heal our internalized racism, sexism, transphobia, and all our other harmful beliefs, thoughts, and behaviors?
How do we heal the harms that were done to us and the harms we have done to others?
Drawing inspiration from restorative justice practices and her own journey of healing, Alex Qin offers a hopeful vision for how we can come together and cocreate the world we yearn for.

	00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,149
but one year into my career at the

00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,460
tender age of 22 after a string of very

00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,830
traumatizing incidents working in tech

00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,500
got so bad that I almost quit but

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:16,090
instead I shaved my head and I read

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,650
Malcolm X's autobiography and all the

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,210
other books I could find about racism

00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,580
sexism and other systems of oppression

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,090
and I became a teacher and an advocate

00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,530
for underrepresented peoples in tech I

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,350
built tech education programs for people

00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,119
of color people without college degrees

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,100
immigrants women and I started telling

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,749
this story and advocating for diversity

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,050
and inclusion at tech conferences and

00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:40,030
most people liked my message then in

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,829
2016 I read the book the new Jim Crow by

00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,809
Michelle Alexander in which I learned

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:46,149
about how black and brown populations

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,370
are disproportionately and unfairly

00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:50,559
criminalized and murdered in the US and

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,399
how the system of mass incarceration is

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,600
truly the latest iteration of slavery I

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,589
wanted to learn from people who had

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,539
experience with the criminal justice

00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,829
system so I started teaching people who

00:00:58,539 --> 00:01:02,489
had been to prison how to code and

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,930
that's how the code cooperative was born

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,850
now over two years later we've become a

00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,950
community of people who learn use and

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,630
build technology to create life-changing

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,479
possibilities for individuals and

00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,640
communities impacted by incarceration we

00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,710
work for the liberation of all beings we

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,570
imagine and commit to building a world

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,579
where our collective humanity is

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,009
reflected in technology society and

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,329
policy and we do this not just for the

00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,070
liberation of those who have been to

00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:29,320
prison but for our own liberation and

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,350
sense of justice because no one is free

00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,179
until we are all free and last year I

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,920
finally got the courage to call out the

00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:38,950
men who have sexually harassed me at a

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,439
conference actually I did it at multiple

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,409
conferences and the talk made its way

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,200
one foot around Twitter it felt like a

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:48,219
beautiful moment of justice and I felt

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,770
like I was living my best life

00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:52,479
I got everything I'd worked so hard for

00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,429
I went from hello world freshman year of

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,990
college to almost quitting the tech

00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:58,780
industry out of fear for my sanity and

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,609
safety to making a place within it for

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,499
myself where I was thriving and unafraid

00:02:00,609 --> 00:02:04,539
I proved to the world that I was

00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:06,159
excellent I was fighting for the change

00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,630
I wanted to see in the tech world and I

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,150
was doing work I really believed in with

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,770
people I cared about there were a lot of

00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,230
labels I would use to describe myself at

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,460
this point founder director of

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,860
technology in

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,510
International public speaker social

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:25,450
justice warrior badass workaholic party

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,370
girl coding icon just kidding I would

00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:30,010
never call myself an icon someone else

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,270
did bless their heart so it looked like

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,370
I was doing really great on the surface

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,190
but something was catching up with me

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,570
stuff that you don't show on Instagram

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,680
chronic trauma from repeated sexual

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:44,880
discrimination and harassment burnout

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,990
divorce rage quitting job after job

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,860
losing work visas and a green card

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,570
self-medicating through the fear and the

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,240
pain with alcohol and other substances

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,240
and depression and suicidal thoughts in

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,340
my fight to be excellent to be accepted

00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,730
and advocate for others like me and

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,110
ultimately get revenge I had lost a lot

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,510
all these years of trying to be the best

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,040
to be bold to be perfect had come at the

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,410
cost of something I couldn't afford to

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,630
pay anymore my wholeness and freedom and

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,910
I couldn't keep doing it so I did what

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,820
people do after they get divorced I took

00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:21,880
a sabbatical actually this is a more

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,130
accurate reference I decided to take a

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,750
break from everything and try to heal

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,490
I started removing all of my

00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,360
distractions and coping mechanisms I

00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,410
quit working

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,970
social media dating and I got sober I

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,280
stopped numbing myself and screening the

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,690
world and I was forced to sit with

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,800
myself and with my feelings and to

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,080
reckon with the truth that I was not

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,940
okay that I had been harming myself for

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,340
a very long time and I hadn't been able

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,440
to stop until I hit rock bottom but I

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,690
was on a new quest now a quest to become

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,060
whole and free I learned to stop

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,130
engaging an addictive harmful behaviour

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,330
one day at a time

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,890
under those behaviors were some deep

00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,840
wounds that were created when I was just

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,390
a child wounds I didn't even know I had

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
until then when I was very young I

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:05,650
learned that I was only worthy of love

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,850
if I was perfect and I realized that so

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,950
much of what I was doing was in the

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,570
pursuit of validation I wanted the world

00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,460
to tell me I was worthy because I didn't

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,900
believe it myself and because this was

00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,700
the story I had told myself my whole

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,580
life it would take some serious work to

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,670
unlearn it so I learned to meditate so

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,450
that I'd be able to change my thoughts I

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,680
started going to meetings with other

00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,880
people who were going through the same

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,370
journey and I shared with them my

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,630
challenges my fears my shame and listen

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,070
to them share theirs

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,320
and after a while of doing this every

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,000
day and saying things out loud that I

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,560
didn't believe and crying more tears

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,540
that I thought it was possible to hold

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,230
in one body things started to move

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,730
within me

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:41,730
