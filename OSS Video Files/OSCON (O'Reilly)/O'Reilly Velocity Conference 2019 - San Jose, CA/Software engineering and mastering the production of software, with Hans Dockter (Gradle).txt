ion's and thank you for being here with

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,529
us today you know it's been exactly 10

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,660
years since you started Gradle what did

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:13,950
you see at that time that made you want

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:16,949
to start this project so it was a deep

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,500
frustration about how hard it was to

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,020
automate many aspects of the software

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,740
development process right and and I was

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,800
always you know very test-driven agile

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,080
software engineer and wanted to apply

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,780
that those practices to my teams and and

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,809
the build automation was often a plaka

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,719
for doing this successfully so so bathe

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,540
it was too hard for developers to do

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,910
simple experiments to get fast feedback

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,000
on on things they wanted to do with the

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,489
code or the feedback took too long or it

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,649
was not reliable so those where those

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,750
those was my frustration and then and

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,120
then I decided hey let's see right let's

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,579
let's do my own experiment here to see

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,250
if I can do something better mm-hmm

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,860
and so Gradle is since that time turned

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,240
into the top 20 open-source project what

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,450
would you say has changed since that

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,549
time it's a good question so yeah we

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,350
have now more than 10 million downloads

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,580
per month right so we're very stunned by

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,430
looking back to the humble beginnings

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,840
right in my in my Berlin apartment

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,369
writing the first lines of code of

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,970
Gradle and now we have millions of users

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:31,619
right so so a lot has changed in the

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:34,229
last in that time so I would say I mean

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,790
very simple thing has changed the code

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,290
bases are crawling and crawling and

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,990
crawling so all the problems that I've

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,509
seen 10 years ago getting getting worse

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,570
and worse and worse but two other things

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,670
have changed so one thing is

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:53,270
micro-services moving which often means

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:55,380
moving - - to many many repositories has

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,240
significantly increased the complexity

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,409
of shipping software continuous

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,409
integration and continuous delivery

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,390
right the software stack got much more

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,729
diverse I mean when you think back it

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,039
was normal for a company to say we are

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,869
Java shop no company is saying that

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,520
anymore you know they have they have

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,739
languages that that suit their different

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,019
needs right so so things have become

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:21,000
but I would say the most important thing

00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:23,500
that has changed is that for businesses

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,849
most of their major innovations are not

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,549
just talking about software innovations

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:30,159
innovation in general have to be

00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:34,590
funneled through software right and that

00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:37,060
is and that and not being able to

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,400
efficiently produce software is now is

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,049
now an existential threat right and that

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,060
definitely has changed many more

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,340
industry and now industries are now in

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,079
that area originally in that spot which

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,579
really was mostly too soft the classical

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:52,690
software companies but now as we know

00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:55,329
it's across all the industries and so so

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,220
developer productivity is becoming a

00:02:55,329 --> 00:03:01,030
very strategic thing for companies that

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,959
that that understand that right so so

00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,180
tell us a little bit about your

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,000
commercial offering gradle enterprise

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,590
you know who are your customers and what

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,310
problems are you solid yeah so so it's a

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,540
companies that have realized that that

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,569
innovation goes through software and

00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,510
that is a it's it's a major competitive

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:25,650
advantage that you can gain through that

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:30,069
so companies like LinkedIn Airbnb

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,109
Twitter Yelp Spotify s ap tableau but

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,910
also more more traditional companies

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:37,569
insurance companies like Mutual of Omaha

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:39,400
or you know big banks so those but we

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,780
have that awareness we have a modern

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:50,500
perspective on the importance of

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:53,650
software so so and so for them it is a

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,709
no brainer to invest into anything that

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,889
unlocks developers right so that reduces

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,889
waiting time for developers that keeps

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:05,799
developers in the flow that shields them

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,359
from flaky signals that that indicates

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,780
something is wrong or right with your

00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:14,319
with your change so if they they

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,919
understand that that developers are the

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,919
key to getting their innovation out and

00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,560
that that and so forth those are the

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,440
types of companies that that buy great

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,080
enterprise

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:32,390
the commercial product and so the

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,030
problem right we're trying to address

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,970
and that it's it's almost it's an

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,120
interesting situation right so when you

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:44,360
look at all the major industries that

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,070
are out there or demotion chemical

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,760
industries or whoever whoever

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:52,160
manufactures something for all of those

00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,370
industries right data is the key to

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,150
effectively produce software so if I

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,880
would go to I would say maybe with with

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,680
a handful of exceptions to any software

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,360
company in the world and ask the most

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,520
basic data about their software

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,680
manufacturing process how many tests

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,780
have you run last week how many of them

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,220
failed what is the average time it has

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,840
take the answer would be - no idea

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:21,800
right and we're talking about something

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,690
that costs developers hours of hours

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,000
every day so this is not like a minor

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,070
thing right it's be talking easily about

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,890
bottlenecks and inefficiencies that that

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,600
take a day or more away of every

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,450
developer in organization that there is

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,370
no insight right and with no insight you

00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,650
cannot optimize in any reasonable way

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,960
it's way software is way too complex to

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,340
Gutfeld wise or what do we have to do to

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,710
make developers more productive you need

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,720
to have the data and hardly anyone has

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,330
production data about that right -

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,580
across the developer tool chain where

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,590
are the inefficiencies I could tell you

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,770
crazy examples right we recently had a

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,890
case and those are smart companies and

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,890
yet they didn't realize that they were

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,150
executing every integration test twice

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,580
and we're complaining about long build

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,040
times it's like it's hilarious and it

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,419
was going on for years right so so but

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,960
once you have once you have data

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:19,310
collection right you you you you can

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,200
you're able to get on top of that and

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,960
that is one thing our product provides

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,419
the instrumentation across the developer

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,520
tool chain and and exposing bottlenecks

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,710
right you know what would you say is

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,370
your vision for a Gradle in the industry

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,669
so the vision for me is that software

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,389
engineering becomes the production of

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,759
software

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,099
as professional as in the other

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,750
industries so you have a so I want to

00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:49,580
see a PhD thesis on mana repose more

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,009
effective or less effective than my two

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,889
repos I want to see from academia to

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,289
practitioners right I want to see a full

00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,659
embrace of the manufacturing of software

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:02,240
as a discipline that is so complex such

00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:04,789
an exciting topic traditionally people

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,650
who who were responsible for let's say

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,150
build and release the engineer we're

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,159
second class engineers they were not

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,960
good enough to writing application code

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,240
that that's where we have been 10 where

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,889
we were 10 years ago so this is changing

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,560
but we're still at the very beginning

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:21,889
and then I want to see that that that

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:26,060
every software team has experts

00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:28,069
dedicated to getting the full potential

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,779
of the developers out right

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,759
really unlocking them and giving them

00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:34,099
also some of the joy back they had

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,719
especially in the larger teams when

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,909
doing software in the beginning and a

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:40,460
lot of that is now turning into

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:42,139
frustration because of some of the

00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,389
problems I have described so that is my

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,460
give them and then arm them with the

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,500
data with deep analytics to to those

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,240
experts to productivity experts to read

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:57,050
to do that job that's my that's my

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:59,449
vision for the industry so you can go to

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:04,520
Gradle calm right look at the

00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:07,580
introductory video we also have a

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,139
website scans service scans cradle comm

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,330
where you can do some of the

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:14,419
instrumentation in analytics for free I

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,029
talked about and then just contact us

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,949
right do it trial with us we were more

00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,830
than happy to help you we have a lot of

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:23,479
expertise in the field and and then let

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,159
the data speak for itself right it will

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,039
be very interesting the first time you

00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,879
really see oh what what what actually is

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,390
happening right

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,800
how how how efficient is the tool chain

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,510
from the team in Bangalore versus the

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,940
team in London right all questions that

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,789
are that do not have an answer today for

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,380
most organizations home to thank you for

00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,190
coming and talking with us thank you

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,190
