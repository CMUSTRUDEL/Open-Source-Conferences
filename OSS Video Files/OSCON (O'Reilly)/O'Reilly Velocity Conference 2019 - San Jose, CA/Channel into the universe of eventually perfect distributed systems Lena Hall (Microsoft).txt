Description: 
	Distributed systems of today are immensely different from distributed systems just a decade ago. So how did our approaches and practices progress with time? What are the distributed algorithms at the heart of most systems we are using every day without thinking about it, and what are the challenges? How do distributed system building blocks evolve and advance while we strive for simplicity and create new layers and abstractions? What is really important for practical distributed systems of tomorrow? Join Lena Hall on an adventure into the multifaceted universe of ever-changing distributed systems.
