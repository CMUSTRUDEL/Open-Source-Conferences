Title: The cloud native elephant in the room, Bob Quillin (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
Publication date: 2019-06-13
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	While cloud native appears to be on a huge winning streak, there’s an elephant in the room—too many enterprise development teams have been left behind, facing a host of cultural changes, complexities, and training challenges. Bob Quillin outlines how the cloud native community can address these challenges and create a more open multicloud future, reduce complexity (rather than piling more on), and be more inclusive to all teams—modern and traditional, startups and enterprises alike.

This keynote is sponsored by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

	00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:05,580
I'm gonna talk today a little bit about

00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:08,460
how we can build a bigger better cloud

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,929
Native community and you know address

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,820
some of the elephants in the room around

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,309
some of the challenges that we're seeing

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,580
in building a bigger and better cloud

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,500
community so your cloud native is really

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,260
on a quite a roll right now you might

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,550
say it's a golden age for developers you

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,800
can take a look at this conference and

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,210
some of these sessions on DevOps sre

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,200
development processes talking about

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,449
kubernetes and all the cloud native

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,679
infrastructure open source all these

00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:37,350
things are building blocks they're

00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:40,350
really helping us change how we develop

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,710
and run DevOps has changed you know how

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,069
we develop open source has democratized

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,359
the platform's we use and the cloud has

00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:51,210
really changed where we run those

00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:53,159
applications to also where we develop

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,159
build and deploy those so everything's

00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,019
changed but really there's there's an

00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,989
elephant in the room and there's many

00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:03,030
challenges that we need to address to

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,610
get to that next level for cloud data to

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,200
really grow this community bigger and in

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,400
fact there's probably more to more than

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,810
one elephant in the room and we'll talk

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,080
about those and talk about some of those

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,850
challenges and it turns out a lot of the

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,620
the technical challenges we've knocked

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,510
down over this last few years especially

00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,720
around kubernetes and the cloud native

00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,310
open source community but the key

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,680
challenges are really people challenges

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,300
and this is a cloud native CN CF

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,750
cognitive computing foundation survey

00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:33,600
from from last year and it shows the top

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,020
issues are still people issues cultural

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,810
change complexity lack of training

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,060
take a look the technical issues like

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,140
security monitoring storage networking

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,400
those are all coming down and we're

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,900
doing a really good job you could pat

00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,530
ourselves on the back or i'll addressing

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,560
those still work to do but lots of

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,590
progress in solving these technical

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,420
issues the people issues continue to

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,280
show up on many other services to get

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,890
labs survey you see replacing ingrained

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,810
practices resistance to change cross

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,540
team communication so these are all

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,429
people oriented issues and things that

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,350
we they're really the elephants the room

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,910
I want to talk about and really one of

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,970
the biggest ones is that Enterprise

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,300
teams are feeling left behind a lot of

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,940
this

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,980
progression of this transition is as we

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,900
make this transition we keep piling more

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,830
and more tools more more complexity on

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,990
top of complexity and as this transition

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,790
starts you know they're working their

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,330
way through this process and many people

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,100
are choosing a single cloud strategy to

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,680
simplify the process which ends up

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,410
limiting your agility kind of boxing you

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,730
in it really is the exact opposite of an

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,560
open strategy so let's talk about you

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,950
know specifically some of those elements

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,660
the room how to deal with those you know

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,110
the first thing we're gonna look at is

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:58,100
building out an open community one

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,810
that's driving to a multi cloud future

00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,270
one that's more sustainable where we

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,040
focus on managed services for teams to

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,690
help them leapfrog complexity so you

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,220
don't have to do it yourself there's

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,500
enough of the DIY we've done over the

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,360
last few years and cloud native there's

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,830
managed services now that actually take

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,260
care of a lot of that complexity for you

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,390
and to be more inclusive across modern

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,810
and traditional enterprise and cloud in

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:26,580
a broader spectrum of tools and

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,480
companies and use cases to support and

00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,570
it walked through a few use cases

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,950
stories around this one first one I want

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,110
to talk about discern and you all

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,150
probably know CERN pretty well it's the

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,780
one the largest physics labs in the

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,430
world in Europe they're a big WebLogic

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,280
and database shop they're looking to

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,860
modernize their architecture they are

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,480
you know blob disaster recovery projects

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,150
that are going on they're starting to

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,010
use the kubernetes operator pattern to

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,530
put WebLogic on top of that so they can

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,110
manage WebLogic in the context of

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,180
kubernetes and it's a great on ramp in

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,890
the cloud native for them it's also

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,370
showing some huge improvements with CI

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,780
CD I'm gonna walk do a quick video here

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,290
and let them tell the story themselves

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,290
so

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,240
certain is an European Organization for

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,180
Nuclear Research I work in the overlap

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,400
context we provide WebLogic

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,560
infrastructure cost Java critical

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,480
application for said we were spending a

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,420
lot of time basically maintenance tasks

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,040
so at some point we decide to find a new

00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,260
technology of something that was acting

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
us to less focus on the maintenance and

00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,300
focus more on the developers needed I

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,750
started to work with kubernetes and to

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,910
migrate the WebLogic infrastructure to

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,160
kubernetes and other containers we were

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,830
able to deploy the same WebLogic cluster

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,050
in two minutes before it was taking us

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,120
at least half a day thanks to this new

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,490
tool that is what logic deploying

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,060
tooling we are basically able just to

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,730
write a simple clip config file run the

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,650
script and we have a new domain in few

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,930
seconds this is amazing because before

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,090
was not release thanks to kubernetes and

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,430
some advantages that come in some things

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,830
like the fact that our web logic

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,920
deployment is more portable now we are

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:16,380
basically mystically ow o CI that have

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,290
helped us to mean great automatically

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,960
our service from on-premise to cloud in

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,630
case of disaster I noticed that my

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,240
advice my suggestion were listen from

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,920
the product manager or WebLogic on

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,220
kubernetes that is basically the

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,650
relationship between server and oracle

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,720
where we are not anymore customer but we

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,800
are partner

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,720
[Music]

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,669
I think that's a great example of how a

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,330
team can actually use something they

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,729
know already

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,400
that's an on-ramp into cloud native so

00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:54,389
using web logic on top of kubernetes

00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,669
allows them to do domain creation

00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,250
management scale up and scale down in

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,750
terms of kubernetes but also using their

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,580
web logic infrastructure on top of that

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:08,590
so a very inclusive approach to that

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,810
strategy held on is a project an open

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,449
source project that helps Java teams

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,800
move to micro service architecture so

00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,400
another example of how we help

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,830
enterprise teams to focus on moving and

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,889
migrating and transitioning to the cloud

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,750
held on helps you use kubernetes

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,909
containers it's a very cloud native

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:30,669
infrastructure it really helps Java

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,680
teams then use what they know in a micro

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,150
service environment there's a range of

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,130
other projects to that we're working on

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,990
that we've open-sourced FN is another

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,090
good example it's an open service

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,270
framework or the few open serverless

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,599
favouring works out there growl VM is a

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,979
virtual machine it's a polyglot approach

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,479
really provides startup memory and

00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:51,969
performance improvements designed for

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,430
the cloud so all these tools all these

00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:56,830
approaches really help teams move to

00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:01,659
cloud using open source technologies in

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:03,759
the process I talked a little bit about

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:05,469
database teams - database teams are

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,539
moving to the cloud autonomous database

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:10,599
is a great set of new services that

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:14,259
automate cloud and database operations

00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,240
on or without infrastructure we've also

00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,830
introduced the Oracle cloud

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,169
infrastructure service broker for

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:24,219
kubernetes built on the open service

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:26,949
broker API that allows them database

00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,050
teams not only improve performance and

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:31,449
lower cost as they go to the cloud but

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,919
also modernize their architecture in the

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:34,810
process and connect to kubernetes and

00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:39,849
cloud native architectures along with

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:43,029
database activities and in this process

00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:46,090
you know where your DevOps is actually

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,589
making development teams happier there's

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,110
been some great surveys the story lines

00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:52,750
around you know dough ops teams who are

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,910
using these approaches are 2.2 times

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,850
more likely to recommend their place of

00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,920
work so you get a happier dev team you

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,560
get better results you get to migrate to

00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,480
new modern architectures and they're

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,550
happier because they're spending less

00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,620
time on remediation less time and on

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:12,090
plan work and more time doing the things

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,090
we want to do the fun stuff

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,640
so in summary it's really time to

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,190
embrace the elephants

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,480
and really look at me a dress alluring

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:24,640
