well Bob thanks for coming in today here

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,330
can you tell us a little bit about how

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,910
cloud native technology and DevOps

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,940
cultures changing application

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,549
development today yeah it's um it really

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,119
is a I called it a golden age for

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:21,050
developers I we talked about the three

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,000
C's a lot culture code and cloud and

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,410
there's been you know movement along

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,150
each of those three in pretty

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,010
fundamental ways over the last five to

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,070
six years and around cloud native in

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,390
particular last two or three years

00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,270
culture is really something around

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,969
DevOps and DevOps changing how we

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,770
develop and work together as a

00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,300
development operations team you see a

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,850
lot of discussion here at velocity

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,579
around DevOps and sre site reliability

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,309
engineering before was saying security

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,730
now dev sec ops there's discussions on

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,289
AI ops and we've talked about DB ops

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,199
even how database comes into that so

00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,730
there's a whole movement around how the

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,300
cultures changed that's kind of a people

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,519
or anything and then cloud native and

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,670
particularly Burnett us and the cloud

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,700
native computing foundation CN CF I've

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,380
really take an open source and

00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,360
democratize that made it available to

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,360
the things that you know Netflix uses

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,250
and Google users and and uber and lyft

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,110
have used to scale out their web scale

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,799
infrastructures now that's available to

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,420
a start-up you know a guy working on the

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,770
weekends person work on weekends with

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,320
you know on code weekend warrior and an

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:39,420
enterprise to so this open source

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,759
technology is really taking what has

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,140
been you know used by a lot of very web

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,549
oriented companies and now it's working

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,790
its way into enterprise when you sway

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,860
into startups etc and then a cloud of

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,829
course is little change you know how we

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,899
where we run our our code where we

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,540
develop it where we build it etc and

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,670
given the score an infinite scale

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,159
elasticity so many ways no it changes

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,229
you know the technology the people where

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,820
we run how we run so it does these

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,439
fundamental changes all kind of building

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,069
on each other you create this huge

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,819
opportunity I think for developers and

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,959
enterprises to really go to the next

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,450
level also and what would you say some

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,599
the main challenges enterprises are

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,969
facing is they try to adapt into you

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,010
know use these tools and processes you

00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:26,349
see it a lot in surveys and in

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:29,170
discussions that anything that revolves

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:32,049
around people and culture number one

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,079
issue is cultural change and you know

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:37,510
trying to help teams move enterprise

00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:39,040
teams you know adopt new processes and

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,329
new ways of working together that's

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,670
quite the biggest issue and you see it

00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:43,689
repeated over and over over and over

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,510
again it's not necessarily the

00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,609
technology issues we've got really good

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,230
in the cloud native in a container space

00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:52,560
and beginning to fix those around

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:55,919
security and networking and monitoring

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,959
but it's the people issues around

00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,489
culture complexity is another huge issue

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,389
too you know there's lots and lots of

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,400
tools and we're putting more tools and

00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:08,019
complexity on top of complexity so as

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,669
people are trying to make this cultural

00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:12,430
change this transition they're also

00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,620
having to learn more and more technology

00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:18,549
at the same time and sometimes people

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:21,250
try to simplify you know their approach

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:22,659
by using a single cloud which ends

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,799
locking them in about a year later

00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,040
they're locked in their pain in the

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,359
corner they can't get out it's kind of a

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,099
exact opposite of an open strategy

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,590
really limits your choice limits your

00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:35,290
agility so those are some of the key

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,699
challenges that people are facing both

00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,799
on the people side and the technology

00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,329
side so and how would you say the cloud

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,120
native community is addressing some of

00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:45,909
these challenges we talk a lot about you

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,889
know taking a more open approach and

00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:51,220
we're trying to drive to a multi cloud

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,629
future trying to be more inclusive and I

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,430
think this is an interesting one where

00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:57,459
you can begin to look at how do you

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,949
bring enterprise teams in using some of

00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,310
the new approaches for example it can

00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,290
Renetta

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,500
where you can build an operator that you

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:08,439
could run for example oracle has a large

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,359
web logic and database community you can

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,489
run web logic applications on top of a

00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,379
kubernetes operator and allows you to

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,579
you know from context you know it's like

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:22,150
an on-ramp into cloud native java teams

00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:24,729
we've recently open sourced a framework

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,560
called hello Don and hello Don helps

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:27,700
Java teams about micro-service

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,740
frameworks and deploy

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,690
those in the cloud using container using

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,150
kubernetes so you know you have Java

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,750
teams we have Enterprise WebLogic teams

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,550
even database teams can start using we

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,260
have new autonomous database services in

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,450
the cloud which automate a lot of

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,610
database administrative activities but

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,670
they can connect into an Oracle cloud

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,840
service broker that gives you access to

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:52,480
all the Cavanaugh's cloud native

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,670
technologies so you can you know improve

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,740
performance lower cost but you also

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,900
modernize your architecture we're trying

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,030
to find these on-ramps we're more

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,380
inclusive they're more sustainable

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,270
because they're managed services you

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,610
don't do it all yourself there that we

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,080
do handle all the complexity for you so

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,820
I think those are all things being more

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,560
open sustainable and more inclusive and

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,170
finding these on ramps and easy ways to

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,370
get on the cloud so how would you say

00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,950
Oracle's helping its customers move to

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,410
cloud and cloud native tech and culture

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,470
generally yeah so you know a lot of it

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:31,450
comes down to you know focusing on you

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:34,360
know context and you know on ramps that

00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,070
help people you know not having to learn

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,510
all themselves you know the complexity

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,230
issue is that there's so much to learn

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:43,210
first of all you don't have to right now

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,700
learn all this technology and deploy

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,320
yourself and a DIY memo do yourself you

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,060
can use a managed service and the

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,250
managed service actually handles all the

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,230
complexity for you you can use some of

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,290
these different techniques brokers

00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,820
service brokers operators api gateways

00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,440
that integrate into the things you

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,520
already have so you don't have to build

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,650
it all from scratch that's not a

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,360
greenfield application and primarily

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,280
most the enterprise's have a lot of

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,250
install based applications and they have

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,690
data gravity they have governance issues

00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,400
they have regionality issues but they

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,020
can't move it so these are complex

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,480
problems that need to be solved and

00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,280
that's kind of the next wave I think for

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,200
cloud native we've gotten really good at

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,610
helping the unicorns and the big you

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,130
know the web scale companies be

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,870
successful and they get up on stage and

00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,400
have some great use cases but as see the

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,320
enterprises that have healthcare

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,630
applications and finance applications

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,220
and an oil and gas applications where

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,590
these are things that are you know

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,200
utilities that super a lot of people

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,010
currently they can't move quickly but

00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:43,390
want to move to the cloud for

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,370
optimization issues for efficiency

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,690
issues to lower costs but also to

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,220
modernize in the process and that's

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,260
where the cloud native technologies come

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,210
in to help you not only move the

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,420
application to cloud but improve it and

00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,340
actually modernize what you're doing

00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,980
comes the overall architecture of the

00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,630
application so what would you say is

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,640
next what's on the horizon for

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,010
application to development what's what's

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,510
in the future foot I think you know

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,280
there's some really cool stuff that's

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,910
happening in big data and machine

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,050
learning and you know as we start taking

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:16,750
all that data and all the learning that

00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,790
comes from that seems really innovative

00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,130
use cases coming out of startups now

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,960
where they're looking at take advantage

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,700
all this high power compute that's

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,990
available to them now and doing things

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,050
you're never able to do before in terms

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,110
of analyzing data at high speeds and

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,150
streaming formats and then distributing

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,280
that out maybe out to the edge and a lot

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,080
of you see Internet of Things where

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,540
you're getting more information out to

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,330
the edge with smart devices so a

00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,910
combination of sort of the cloud native

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,040
technology running the optimizing the

00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,919
clusters and its core democratizing the

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,390
core but also finding ways to access the

00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,520
data and get it out to where it where

00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,350
matters I think that's the next next
