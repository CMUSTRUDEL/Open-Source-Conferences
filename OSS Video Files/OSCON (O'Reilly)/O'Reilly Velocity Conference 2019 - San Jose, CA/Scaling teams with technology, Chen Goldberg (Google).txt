Title: Scaling teams with technology, Chen Goldberg (Google)
Publication date: 2019-06-12
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	Scaling teams with technology (or is it the other way around?)

Microservices and cloud native technologies is the path for building large-scale, distributed systems. Can it do the same for teams? Chen Goldberg leads the Google engineering team building Kubernetes, Istio, GKE, and Anthos and explains how the same tech can help build happy teams.

extensible is an important attribute for

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,540
many products and software it means that

00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:12,419
users have choice they have options and

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,209
they can customize it to their own and

00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,480
need it also means that the software and

00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:22,859
the technology can evolve over time

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,330
users appreciate choice when I joined

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,189
Google about three and a half years ago

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:31,230
to lead the kubernetes team

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:33,510
it was early 2016 there was about 600

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,510
contributors in the cobra's community

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,000
remember this number 600 and we were

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,190
doing about 50% of the contribution and

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,329
the team as I'm sure other people other

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,969
teams working in the Cavanaugh's

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,059
community were on the edge of burning

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:55,710
out converging releasing when

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,690
contribution is not organized when there

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,179
is no clear communication channels or

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,299
processes where it's really hard to set

00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:09,240
the quality bar as high as you want is

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:11,610
really really hard and it's hard

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,360
everywhere but open source make it even

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,890
worse and when the team really do

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,210
whatever is needed to get the best

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,880
product out there it is exhausting so as

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,979
part of my role when I joined I started

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560
leading towards engineering hygiene and

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,030
engineering best practices like release

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,119
cadence and quality and processes and

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,009
product themes so in this this is the

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,399
first community meeting I had the

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,770
courage to actually speak up and I was

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:46,890
advocating for a more rigid release

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,810
process that will allow teams to know

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,360
this if you know if you miss the train

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,560
the next train will come and this was

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,640
great and this was one of the things

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
that we change in the kubernetes

00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,119
community we organized working groups we

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,369
defined governance and we brought

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:07,409
emphasis on communication inclusiveness

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:11,490
and transparency but it simply wasn't

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:14,230
enough the success of kubernetes drew

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,680
more and more people into the project

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:21,099
more integrations and dependencies

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,560
internal and external to Google and not

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,989
only the kubernetes community grew also

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,650
our own team probably tripled in size in

00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:31,090
that time and we have observed our

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,610
velocity is declining

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,640
it was simply really hard to get

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,920
features out at all one team could

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,230
easily break one another team was doing

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,519
with with making it really hard to

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:48,069
anticipate that kind of changes and we

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,959
decided to address it strategically if

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,510
you look at my cube con talk from Berlin

00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,950
in 2017 this was the first time when I

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,500
talked about sustainable success this

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,959
diagram captured the significant scope

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,299
of the kubernetes projects it's similar

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,290
to the entire cloud platform from a

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:10,660
surface-area perspective the team that

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:13,030
invested in building kubernetes also

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,660
invested in creating extension point

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,130
throughout the different layers and

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,340
promoting open standards achieving

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,380
composable systems it started of course

00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,930
is an attribute an important attribute

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
of the kubernetes project as a platform

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,850
that is used to building other products

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,160
but when we saw the light at the end of

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,500
the taller tunnel and we understood the

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,739
impact it will have on our team we

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,620
double down on this investment and we

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,350
have come very far today we have over a

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:47,500
dozen mechanism to extend kubernetes in

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,870
different in different layers like cloud

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,570
providers client libraries container

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,609
runtime interface and more this allows

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:59,530
an ecosystem to evolve around kubernetes

00:03:54,609 --> 00:04:02,920
and really what extensibility brought to

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:06,190
the team was independence and velocity

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,519
the ability to move fast without having

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,889
to talk with all other teams around you

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,959
and many teams both internal in Google

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,340
and externally started building more and

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,340
