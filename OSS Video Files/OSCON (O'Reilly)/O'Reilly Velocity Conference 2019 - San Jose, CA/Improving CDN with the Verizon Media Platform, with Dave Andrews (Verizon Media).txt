they thank you for coming in can you

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,670
tell us a little bit about the Verizon

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,859
media platform and what you're

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,620
exhibiting here at velocity

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,259
I'd love to serve Verizon media platform

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,330
is kind of the latest evolution of the

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,490
business unit within Verizon that kind

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,400
of primarily deals with content delivery

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,410
networks and video streaming that

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,760
company was formed and has been called

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,519
kind of Verizon digital media services

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,300
for the last you know five years or so

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,160
and with the Verizon's acquisition of

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,780
AOL and Yahoo in the last couple of

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,559
years and some kind of restructuring

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,129
that's happened to kind of you know make

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,840
Verizon 200 as its called

00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,309
we've been kind of designated as the

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,160
center of excellence excellence for

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,829
video all things video within Verizon

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,199
itself so the horizon media platform is

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,050
kind of is this putting together of

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,600
these two pieces that can provide you

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,390
know end to end video services for major

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,770
broadcasters and coupled with a content

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,320
delivery network that can deliver that

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,140
that content all around the world it's a

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,189
little bit about your role in focus yeah

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,530
so my role at Verizon media is the chief

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,330
architect of the media platform team so

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,189
it's my responsibility to kind of

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,750
oversee everything that's happening

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,820
technically within the thing within the

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,619
team think about how we're building

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,720
solutions how we're solving customers

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:28,310
problems and try to look for as much

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,390
efficiencies as we possibly can get o to

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,520
address your last question what we're

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,250
exhibiting this year I missed that sorry

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,200
the the thing we're really excited about

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,180
this year is a kind of is giving a very

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,700
kind of sneak preview of our edge

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,500
compute offering so it's very very early

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,560
stages nothing's kind of finalized but

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,270
we did a tutorial session yesterday

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,040
there was like open to people to come to

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,680
and that was really exciting there a lot

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,090
of great feedback there so and there's

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,229
you know demos of the booth that people

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,820
can go and look at and again we're

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,680
getting a very positive reception for

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,270
the the plant so we have to bring that

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,649
product to market in the next in the

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,380
next you know well as soon as possible

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,600
really and what would you say has been

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,890
your greatest achievement or milestone

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,819
since we spoke last year oh good one

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,200
there's been a few things what one of

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,300
the things that you know were always

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,970
be proud of is the growth of the content

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,140
delivery network we've been for the last

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,610
couple of years the fastest-growing

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,470
content delivery network in the world

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,750
and we just recently crossed 75

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,640
terabytes of egress capacity putting us

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,280
you know in in the upper echelons of

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,349
kind of networks that exist on the

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,330
internet today in terms of milestones

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,370
we've done we continue to break records

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,370
on their video platform in terms of

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,780
being able to scale up to kind of

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,519
simultaneous concurrent users I think we

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,970
recently crossed you know 1.9 million

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,290
during the NBA Finals all those things

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,410
are you know really really exciting and

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,640
it's great to see the platform kind of

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,470
gaining more traction in the market and

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,700
really being put to the test with with

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,190
new things to get to live it we just

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,470
introduced 4k and so streaming the

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,420
Women's World Cup actually right now in

00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,950
4k that's kind of a that's a first and

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,079
again getting a lot of positive feedback

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,849
in the market it's what are your

00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,060
predictions for the industry in the year

00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,810
ahead

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,450
mmm in the year ahead I think we're

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,510
gonna can we gonna see in terms of CDN

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,329
we're gonna continue to see kind of the

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,250
requirement for scale as more and more

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,920
kind of content moves to being towards

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,720
being video based the end and customers

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,720
demand higher and higher quality the

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,180
networks and devices kind of need to

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,829
need to come along so devices are very

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,510
very fast your phone my phone and

00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,060
everyone's phones are all 4k capable

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,650
we're seeing the devices on the other

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,959
end the cameras and the infrastructure

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,750
for production also become 4k capable

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,010
the big kind of crunch point is going to

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,170
be the network you know in a lot of

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,120
cases so hey you know a small data point

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,560
if if everyone turned off their TVs and

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,180
immediately moved to everything over the

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,100
top the entire internet couldn't

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,930
couldn't support that not just our

00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,670
company everyone couldn't support that

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,069
that sort of delivery so there's a lot

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,380
of investment that needs to occur in the

00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,700
network and in growing and growing the

00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,130
infrastructure to be able to support

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,510
that kind of coming trend we're in a

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,519
really unique position to be able to do

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,319
that as as being part of Verizon there's

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,730
a lot of kind of investment always made

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,290
in infrastructure it's a company that

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,099
understands that the network is very

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,130
very important so i'm i think that that

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:21,299
change is going to be very very kind of

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,580
differentiating over the next year sir

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,720
building on top of that there's a lot of

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,550
kind of things

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,350
that we that you can do after you have

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,060
that after you have that basis so

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,180
streaming is one of them we have a very

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,520
kind of robust and well respected in the

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,870
industry security offering we're gonna

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,430
we're seeing like some really good

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,230
adoption and uptick there and then the

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,120
kind of new stuff that we're bringing to

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,500
market the edge compute things we'll see

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,170
that kind of watch over the next year

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,030
and then not sure if you saw my keynote

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,290
but the kind of we'll start to see the

00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,810
beginnings of that over the next couple

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,330
of years you know looking a little bit

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,120
further out as we shift kind of our

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,830
mental models of thinking about compute

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,450
only happening in one case in one

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,850
location having to kind of pick where

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,860
you do it I think we're gonna see more

00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,870
and more progression to how do we manage

00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,120
compute at multiple levels in the data

00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,980
center within or at the cloud within an

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,780
CDN layer and with you know in the next

00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,550
year or so within the multi access edge

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,010
compute which is kind of coupled to the

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,360
cellulation so there's a lot of really

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,970
interesting things coming down the pipe

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,220
for us so clearly from your comments or

00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:30,010
a lot of changes out there what are you

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,620
doing to stay ahead of them

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,590
I think answer that question would

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:39,510
probably be trying to solve the problems

00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,890
in a very robust way like it is

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,020
relatively easy like a lot of these

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:48,250
problems are relatively easy to solve at

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,740
a at a low scale by that I mean it's

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,669
relatively easy to do video streaming at

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,560
very low latency at a small scale the

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,050
problems don't exhibit themselves and

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,640
that until you kind of scale up and you

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,380
want to do it for example nationally

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,669
across the entire country or even harder

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,760
internationally across you know the

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,530
entire world coupling those two problems

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,140
and solving those two things at scale is

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,010
is is a huge challenge and it's

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,169
something that we have a lot of

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,030
experience in given that the history and

00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:17,980
lineage lineage and kind of what that's

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,600
led us to this point so I think that's

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,410
something that that is going to really

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,910
be a focus for us I think it's it is

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,410
gonna be a differentiator and it's one

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,700
of those things that it's very hard to

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,930
catch up it's very hard to kind of if

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,490
someone else is solving the scale

00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,470
problem and you haven't gotten the

00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,970
opportunity to yet it's very very hard

00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,260
to catch up so that's that's definitely

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,560
an advantage that we have in the market

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,720
right now the way you know looking

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,220
to extend and capitalize Dave thanks for

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,430
insights appreciate it thank you so much

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,430
