Title: Work as imagined and work as done: Mind the gap - Steven Shorrock (EUROCONTROL)
Publication date: 2019-06-12
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	When we think about human work, we often fail to realize that the same activity is actually two very different sorts of work. Steven Shorrock explores some of the differences between work as imagined and work as done in a variety of settings and outlines some implications for the inevitable gaps.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
so let's talk a little bit first about

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:09,030
work is imagined so workers imagined is

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,950
is really what we think that people do

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,610
or what we might expect that people do

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,859
and it's characterized by three or four

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,310
different assumptions so one assumption

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,590
is about the nature of work itself right

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,320
so when you imagine what other people do

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,980
or when other people such as myself

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,019
imagine what you do we imagine a

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,200
simplified and partial version of what

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,800
you do we have a kind of sanitized and

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,809
simplified imagination of work we

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,809
imagine that people work according to

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:47,430
prescribed rules or procedures then we

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,820
think about the system conditions or the

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,289
conditions under which we work and we

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,879
imagine that resources are usually more

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,730
optimal than they are we imagine that

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,550
competency things like our staffing

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,079
levels the state of the equipment and

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,680
procedures are more optimal than they

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,799
actually are we imagine that demand is

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,290
more predictable than it is when we

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,270
think about people we often imagine that

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,570
people are a cause of trouble in an

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,369
otherwise safe system right so we

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,520
imagine people add a source of unwanted

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,799
kind of variability and then when we

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,409
imagine outcomes we imagine that normal

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,369
work and accidents or major events are

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,110
really completely different when we

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,090
think about workers done if we revisit

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,130
those assumptions and we actually find

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,810
that work is really very messy it's

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,390
characterized by a lots of trade-offs

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,119
and compromises lots of variability in

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,880
order to get the job done our goals are

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,439
often conflicting with each other so

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,700
work has done differs on every one of

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,060
these assumptions if we think about

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,630
system conditions then we know that that

00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,930
procedures and staffing levels and so on

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,990
are often suboptimal competency levels

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,820
may vary and then when we come to people

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,950
well when it comes to workers done

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,629
because you cannot prescribe human work

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,090
in the way that we imagine people

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,830
actually create safety in an otherwise

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,790
unsafe system

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,200
so our views about work as imagined and

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,760
views about workers done are not really

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,990
compatible but the important thing is

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,390
what's actually done now if we just have

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,670
a look at this Venn diagram we can see

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,830
that there is some overlap between

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,140
workers imagined and work has done

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,230
they're not completely different things

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,760
some of what we do is what we imagine is

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,100
what is what other people imagine is

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,960
what our bosses and what the general

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,000
public and the media and so on think

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,480
that we do but very much of it is not

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,270
and work is imagined is not just one

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,580
thing right because with our imagination

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,010
of human work what we do is we make

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:59,970
procedures and regulations and rules and

00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,730
so on so we essentially prescribe human

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,320
work but that prescription of human work

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,790
is not exactly the same as what people

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,130
think it is because we can never have a

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,900
full knowledge of procedures in a major

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,240
air traffic control tower for instance

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,490
in my business there may be a thousand

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,720
pages of procedures plus tens of

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,220
temporary operating procedures and then

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,920
we have work as espoused now work as

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,019
espoused is actually what we say happens

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,489
it's how we talk about work which is

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,590
quite different to where we actually do

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,269
work it's also different to how work is

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,140
written down and sometimes it's

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,310
different to what we really believe

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,690
what's important about this diagram is

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,330
that there are many gaps right there are

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,980
many areas where there is no overlap you

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,230
can see that as a big area of work has

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,480
done which is neither prescribed nor

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,330
really imagined by anyone else nor is it

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,600
really talked about now this is a this

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,730
is a possible area of risk risk to

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,300
safety risk to security risk to

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:59,010
reputation credibility where we have

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,780
other gaps in this diagram where there's

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,780
not an overlap there's a risk to

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,500
confidence public confidence to trust

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,030
and so on it's not as simple as that

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,920
though actually because the way that

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,570
work is done is usually very very safe

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,660
and if we worked according to procedures

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:18,269
things wouldn't be so safe and so we

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,130
protect with some secrecy the way that

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,930
we work we don't like to tell everybody

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,770
about the way that we work for very good

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,660
reasons because if we do that some of

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,370
our resources may be taken away from us

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,130
some of our safety buffers some of our

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,770
margins will be taken away so we keep

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,840
the way that we work something of a

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,240
secret for good reason because the way

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,860
that we work actually works and the way

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,120
that people think that we work doesn't

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,120
