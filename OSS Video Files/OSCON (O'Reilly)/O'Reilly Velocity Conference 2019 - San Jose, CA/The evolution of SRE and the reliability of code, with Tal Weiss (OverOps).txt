	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,160
well thank you for coming in today even

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,649
with all the advancements in DevOps

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,920
tooling today where do you see the

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,870
challenges and gaps in this area sure I

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,809
think we've seen a lot of progress or on

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,699
anything it has to do with the aspect of

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,340
deploying this software we've seen a lot

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,130
of work done on orchestration of

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,859
containers kubernetes being able to ship

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,230
and push code a code out more quickly I

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,929
think the challenge is where gaps remain

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,239
is around the reliability of the code

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,340
itself we're now moving you know from a

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,829
software economy to a code economy

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,809
everything is about do you have the best

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,120
application do you have the best and the

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,120
latest features can you ship them out in

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,250
a quick in a reliable manner and I think

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,440
the ability to see deep into the code

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,629
understand exactly some folks are called

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,399
get ops even putting the power in the

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,160
hands of the developers and giving them

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,289
the ability you know exactly when where

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,149
and why their code breaks at production

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,590
remains to this day something it's very

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,059
challenging for companies and I think

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,869
that's something that the industry will

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,030
have to address a new role is site

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,909
reliability engineering do you see this

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,450
becoming a major part of organizations

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:18,030
in the future I do I do and I think you

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,400
know there's a lot of economic forces

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,229
pushing this all companies say they are

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,759
trying to keep pace with the likes of

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,740
Amazon Netflix Google and the likes to

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,810
be able to deliver software at that

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,610
level of speed yet retain the

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,729
reliability what we've seen we've seen

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,030
the move from ops in to DevOps and now

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,590
deep it aside software and engineering

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,320
reliability so we're seeing a shift left

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,030
even in the way by which we operate

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,770
applications just a number last year

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,990
alone I think the Consortium for code

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,560
quality pegged the overall cost of

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,479
software defects just in the US alone at

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,439
2.8 trillion that you're tuning with the

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,329
T in terms of impact to the economy so

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,399
the only way to address that is to get

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,159
the opposite of the house much more

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,439
deeply ingrained with that new emerging

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,209
code economy and I think we're gonna be

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,679
seeing societal engineering

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,870
I think progressing to the point where

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,310
people will be looking at almost at if

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,080
not at

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,200
similar was something like InfoSec a

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,060
critical component of the success and

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,130
the ability of an organization today's

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,750
software economy as I said our code

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,270
economy to be able to meet its goals

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,500
will rely on this new persona and what

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,470
are your thoughts on that shift left

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,380
movement I think it's just the again

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,349
economic forces are pushing it with the

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,640
cost today you know code defects for

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:41,120
major banks and financial institutions

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,340
can become 9 digits in terms of their

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,580
impact to the business at the highest

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,730
extreme so everything that a CIO our CTO

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,760
can do to make sure that issues dig

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,090
defects are caught much earlier on

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,620
during dev or doing QA it's something

00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,750
they're going to pursue it we're seeing

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,019
is a lot of the focus that we usually

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,430
had on the production side is now moving

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,980
it through the tooling and through the

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,630
budget it through the capability into

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,000
the dev side of things which also

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,280
coincides with how much code and

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,799
software just becoming a key component

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,690
of the overall reliability of the

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,430
experiences these companies are able to

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,260
deliver to their customers and so where

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,900
does overall fit into this equation I

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,180
think for us as a company from day one

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,310
we've always put our focus on the

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,590
developer and the code because we saw

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,079
that software engineering cyclable

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,030
engineering in our mine I've almost kind

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,130
of the way of the future if you look at

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,579
Hardware you know up until five or ten

00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:42,859
years ago it was all private cloud it

00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,380
was all very much no bare metal driven

00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,630
now in the world of Asher and Amazon

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,819
hybrid clouds containers with so much is

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,980
being virtualized everything has become

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:54,620
software everything has become code and

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,500
our new hero personas are the developers

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,989
and decidability engineers / ops was

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,840
designed from day one to provide these

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,670
kind of users these folks with the best

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,989
operational data out there we're not

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,209
trying to adapt traditional massive

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:13,519
unstructured log data to fit them to

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,200
these new kinds of personas into their

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,910
sari or the devs what we're trying to do

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,430
is to give these kinds of folks to give

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,630
these folks the information the

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,890
operational data that they would want if

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,750
they could design things from scratch

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,690
today they'd be - zoom

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,510
and see how code is executing down to

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,160
the most granular level in staging in

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,290
shift lift or in production to be able

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,300
to zoom out see across billions of code

00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,940
events which ones are the most critical

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,860
and in almost once and last thing being

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,840
able to quickly ascertain whether the

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,540
issues are coming from the operational

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,880
side of the house or from programmatic

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:52,040
or code or the code side of the house

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,690
these are capabilities are critical to

00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,300
these folks which have a very software

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:59,240
code driven mindset so we're helping

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,700
those guys and as a result we've seen a

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,830
lot of success over the past year even

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,020
in large organizations that you think

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,610
would move much more slowly like the

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,380
Fortune ten banks we've seen a lot of

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,380
success because they understand it to be

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,390
able to compete with you know all the

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,410
upstarts and you know nowadays even got

00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:20,120
Apple becoming you know a credit card

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,919
company everybody's under threat and

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,800
everybody's trying to see how can they

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,330
up live or their developer team the

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,680
development teams and get around this

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,330
sre bandwagon

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,979
it's wickley's possible and we've been

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,200
able to help a lot of folks with that so

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,060
things are looking pretty good on that

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,400
front for us so you talked a lot about

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,740
code level inside being critical to

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,490
reliability what do you mean by that

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:46,460
I think it's empowering folks inside

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,640
reliability and in software development

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,729
giving them the ability to see their

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,830
application as it executes right now

00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:56,690
today with traditional data they're kind

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,729
of looking at the engine through the

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,729
exhaust or searching through log files

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:04,190
sifting through thousands and thousands

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,570
of metrics and metrics graphs and we're

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,340
just trying to get to the answer

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,390
trying to back-trace from an impact to

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,250
customer from something that they made

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,590
they some changes they made it broke the

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,780
code trying to back-trace all the way to

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,360
the point of origin well to me code

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,000
level insights mean is can we transport

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,500
these guys to the point of origin can we

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,050
show them what will this off what was

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,390
the software doing in the exact moment

00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,370
where it broke can we show them all the

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,510
atoms right as a map as they are about

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,800
to explode versus you know giving them a

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,310
microscope and asking them you know our

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,680
telescope asked him to try to recreate

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,229
the sea

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,050
you know a day a week or months after

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,150
impact it's getting them there right

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,610
down to the atoms to see exact order was

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,990
the code was doing is I think the

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,630
capability that our customers are asking

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:58,160
us for thank you very much now for your

00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,160
