Publication date: 2019-06-12
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	A career in programming progresses from solving well-defined problems to defining problems to determining which to solve. What is the “right” way to do software? It depends on what kind of program we’re talking about. Jess Kerr draws lines that resolve some arguments about types, tests, and correctness.

Jess argues that most programming careers aren’t about writing software; they’re about changing it. With this distinction, she’ll share some things about reuse, delivery, quality, and how to grow as a programmer.
