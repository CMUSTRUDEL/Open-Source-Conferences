hi Bill thanks for being here thanks for

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,850
having me this is fantastic so tell us

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,980
how has Arden been able to achieve a

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,690
leadership position in the NGO and

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,049
infrastructure communities yeah that's a

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:17,250
great question we really got involved in

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,590
go 2013 when we had this need to move

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,039
from Windows to Linux and it was a

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,050
moment there when I was like finally in

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,670
another this doesn't happen very often

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,260
right you get to get in the beginning of

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,029
a tech and I was like I'm gonna take

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,830
this opportunity to start blogging I

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,989
want to start blogging my experiences

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,000
about learning this new language and an

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,649
operating system for sure - right it's

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,960
like starting completely from scratch

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,149
and I'm like I can't be the only one on

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,629
the planet starting from scratch here so

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,750
I started blogging with the idea in mind

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,550
that I knew nothing and somebody else

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,809
would know nothing how many times you

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,800
read a blog post where it already

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,300
assumes a large amount of of knowledge

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,850
so I started doing that kind of blogging

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,190
and I think it started resonating with a

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,799
lot of people who were learning go at

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,229
the same time at the time go was kind of

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,570
split between the academics who were

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,729
really jumping on early and then

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,020
developers like me who really weren't

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,400
academics we were just trying to get

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,650
work done and that blogging began to

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,900
resonate with people and that ended up

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,119
turning into a book and that turned into

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,920
training and I think it's the training

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,170
at the end of the day our ability to be

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,880
able to train developers from from the

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,729
academics to the ones that are just

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,759
trying to do it as a day job I think it

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,650
gave us that kind maybe elevated us in

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,570
the community to say you know what this

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,130
training is helping everyone here so I

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,009
think at the end of day became the

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,200
training and then that obviously ends up

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,840
allowing us to to show people that were

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,290
good engineers - and speaking of that

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,540
training

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,579
what made you add kubernetes training to

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,500
your offering of consulting because it's

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,210
in demand right now right like people

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,180
are asking for it over and over again

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,100
and I'm not the kubernetes expert like I

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,560
know software development and go

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,990
development inside and out so we found

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,940
leaders in the NGO community jerome p i

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,280
won't even try to say his last name I

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,750
called your own Pete by drone P who came

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,660
originally from docker and it's been a

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,490
noob net he's trained

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,320
for the last few years we brought in

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,890
Jerome and and other people who really

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,690
have already have respect in terms of

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,390
that so we were like we want to keep the

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,670
Arden brand really really solid so we're

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,630
very particular on who we work with

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:33,520
so the demand is there and I find it

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,770
interesting even on the go training at

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,270
some point either enough people know

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,920
this stuff where they don't need it or

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,470
it kind of fades a little bit in the

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,850
background and for me I think at some

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,990
point that's what's gonna happen to

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,600
kubernetes there's gonna be a whole

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,430
nother layer on top and kubernetes is

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,650
gonna be like what we consider Linux

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,880
today right just it's there we might

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,550
have to touch it every once in a while

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,660
and that's really what I'm gonna it's

00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,590
kind of what I'm looking at over the

00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,690
next five years when does that

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,490
transition happen but it's just the

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:05,290
demand I think everybody has for better

00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,030
or worse sometimes you don't understand

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,030
why has kind of just bought into the

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,280
kubernetes orchestration system and and

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,350
this is this is where we're at okay and

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,810
what do you think differentiates Arden

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,270
from its competitors I think what's

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,100
differentiating us right now is the

00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,440
quality of everything that we do the

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,510
quality rating we publish and the

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,880
community oriented aspects of it too I

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,520
don't just publish things on a whim I'm

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,050
always asking the community to hey can

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,440
you review this what are your opinions

00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,660
on this because for me it's it's about

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,480
opinions but if you can also get

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,700
consensus I think it it helps a lot

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,440
alright because there's not just one way

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,900
to do something even when you're

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,760
teaching it but if you can find the the

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,920
best practices and the best patterns and

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,500
the best ways but you can't do that in

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,270
an isolation you need a community so

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,209
I've been really focused on the

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,040
community I love all everything about to

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:01,690
go community and the developers and the

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,170
engineers that are all part of that and

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,790
I try to give back as much of my time to

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,300
the community as well so I'm out there

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,920
also teaching for free and we're all

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,660
around the world kind of helping and

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,080
mentoring and all of that I think that's

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,430
really helped solidify because look how

00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,640
many times you get a company that's out

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,190
there even on stage selling selling

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,410
their developers you know if you're

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,180
marketing or are you being sincere in

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,520
terms of I want

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,620
teaching us so I've made it a point at

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,590
Arden to make sure that it's it's what

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,600
we're doing first is for people and yeah

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,000
we're from Arden and if you want to

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,560
reward that great if not it's okay it's

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,139
all good because we're gonna put you

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,220
first it every time and what are you

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,630
hearing from that community of

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,169
developers about the challenges they

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,180
face I'm seeing a couple of challenges

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,340
that are that are happening when we talk

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,699
about software development I think the

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,699
best practices are still kind of loosely

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,349
out there in terms of development teams

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,449
so that creates a lot of inconsistency

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:05,460
and code bases they as soon as you have

00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:08,370
inconsistency in a code base that code

00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,009
base is about to at some point stall out

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,960
and fall so a lot of my training is

00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,300
about getting an engineering team

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
together to be rowing the boat in the

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,570
same direction at least if we're not

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,610
sure about something having the right

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,080
engineering conversation the right

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,180
engineering conversation is about

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,250
choices it's about I don't I don't agree

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,800
with the cost you're taking for the

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,840
benefit right the worst engineering

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,760
conversation is I don't like what you're

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,919
saying like there's no value in that

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,539
it's it's all about cost right and

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,979
everything in life is about cost or I

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,080
got to teach our kids this all the time

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,159
there is no choice you make that doesn't

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,310
come with a consequence

00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:47,099
maybe it's small maybe it's large but if

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,440
you don't understand the cost then how

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,510
can you make this choice so it flows

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,599
into the engineering so I think that's

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,979
been lost a lot on engineers some of it

00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:58,440
has to do with the tech they're using

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,599
when you're looking at languages that

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,690
run under an interpreter or virtual

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:05,940
machine a lot of the idea of this this

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,050
decision and this cost gets lost I think

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,470
one of the beautiful things about go

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,659
that the machine is its model so every

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,880
choice you make does affect the machine

00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:17,099
and therefore almost directly affects

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,289
the performance of what you're doing and

00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:21,659
I just think go is allowing engineers to

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,490
be engineers again and what about the

00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:25,500
surrealist movement do you see it as a

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,099
fad or something more this weird drives

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,630
me crazy crazy right because it's it's

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,690
one of these buzzwords that I don't

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,849
think people have a good so what kills

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,630
me is when I start hearing the word

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,029
serverless

00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:41,070
with functions running in the cloud I'm

00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:44,040
like God service is so much more

00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,540
than that I think we had a year where

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,130
everybody thought they could just run

00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,960
functions in the cloud and they could

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,750
build out I think people are starting to

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,400
realize the latency costs of this right

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,130
latency is death as a relates to

00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,630
performance it comes into micro-services

00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,430
seems you gotta wait on the network

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,100
you're already a million you're ready in

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,710
a millisecond and you already 12 million

00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,630
instructions lost like like and I think

00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,490
people are starting to see that for me

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,120
serverless isn't about just running a

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:14,370
function I think it's about not having

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,560
to think about the hardware anymore or

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,320
where it's located how its configured

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,060
that to me is service and I think that's

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,220
where we're at with cloud and I love it

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,280
I don't want to do ops I really don't I

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,410
love the Google you know I work a lot on

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,570
the GCP the Google cloud provider stuff

00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,370
I love walking into a terminal and say I

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,110
need this I need this I need this I need

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,300
this much computing I don't care where

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,030
it is go run my stuff I think server

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,080
lists are there I think it's gonna save

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,630
us at the end of the day I think

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,100
kubernetes eventually will save us it's

00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,770
gonna save a lot of mistakes it's going

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:48,270
to give us the computing power so I

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,590
think that's here to say I just think as

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,080
an industry we have to be very very

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,450
clear what this word mean and functions

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,090
as a service is just one part of a very

00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:59,660
large you know machine that we can

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,830
leverage in this cloud environment

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,300
thanks so much for your insights today

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,300
