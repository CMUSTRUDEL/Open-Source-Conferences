	00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,570
my favorite part so far has been a lot

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,740
of the networking and talking with

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,089
different people talk to me different

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,500
vendors kind of learning different

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,880
products and what they do what tools

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,349
they have out there and just learning

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,820
different personalities that are here

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,179
you know and uh getting to connect with

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,219
them

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,080
I enjoy the different types of people

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,490
from the East Coast so coming to the

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,140
West Coast and getting exposure to some

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,150
of the leading voices that are you know

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,740
from this area is really great the

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,840
amount of people here and their

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,430
backgrounds and the diversity it's just

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,949
really hard to find and everybody here

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,599
has the same kind of passion I would

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,579
recommend velocity to college I think

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,020
there's a lot of breads to the topics

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,649
that are available so there's something

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,559
for everyone

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,790
building testing si ICD pipelines

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,879
deploying monitoring DevOps

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:47,399
infrastructure engineers and folks that

00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:49,410
work with distributed systems for

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,690
velocity I definitely think operations

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,370
types of people people that are behind

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,530
the scenes making sure systems are up

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,059
and running and definitely like F

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,850
developers trying to figure out how to

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,850
design their applications from us we

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,680
have managers VP's developers both front

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,420
end and back end I think there enough

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,250
talks for everybody where the kind of

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,570
the whole stack can be here attending

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,760
the conference and get something out fit

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,400
the topics tend to be really relevant

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,140
and I think thought-provoking more so

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,580
than other conferences I think I just

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,090
want to keep moving forward keep

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,820
learning

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,799
I have to go activate that O'Reilly

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,750
training that's really what I'm focused

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,869
on is just continuing to learn the whole

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,549
ecosystem hearing what everyone else is

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,770
working on and how they're solving

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,340
problems and being able to take that

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,070
back to my team

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,100
you

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,100
