	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
so you've completed the acquisition of

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,509
github how have things changed at

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,760
Microsoft since then well you know it's

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,880
interesting maybe not as much as you

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,840
might think so

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,700
things have been changing at Microsoft

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,890
for years I think that's obvious for us

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,270
my team is the Azure DevOps team we own

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,740
the DevOps tools that both we use

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,960
internally and that customers use but we

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,510
started our transformation our journey

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,140
Dom's path in about 2010 it was very

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,150
specific

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,219
it was our agile foundation agile

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,469
transformation to learn to actually move

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,559
fast the fact is at that point Microsoft

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,989
a very successful company doing a great

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,840
job at delivering box products every two

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,989
to three years was fantastic but guess

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,300
what at 2010 developers said if you're

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:49,980
gonna make me wait two years it's not

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,270
going to happen and we knew that so we

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,180
had to figure out how did you learn much

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,500
faster agile makes sense and that was

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,140
the foundation for we became our DevOps

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,329
journey which of course we're still on

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,370
now that's why it's not as big a change

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,750
because right now we're already

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,990
deploying at Microsoft about 82,000

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,970
times a day and we have about a hundred

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,909
thousand users internally on our DevOps

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,070
platform following similar practices my

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,299
team kind of led the way in a lot of

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,009
ways because we were part of the

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,030
developer group that had cater to

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,600
developers which were a little more

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,119
bleeding edge but now again it's a big

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,640
deal at Microsoft so so that gave us a

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,590
head start the github acquisition was

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,420
something regardless the acquisition we

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,950
were already doing

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,570
we regardless of whether we acquired

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,770
github we had to track what they were

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,040
doing it happened the kind of

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,170
communities they were in now in my team

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,790
itself my product area at her DevOps

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,850
there are definitely some things we did

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,430
because of or tracking with github from

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:55,470
a product and a community perspective

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,810
Azure DevOps has launched some amount of

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,840
rebranding it last September so if you

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,369
do the math the timeline before that

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,380
before that rebranding before that

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,479
launch we announced the acquisition of

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,390
github and afterwards we actually

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,039
acquired get up okay and at that point

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,050
we were all really well on our way the

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,650
product designs we did for Azure devops

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,780
in

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:21,090
did best-of-breed models that we see it

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,409
I get the idea that we have these things

00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,049
you can plug together whatever you need

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:26,790
so our thing we became we had a very

00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:29,250
solid integrated platform now it becomes

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,599
very used the pieces you want

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,280
don't use the pieces you don't want plug

00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,040
in other pieces so it's very common for

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,750
us to see people using our azure board's

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,780
technologies with github for example

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,799
with Azure pipelines deploying to well

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,760
hopefully I serve me someplace else

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,950
beyond that there are a lot of other

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,510
investments from a github perspective

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,720
we've done an integration work with

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,170
github we partner very closely with them

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,000
we've adopted or enabled view use of

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,010
their identity system with our Azure

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,260
platform so a lot of things there and in

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,239
fact even github has has added some

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,340
things that work well with us ok and

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,129
does that mean you're trying to change

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,950
the direction for github or folding them

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:13,409
into Microsoft oh no no thank you

00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,780
no no our management has made very clear

00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:18,780
that would be a very bad thing to do

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:20,430
github is owned by Microsoft but they

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,970
are very much softer on that treatment

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,209
is the CEO he transitioned from the open

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,739
source space xamarin into Microsoft nice

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,720
back out doing the stuff he loves

00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,090
supporting the open source community and

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,500
I think that's worked very well we are

00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,750
like I said partnering very closely

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,699
github has tons of partners or one of

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,239
them we have tons of partners github is

00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,019
one of ours

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,269
so github is doing what they need you to

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,510
be successful and that's what we want I

00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:50,370
will also say it's interesting that

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,409
after the acquisition so kind of getting

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,190
your original question I've seen a lot

00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:57,419
of things change at github I think that

00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,010
until the acquisition they weren't 100%

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,989
sure what they needed to do right now

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,190
they've been delivering lots of value

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,549
taking care of lots of customer needs

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,530
very quickly and I as a user I love it

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,909
I can see them evolving and serving

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,340
their customer base much better so I

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:12,720
think it's a really good thing ok so it

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,729
sounds like you're maintaining two

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,609
different companies that are both have

00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:21,599
competing products supporting DevOps is

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:24,419
that an issue huh well competing I guess

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:26,099
in some ways they're competing I don't

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,460
know if I'd look at that way in some

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,810
ways they're complementary again best

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,610
to breed the ability to use their

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,470
products and our products together we

00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,669
love that or whatever it is that the

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,520
customer needs we came from different

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:39,220
backgrounds we have different audiences

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,319
that that are drawn to us and as a

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,020
result we can deliver some amount of

00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:45,190
overlap but doing different ways so

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,430
whatever's good for the customer so I

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,560
mean little competition is good and the

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,169
fact is I think this is great for us and

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,270
great for customers and what about your

00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,240
predictions for the next year mm-hmm

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,349
so if I were to look forward I'd say the

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,840
only thing constant as you know it's

00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:05,110
change I think we're gonna have a lot of

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,880
change continuing in terms of specifics

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,229
I know in our area we can to invest

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,840
heavily in the container space

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:14,139
kubernetes I expected a lot of evolution

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,240
there and I'm not a high percent sure

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,860
but I expect we're gonna can you see

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,000
great things out of github and I know

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,259
we're contain to move fast and I think

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,389
it's gonna be a great year for DevOps

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,470
great thank you thanks so much for your

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,470
