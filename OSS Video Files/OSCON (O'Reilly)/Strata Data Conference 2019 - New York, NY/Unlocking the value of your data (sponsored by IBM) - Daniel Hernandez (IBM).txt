Title: Unlocking the value of your data (sponsored by IBM) - Daniel Hernandez (IBM)
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Organizations recognize that data is what fuels digital transformation and are looking for new ways to unlock the value of their data and accelerate their journey to AI. Thatâ€™s why 80% of business leaders view AI as a strategic opportunity. Yet only 19% understand the data required for AI. Simply put: There is no AI without IA (information architecture). Daniel Hernandez takes a deep dive into how, with a unified, prescriptive information architecture, organizations can successfully unlock the value of their data for an AI and multicloud world.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,919
I'm gonna commit all of my time that I

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:12,150
have onstage to utterly and completely

00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:14,130
boring you I'm so committed to doing

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,430
this that I changed our pedestrian

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,900
unlocking the value of a I title and

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,850
changed it to making AI boring because

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,100
if any of us have the ambition to unlock

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,470
the value of data we're likely exploring

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,029
AI to get that done and I hope that make

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,340
an argument that you find convincing

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,570
that the only way we're gonna get this

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,469
done at scale is by making AI boring it

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,520
so for sure

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:42,059
I should have caused you a bit of a head

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,350
twist when I said that but I want you to

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,010
stay with me because there is

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,570
significant power in boredom if we

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,000
willed it correctly I want you to

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,320
consider for instance when your last

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,480
major breakthrough came was it when you

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,960
had the space to think creatively and

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,680
let your mind settle I bet you that it

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,930
did I want you to think about seminal

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,310
works of art like scott adams random

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,330
acts of management that you might have

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,630
read in order to be an extraordinary and

00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:19,560
inspiring leader i want you to think

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:23,640
about the last time you had to get ready

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,570
for a wedding and learn to get jiggy

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,970
with it by modeling behavior from

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,119
youtube it's likely to have been

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,299
catalyzed when you were bored and so

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:41,610
boredom is a very powerful feature of

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:45,270
our day-to-day lives but in tech i don't

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:48,710
think we value boredom enough it's like

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:54,360
the late great Rodney Dangerfield said

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,710
boring absolutely gets no respect and so

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,829
I'm on a mission to absolutely change

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,170
that my goal in life at least in my

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:07,799
professional life is to make AI boring

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,450
let's consider what this means I want

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,890
you to imagine a future when AI is

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:16,360
boring and consider the

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,330
it would ought to be the tedious work

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,040
from our day-to-day lives you only have

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,370
to look at your calendar and see how

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,340
you're spending your day to value this

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:30,160
particular outcome what it would mean is

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,140
that people including many that you lead

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,150
would be able to focus on work that

00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:39,849
matters it would mean that problems are

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:44,230
consistently and automatically resolved

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:47,319
time and time again which means for the

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:51,160
customers which for-profit institutions

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:54,670
exist we could deliver amazing customer

00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,410
experiences on any channel no matter how

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,299
our customers are interacting with us

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:05,250
and if it's boring it becomes used by

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:09,160
everyone including the very people that

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:13,480
technology today unfortunately often

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:18,730
ignores and so what is it going to take

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:21,370
for us to make AI boring it comes down

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:25,060
to simply making it easy to build and

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:26,829
deploy is easier said than done of

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,660
course because if you consider the

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:32,049
entire lifecycle of building and

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:36,790
deploying the AI it's a very technical

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:39,340
domain available to those that have the

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:43,000
strong and advanced technical skills to

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,489
pull it off and if you consider

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,150
something like a customer onboarding

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,260
scenario within a bank you have dozens

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,819
of models that need to be orchestrated

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,769
in order for you to do this with AI and

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,620
yet a single data scientist with the

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:04,180
right skill will spend days weeks often

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,480
months building a single AI model this

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,430
is a significant amount of time

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,060
significant expense and drawing from a

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,910
pool of resources that are not large so

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,370
we need to do better the good news is

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,630
many of you that are working for

00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,669
technology companies who are

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,340
contributing to open source or doing

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,139
something about it there's an abundance

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:29,110
of options that we have

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,340
our figure tips for building AI most of

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,930
it just a couple clicks away from Google

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,569
available and open-source and in our

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,509
favorite languages and there are

00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:42,960
research and R&D labs by commercial

00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,969
companies like IBM that are plowing

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,150
significant dollars in trying to make

00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:50,770
this just the slightest bit easier I'm

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,080
excited about three projects we have

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,819
going on in IBM last year we introduced

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,590
a computer that could debate with humans

00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:59,710
which is basically a computer that can

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:04,900
reason cure rebuttals calibrate their

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,389
argument and buy some human judges more

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,729
effective debaters than human beings on

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:11,289
certain subject matters there's a

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:13,210
project that we have that just got

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:15,849
commercialized into Watson called Watson

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:19,000
AI what it attempts to do is automate as

00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:21,490
much of that AI lifecycle as is possible

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,849
and we're able to take not just model

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,939
build but deploy responsibilities and

00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:30,879
break it down from days and weeks to

00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:34,990
minutes and hours but there's also an

00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:37,569
important body of work that you that was

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,819
touched on earlier in the keynote about

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,589
fairness and we've introduced some

00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:43,000
algorithms that are now available for

00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,099
you to consume so that you could test

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,289
your models for common characteristics

00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,789
of fairness and do something about it

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:53,580
when it detects that there might be

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:56,800
something amiss but there is bad news

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,930
despite those abundance of options for

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,149
that abundance of options for building

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,689
AI the truth of the matter is you could

00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:07,029
build all day long models but they need

00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:08,740
data and if your data isn't ready you

00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:11,050
might as well stay home don't spend any

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,139
money at all is just waste we like to

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,909
say that there is no AI without a a so

00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,779
the question then becomes what to do

00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:21,279
about it for an approach we've

00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,529
introduced something we called the AI

00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:27,430
ladder it's a set of architectural

00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:28,960
principles it's a way of work it's a set

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,759
of considerations that you should be

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,250
making if you're planning for AI

00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,159
projects related to your information

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,080
architecture to ensure that not only can

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,880
you train these models but you could put

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,360
them into

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,670
into the wild essentially what it

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,710
prescribes is a series of four steps you

00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,680
need methods to collect organize analyze

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,290
your data once you do that you need

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,420
methods to build deploy and inject these

00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,190
models into business critical processes

00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,350
and if you have this information

00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,880
architecture it does you no good if it's

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,050
in limited operating environment so you

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:07,470
need it to run everywhere the big bet

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,210
for IBM is that we can deliver this AI

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:11,670
ladder through a product we introduced

00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:14,040
last year called cloud pack for data and

00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:17,220
what you could think of it as is a full

00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,350
data and AI stack adhering to those four

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,020
critical architectural principles I

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,250
enumerated through in the eye ladder

00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,460
that has everything you need to build

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:31,760
and deploy AI in the wild anywhere you

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:35,010
want to run AWS I sure Google IBM and

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,510
your own private data center we've

00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,780
perfected the technology so it could be

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,520
up and running in minutes in your

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,120
production workloads and even in the

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,270
hairiest scenarios we can get it ready

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,550
for you in less than four hours and

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,600
inside it has watson which serves two

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,880
purposes

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,640
it's your tool chain for building

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,530
deploying and managing AI and it's a set

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,390
of applications that allow you to have a

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,150
ready-made solution for things like

00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:07,440
customer and employee care and financial

00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:10,740
crimes so the combination of this

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,220
approach and the technology we built are

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,800
doing their part in helping customers

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,060
deploy AI we've got over 10,000

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,700
engagements that we're quite proud of

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,460
and this is accelerating every day so we

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,870
know we're on to something I'm quite

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,020
excited about some of the work that we

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,210
did with IQ which is allowing doctors to

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,380
deliver acute care and remote regions of

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,750
India because of AI as well as

00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,370
personally the fantasy football app on

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,200
ESPN that lets me make sure that my

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,599
roster on any particular week is going

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,360
to beat the crap out of my competition

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,880
so a lot of examples we got a lot of

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,990
momentum and you are doing your bit to

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,050
help us along the way and so

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:58,670
I hope I made you just the slightest bit

00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:01,400
bored and if I did and if you found this

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,130
particular argument convincing help us

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,080
make AI boring together and if you want

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,300
to understand some of the how behind the

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
technology I was just describing visit

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:13,630
us in 9:15

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,630
come see me at 11:20 thank you very much

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,690
