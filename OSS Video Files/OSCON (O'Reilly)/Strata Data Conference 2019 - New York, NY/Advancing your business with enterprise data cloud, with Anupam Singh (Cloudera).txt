hi Roger McGough is from O'Reilly here

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,990
with Anna pom Singh who's the chief

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,469
customer officer for cloud era welcome

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,090
hi how are you so in this world of data

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,160
customer certainly faced a lot of

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,289
challenges and making things work it's

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,789
been a topic for many years what do you

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,930
think are the chief challenges that they

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,170
face so every year the challenges change

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,599
this year when we talked to customers we

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,830
were with 50 customers yesterday for the

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,450
entire day the biggest challenge is

00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,579
business wants access to data really

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,790
really quickly they want it fast they

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:42,480
want it now they want it today and IT

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,210
seems to be blocking that access almost

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,760
saying what about security

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,829
what about governance where do you want

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,100
to run it what location is best for you

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,969
so there's this tension between central

00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,539
IT and line of businesses around getting

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:05,220
to insights faster right so Clara just

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:09,240
announced the enterprise data cloud what

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,710
exactly does that consist of so the the

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,560
biggest thing about enterprise data

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,950
cloud is to think from the perspective

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,299
of that tension between line of business

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,009
and IT the first is we all agree that

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,590
there are many form factors right now

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,780
you could run it on public cloud you

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,290
could run it on private cloud you could

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,939
run it on Prem so a big characteristic a

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,740
big attribute of it is you should be

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,200
able to run anywhere businesses are

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,729
complex they can choose to run anywhere

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,100
so the hybrid nature of a data

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,250
management platform is an interim part

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,430
and add to it the second one is you and

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,290
I know we've grown in this space sequel

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,350
was the only way to work with data 10

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,899
years ago remember that time and now

00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:00,689
kids right Python right so imagine a

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,820
platform where you want to be able to

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,200
write Python programs as well as sequel

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,840
programs you want to do machine learning

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,340
you want to do databases both of them

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,610
should work so the second attribute

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,890
would be multi-function analytics the

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,380
third one is what all of us worry

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,570
every day we run some of the biggest

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,690
regulatory workloads in the world we run

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,330
the data platforms for a lot of telcos

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,530
that data is sensitive you wouldn't want

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:33,540
your phone calls your prescriptions your

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,300
credit card transactions to leak out so

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,190
being secure and governed irrespective

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,290
where it's running is the third biggest

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,970
attribute and force something that you

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:48,030
and I would identify with 100%

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:52,940
open-source not 96% 100% so for

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:56,370
attribute would be hybrid multifunction

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,160
governed and open-source so how does it

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,350
differ from the other cloud things out

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:05,100
there so one if you're a public cloud

00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:07,590
vendor you are by necessity working on

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,970
your cloud native platform so you cannot

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:15,120
be multi cloud if you're focused on just

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,280
one cloud if you're a sequel database

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,739
vendor who wants to build a warehouse on

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,230
the public cloud what's the first word I

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,030
use sequel what about all my Python

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,260
programmer friends are they banned from

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,790
working from data so there's there's

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:35,370
none necessity to be multi-function

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:37,530
secure and gone we've just invested 10

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,459
plus years at Cloudera

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:45,150
and hearten together to build some of

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,040
the best lineage and auditing engines so

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,989
a lot of cloud providers have been

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,910
focused on the infrastructure but they

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,820
haven't been able to build out their

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,350
security and governance software so we

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,380
are very different because we have done

00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,739
that for 10 plus years we are masterful

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:05,430
at doing it with banks and telcos and

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,170
finally in terms of open source the

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,959
moment you build a cloud service which

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,760
are black box which is a black box

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,940
you're already not open source even if

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,310
you profess to use Hadoop maybe or use

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,079
some open source stack the service is

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,280
not open source so that's how we

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,550
distinguish ourselves from

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,840
cloud native vendors so this needs to be

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,360
called strata plus a dupe world mm-hm

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,920
Hadoop has gotten some short shrift

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,230
recently but you've written a blog post

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,720
that's gotten a lot of attention yeah so

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,850
we have to ask is Hadoop dead yeah

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,680
people are often confuse me for our own

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,830
Morty Aaron is the one who wrote the

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,810
blog post but when we were writing the

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,850
blog post our focus was to talk about

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,490
the philosophy what's the philosophy of

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,900
Hadoop it's a disaggregated stack so

00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,720
that you don't have one language that

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:03,670
rules them all it is meant to be taken

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,200
apart so to speak because it's open

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,990
source so for us Hadoop as a community

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:16,540
as an effort as an initiative is a

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:19,510
philosophy and it actually was the start

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,390
of many of these things that you see in

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,490
enterprise data cloud many of the things

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,040
that you see around being able to run

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,990
your data platform anywhere when you are

00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,669
when you're open when you have a

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,669
disaggregated stack you can move it

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:36,220
around you want to go on it the best way

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:41,080
to have a garden able stack is it should

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,090
be open so the philosophy continues for

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,710
example if you have swiped your credit

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,470
card since the morning if you bought

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:52,660
coffee if you took a car or here in all

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:56,890
cases you've already used for do 20

00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:03,850
times since the morning so to say that

00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:06,580
Hadoop is dead or alive is is we are not

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,410
giving enough credit to a great open

00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,020
source community that is successfully

00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,870
ingrained itself into almost all our

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,640
daily activities well there's a great

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,480
article by Kevin Kelly around that no

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,400
technology ever really dies yes

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:26,320
and once it reaches the kind of adoption

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,350
that we've had you know top 10 banks top

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,160
10 telcos healthcare government

00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:36,260
everywhere

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:40,040
we own our our customers put all their

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:43,760
trust into our data platform and there's

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:47,300
we've seen easily banks of 100-plus

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,520
petabytes on Hadoop so the technology is

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,830
not going anywhere it just needs to

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,000
evolve right well thanks a lot for your

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,000
time thank you very much

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,690
