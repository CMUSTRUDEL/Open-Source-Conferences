Roger McGough is here with J Doherty

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,390
data scientist at data I crew welcome

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,760
thank you very much what why is the

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,650
final mile such a challenge for so many

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,429
organizations who are working on AI and

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,690
machine learning really is there's a few

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,660
different reasons that I see very

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,689
regularly one is obviously around

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,890
governance so basically the ability to

00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,630
continue to track the quality of that

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,740
model over time something a lot of

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,449
people don't think about oftentimes when

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,769
you're building a data set or you're

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,910
building and putting together some data

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,070
set that you gonna build a model with

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,380
afterwards you have it's nice and

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,260
labeled okay great I build my model at

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,510
one time but I've never thought about

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,329
how I'm gonna keep track in the future

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,829
of how well it's actually doing how do I

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,950
get the information of the ground truth

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,960
to compare my model against it's it's a

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,239
tricky feedback loop that you have to

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,219
build into your workflow and it's it's

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,510
hard to do it gets harder the either the

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,719
more rare the thing you're trying to

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,670
predict is or the longer it takes for

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,350
you to be proven right or wrong so I'm

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,700
trying to predict loans or something

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,970
like that will somebody default on a

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,740
loan

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,060
you might not know for 10 years if your

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,460
prediction was correct or not so how do

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,909
you feed that back into the model very

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,189
challenging question just to follow up

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:21,750
on that it also seems like production is

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,250
like a new thing for a lot of analysts

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,150
yeah I was in the past they were just

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,200
building something it was yeah that's

00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:32,250
definitely the case so that's even like

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,320
at a simpler level is okay I built

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,000
something that worked one time when I

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,189
ran all the cells in my Jupiter notebook

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,470
in the correct order how the heck do I

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,329
turn this into something that somebody's

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,100
going to rely on large corporations

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,920
gonna rely on for their revenue every

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,390
day huge gap there and a lot of the

00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,420
there's a lot of tools being developed

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,860
right now kind of taking a couple

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,070
different approaches to bridging that

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,579
gap one thing that we've seen a lot of

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,250
lately is work on top of git

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,200
specifically so alright I have I've

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,179
built something in a notebook I now want

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,860
to productionize this somehow and it's

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,400
like oh we're gonna make another layer

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,750
of complication on top of

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,909
yeah which is already incredibly

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,470
complicated you're isolating the number

00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,360
of people who could ever use this kind

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:24,250
of tool down to people who already get

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,530
yet which is like 10 of them then - that

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,030
you learn another tool on top of that

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,799
the other way that we see folks going

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,159
and this is the way that J ty ku has

00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,840
been kind of pushing for is making sure

00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,360
that you're working within a framework

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,220
as you're building the model that is

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,989
already prepared to push out whatever

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,150
you've created into a production

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,799
environment so instead of building an

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,230
isolation and then figuring out some way

00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:49,569
the tool you're working in has that

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,310
built in right what are some other

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,859
considerations that might be overlooked

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,680
by people trying to move forward so a

00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:58,420
lot of people when they're looking at

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,040
how to judge you know the number one

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,379
question that I get these days is how do

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,440
I know if my model is good right should

00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:08,319
I just take our to score should I take a

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,579
you see what what does it mean for a

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,459
given model to know if it's good or not

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:16,739
and I think the actual best way to

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:19,630
decide whether or not a model is good is

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,480
to have the business interest directly

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,849
plugged into that decision so instead of

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,639
saying my accuracy is very high right

00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:31,389
you should instead say how much money do

00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,549
I gain from each prediction or lose if I

00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:35,139
can't answer whether I'm gaining or

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,579
losing money from a given prediction

00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,599
that I shouldn't put that model into

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,079
production I shouldn't even think about

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,910
it so going into production what are the

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,459
kind of options for deployment for

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,230
moving from that development phase to

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,239
getting things out there so there's kind

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,569
of two different ways that models get or

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,449
models get productionize dry now one is

00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:57,669
real-time so this means every time a new

00:03:55,449 --> 00:04:00,069
action happens or a new record gets

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,780
collected that record gets sent us a

00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:04,329
model and it gets scored one at a time

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,970
the other way would be batch scoring so

00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,190
here I have some model that I've built

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,949
and every night or every week or every

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,660
so often it takes all of the records

00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:15,940
that have been collected scores them all

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,459
and gives you a response based on what

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,039
your needs are you're going to be either

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,240
deploying as a batch process or in

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,060
real-time

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,550
for real time the hot thing right now is

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,440
deploying API endpoints across a

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,740
kubernetes cluster for example this way

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,449
you have huge scalability you have

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,750
failover you have the ability to upgrade

00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,070
each individual node at one at a time so

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,949
you could always have a hundred percent

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,120
uptime that's the fun stuff data Ike who

00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:46,870
makes that as easy as a click of a

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,400
button but there's also a lot of you

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,410
know roll your own kind of tools to do

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,760
that type of thing right so since you

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,400
work with a lot of companies that are

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,830
doing AI you probably developed a kind

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,030
of a checklist of best practices what

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,680
would you say those are so I think I've

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,770
sort of alluded to a few of them there

00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,320
but one is understand how you're gonna

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,630
track your models quality have a real

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,410
game plan in place when you deploy your

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,150
model on to understand what value your

00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,590
model is bringing from a revenue

00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,560
standpoint not from an accuracy

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,010
standpoint and then 3 make sure that

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,210
your model can be updated and redeployed

00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,729
seamlessly so that your business it

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:31,060
doesn't have downtime each time you need

00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:32,560
to change something so given this

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,849
background we got people working on

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,960
stuff how does something like that I

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:40,419
could help people work done so did I COO

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,580
as a end-to-end platform allows people

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,669
to work within the tool to build out

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,270
either batch process or API endpoints

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,820
models and deploy each of them

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,680
seamlessly along with the monitoring to

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,810
ingest data through that feedback loop I

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,449
was talking about and redeploy across

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,110
your cluster without any downtime the

00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,880
only did I - also provides a lot of

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,800
features around tracking your models

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,810
quality not just giving you a single

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,030
score like accuracy or a single score

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,250
like precision recall anything like that

00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,830
but a wide variety of tools to really

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,060
understand how your model is doing what

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,710
I'm talking about revenue we even

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,690
provide the ability to include a cost

00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,160
matrix so that you can understand the

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,220
dollar amount that your models going to

00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,720
be helping or hurting you right now in

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,520
the world of AI of course one of the

00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,380
things that people often talk about is

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,500
how ethics fairness and bias

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:37,120
so forth fits into the equation what is

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:41,230
the data IQ taken all that we believe

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,050
that ethics and fairness and removing

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,430
bias come through transparency of the

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,990
development process and models

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,630
themselves as well as through

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,160
collaboration on those processes the

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,960
development process just like a model

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,220
shouldn't be a black box the development

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,930
process of that model shouldn't be

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,240
either and it shouldn't be something

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,820
that only one person that genius in the

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
room has built everything and he or she

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,270
is the only one who knows how it works

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,070
having a tool like data iku that

00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,830
provides openness and collaboration

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,360
across your entire company makes it so

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,070
that you know your model when it's put

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,650
into place when it's released into the

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,630
world has had many eyes on it and it's

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,200
not reflecting the inherent biases or

00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,610
ethical dilemmas of a single human being

00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,670
well thanks for your time today thank

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,670
you

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,419
