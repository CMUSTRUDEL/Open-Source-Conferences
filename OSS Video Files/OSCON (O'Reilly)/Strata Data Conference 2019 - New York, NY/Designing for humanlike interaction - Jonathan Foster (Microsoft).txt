Title: Designing for humanlike interaction - Jonathan Foster (Microsoft)
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Language shapes our thinking, our relationships, our sense of self. Conversation connects us in powerful, intimate, and often unconscious ways. Jonathan Foster explains why, as we design for natural language interactions and more humanlike digital experiences, language—as design material, conversation, and design canvas—reveals ethical challenges we couldn’t encounter with GUI-powered experiences.

Simply put, designers cannot tell people what to say or how to say it, and yet we need to ensure our products don’t perpetuate bad behavior. We need a new kind of design thinking around AI.
