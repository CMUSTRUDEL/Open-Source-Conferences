Title: Designing for humanlike interaction - Jonathan Foster (Microsoft)
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Language shapes our thinking, our relationships, our sense of self. Conversation connects us in powerful, intimate, and often unconscious ways. Jonathan Foster explains why, as we design for natural language interactions and more humanlike digital experiences, language—as design material, conversation, and design canvas—reveals ethical challenges we couldn’t encounter with GUI-powered experiences.

Simply put, designers cannot tell people what to say or how to say it, and yet we need to ensure our products don’t perpetuate bad behavior. We need a new kind of design thinking around AI.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,370
for my team we were very concerned about

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,830
the impact we're having on human lives

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,510
so we approach this with a set of

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,849
principles we started building them out

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,860
and it's rather extensive it started

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,389
with my Cortana work it now extends into

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,789
the personality chat work that I'm doing

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,279
today for bot developers and this is

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,850
only four examples but I want to go over

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,080
them briefly for you here so digital

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,990
transparency I'm going to go over each

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,470
in detail digital transparency don't

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,820
create opportunities for bad behavior

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,860
strive for inclusivity of course

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,530
inclusive design is huge in the industry

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,410
and very important to Microsoft and

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,840
embrace sensitivity so digital

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,370
transparency means that we make sure

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,860
people know they're dealing with a

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,100
digital experience 100% of the time

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,350
so early on in our work we put a stake

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,449
in the ground and said reject the Turing

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,239
test we do not want to prove the worth

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,920
of our work through duping humans into

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,290
believing that they're dealing with a

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,850
human don't perpetuate bad behavior it

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,970
may not it may not come as any surprise

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,670
to anyone here but when we get this data

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,650
we see a lot of ugly behavior I mean the

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,400
darkest behavior that humans can come up

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,009
with racism sexism gender stereotyping

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,439
abuse all kinds of things and we know

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,320
that because in an interaction model

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,720
that's conversational a non-response is

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,729
a response so you have no choice but to

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,259
come up with something so we had to come

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,030
up with a strategy on how to deal with

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,509
this we can't get into the game of

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,799
shaming people Microsoft can tell

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:41,220
Microsoft cannot tell people what they

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,770
can and cannot say however it's

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,649
incumbent upon all of us to ensure that

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,140
we're not creating products that can

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,850
perpetuate bad behavior so we came up

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,979
with a principled approach that

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,990
essentially said we understand what

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,820
you're saying we're not going to go

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,500
there and there's nothing interesting

00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,729
here we didn't want to create a clever

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,649
way to say that because we didn't want

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,869
to turn it into a parlor game that we

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,939
get people doing terrible things into

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,939
their devices at cocktail parties

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,800
inclusivity that's a huge one and I call

00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,570
out humor here because

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,480
my personal belief that a lot of us make

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,980
mistakes with regards to inclusion when

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,410
we're trying to be funny we're just

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,050
trying to be funny so we really have to

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,030
dial back and really keep above our

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,980
desire to make people laugh and have joy

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,410
we have to keep an eye on this idea of

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,410
are we marginalizing anyone and here's

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:37,950
an example it's also kind of how we deal

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,440
with the darker side if we see something

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:43,470
that says you are fat and if we dismiss

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,200
it or if we we make a joke about it or

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:49,320
we get defensive we are empowering body

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,600
shaming in that moment so we chose the

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:57,210
path of just hitting it head-on

00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:00,180
you're right and finally here embracing

00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,890
sensitivity we also see besides all this

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,710
darkness we see people sharing very

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,720
personal things about themselves secrets

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,730
and and they want opinions and things

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,290
that we can't provide but just because

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,870
we can't provide them any help or

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,210
assurance or a pat on the back what we

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,700
can do is acknowledge in our writing

00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,830
that we hear them and that it's okay to

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,830
express these things in this experience

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,950
