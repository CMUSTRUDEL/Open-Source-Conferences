Description: 
	AI has the potential to add $16 trillion global economy by 2030, but adoption has been slow. While we understand the power of AI, many of us aren’t sure how to fully unleash its potential. Join Robert Thomas and Tim O’Reilly to learn that the reality is AI isn’t magic. It’s hard work. There’s no wand to be waved at enterprise inefficiencies, and having the technology alone is not enough. AI breakthroughs will come with mass experimentation, and while many of those experiments will fail, the successful ones will have substantial impact. AI can help you, your business, your employees, and your customers, but you need a prescriptive approach to harness its power and put AI to work.
