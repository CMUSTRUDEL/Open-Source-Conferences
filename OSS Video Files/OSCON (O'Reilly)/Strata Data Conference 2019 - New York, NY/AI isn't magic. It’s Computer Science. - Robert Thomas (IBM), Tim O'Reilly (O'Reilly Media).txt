Title: AI isn't magic. It’s Computer Science. - Robert Thomas (IBM), Tim O'Reilly (O'Reilly Media)
Publication date: 2019-09-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	AI has the potential to add $16 trillion global economy by 2030, but adoption has been slow. While we understand the power of AI, many of us aren’t sure how to fully unleash its potential. Join Robert Thomas and Tim O’Reilly to learn that the reality is AI isn’t magic. It’s hard work. There’s no wand to be waved at enterprise inefficiencies, and having the technology alone is not enough. AI breakthroughs will come with mass experimentation, and while many of those experiments will fail, the successful ones will have substantial impact. AI can help you, your business, your employees, and your customers, but you need a prescriptive approach to harness its power and put AI to work.

	00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,640
so let's come back to the so this idea

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,880
of the latter as sort of just sort of

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,160
breaking down this you know the set of

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,009
things and capabilities you need to

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,060
build for your company what skills do

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,070
our company's most lacking typically and

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,750
what infrastructure are they most

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,460
lacking when you're talking about you

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,859
know all lion enterprise companies that

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,630
are saying well we want to get us some

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,730
of that AI stuff what do we do you know

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,860
there was a there was a report McKinsey

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,710
report two weeks ago that said global

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,480
shortage of data scientist is 250,000

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,950
and is going to get worse yeah so

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,950
without a doubt there's a shortage of

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,640
data science skills yeah and you know

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,870
that's Python you know if you want your

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,850
kids to have a job to have them learn

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,820
Python to guaranteed guaranteed

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,710
employment for a long time so there's

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,660
there's the whole realm of data science

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,520
there's certainly a gap we can solve a

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,190
lot of that through AI that builds AI

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,780
things like if we can automate feature

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,960
engineering which we're doing right now

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,880
inside of Watson or automate algorithm

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,420
selection you can actually make that you

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,130
can you can narrow that skill gap that's

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,640
a channel infrastructure I don't see as

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,350
a big issue a great benefit of the cloud

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,420
world we live in is you can kind of get

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,340
whatever you want right but our company

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,890
is already over that hump of kind of

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,439
getting to the cloud where they have

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,930
easy access to computation and data for

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,000
the level they need I see a pretty big

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,579
reluctance to take I'll call it core

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,070
data sensitive data and move that to

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,920
cloud still to public cloud that's why

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,320
we do a lot with private cloud on RedHat

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,119
that type of thing but I think if you

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,009
mask those data sets then you can do

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,130
experimentation that goes back to data

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,500
organization mask protect sensitive data

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,450
I see people slowly getting over that

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,490
hump but I think it will be a

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,159
combination of public cloud and private

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,799
cloud work for how they've done yeah so

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,030
we're running towards the end of our

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,330
time so let me just ask you for any

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,290
concluding thoughts if if you're in

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:16,110
front of a customer who really has not

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,980
thought about AI for their business they

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,379
are you know just starting to say well

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,609
well how is it different how will it

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,879
change things to me what do you tell

00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:29,040
them like first there's still a fear

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,379
factor on this topic I think you almost

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,510
have to acknowledge that and I tell

00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,230
clients AI is not going to replace

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,090
managers but managers that use AI are

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,090
going to replace the managers that do

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,099
not and they've really got to think of

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,870
this as if your competition is using

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,060
this and you're not you're not going to

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,939
be relevant and so you kinda have to

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,879
I'd say dispel the fear but then wake

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,400
people up that that now is the time we

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,939
we've kind of gotten through the hype

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,209
phase of AI now is when the real work

00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,129
starts and it's hard and it's

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:08,129
fundamental challenges around data and

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:10,859
culture and skills those things that we

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:14,430
talked about but now is the time and if

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:16,919
you're gonna wait another year or 24

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,540
months to get started you may be too

00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,540
late yeah so now is the time

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,459
