hi I'm Roger McGough I'm here with Siva

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,680
Siva Kumar who's senior director data

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,690
center solutions at Cisco welcome thank

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,070
you it's a pleasure to be here so what

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,559
kind of problems is the Cisco data

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,580
Intelligence Platform hoping to address

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,510
for customers the way we are looking at

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,560
this space there in big data meets AI if

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,960
you will

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,820
customers have built a lot of like

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,369
platforms like you know data lakes and

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,500
stuff that are quite well done today and

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,420
there is a lot of innovation in the

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,860
application space in the AI space where

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,570
there is containerized applications

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,030
being evolved and models developed and

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,649
things of that nature and then there is

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,540
the there is the cloud where there is a

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,809
huge amount of work happening as well as

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,680
cloud providing a large data repository

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,320
clear as well

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,440
this whole goal or the mission of data

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,239
intelligence platform is to provide much

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,510
more of a connected system approach

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,480
something that brings it all together so

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,809
that the experience of worrying about

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,060
the underlying platforms is taken care

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,640
that's fundamentally what we are doing

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,350
but we of course are building it in such

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,630
a way so we can enable an ecosystem on

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,689
top of that so so what is the approach

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:19,110
you're using to the solution so you know

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:21,229
we have in in the Cisco data center

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,930
journey in our in the way we do things

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:26,790
we have had a long-running history of

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,579
building out really really good

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,650
solutions out of Cisco which actually

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,960
not only brings together a plethora of

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,400
Cisco cutting-edge technologies

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,049
world-class technologies but also

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,119
integrating partners along the journey

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,369
so this is one more of a a comprehensive

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,700
approach to building out a data center

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:50,430
solution with work with cloud era and

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,520
other partners in this space so that we

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,200
really look at this as what does IT want

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,750
what does a data scientist one how do

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,450
customers want to consume this how can

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,770
we look at things from that lens and

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,020
build the capabilities underneath

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,790
provide the agility flexibility and

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,200
things like that you need because the

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,580
amount of data we are moving these days

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,860
is just mind-boggling

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,710
you have to do something about it

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,830
underneath so we look at those type of

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,720
aspects of data movement capacity

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,690
management you know tearing and things

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,700
of that nature combine it with

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,150
infrastructure flexibility GPU CPUs all

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,950
kinds of infrastructure capabilities and

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,870
that's that's truly how the platform

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,820
underneath is architected to deliver

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,430
that seamless experience on the next

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,250
layer so there's a lot of imaginative

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,990
speculation around AI it's a funny kind

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,850
of hype filled world although I would

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,880
say at this conference we're hearing a

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:46,200
kind of real-world issues what are the

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,570
real life struggles that you see

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,280
companies facing around AI so AI has has

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,860
really captured our imagination in terms

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,750
of the art of possible what all you

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,230
could do in that in the space of the

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:06,060
technology but bringing AI to everyday

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,850
industrializing AI making it making it

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,010
consumable making it work and not just

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,320
only the data scientists can understand

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,680
but the common man can get to it that's

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,010
truly the crossing the chasm if you will

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,070
and I think that's where we are taking

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:27,230
the right kind of steps to making

00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:30,240
several aspects of industrializing AI of

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,980
making it much more commercialized in

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,980
democratic for everybody to be able to

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,530
use in this type of journey I think the

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,910
EIS is such a fascinating area it's just

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,580
so much you can do with it

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,350
but you got to you got to take it to the

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,070
people you got to get it done that

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,420
that's really what we think is where our

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:51,210
contribution is going to be in providing

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,770
the capability so how do you expect to

00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,340
evolve to keep up with what's going on

00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,050
it certainly is a fast-paced world

00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,200
totally so I think the the the journey

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:03,060
if you will we have we have been at this

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,580
for some time but I think we have truly

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,900
gotten this off the ground we actually

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,750
announced the solution for the first

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,390
time at Cisco live a couple months ago

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,000
and and we are really seeing a first

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,430
wave of solutions now with with with

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,770
what with cloud it up and then ask the

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,140
CD PR cloud at a data platform you know

00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:25,320
evolves over time we certainly think

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,870
that'll be a big influx point where we

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,690
will actually bring the

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,460
on top of the solution we are besides

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,520
cloud era there are other use cases we

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,970
are looking at as well and one of the

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,080
key things we have done is develop much

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,850
more of a single pane of glass

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,290
management for the infrastructure so

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,260
it's a very heterogeneous world out

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,210
there so we are and that would be

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,460
through Cisco technology called Cisco

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,320
inter-site so inner sight is a is a

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,630
cloud-based management platform that can

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,520
really allow you to look at all your

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,310
infrastructure in a in a in a holistic

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,350
fashion have the ability to top

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,910
application on top of that on the

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,810
infrastructure so you can actually have

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:08,930
a easy way to deploy things that are

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,930
that are unavailable so we think as part

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,970
of our journey building solution that

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,610
take advantage of the latest innovation

00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,310
in the industry in the software world

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,770
along with turnkey automation journey

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,960
that we are on already bring those

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,669
capabilities and having customers take

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,190
advantage of this is truly where we

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:30,410
think our next in a generation of

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,919
technology in this space would be yeah

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:37,220
that having a single pane I'm curious is

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,729
there any AI behind that interestingly

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:43,550
the entire inner sight platform is an AI

00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:45,710
engine it is actually self learning it

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,810
is able to actually predict how your

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:52,190
platform behaviors are and this is going

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,990
this is AI at an everyday IT level so if

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,180
you had certain signatures that your

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,610
drive or your drive underneath or your

00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,919
firmware underneath is shaky eventually

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,660
it is going to fail is something we can

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,160
actually look at look into that and say

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,289
you know this these signals these

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,630
symptoms means you may have something

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,930
down the road so that predictive nature

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,780
of guiding you and and looking at the

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,789
what-ifs is part of the inner side

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,919
journey as well so it is absolutely an

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:22,039
AI build platform and it is all built on

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,620
kubernetes it says it's all DevOps and

00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:26,389
weekly releases and that kind of journey

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,460
so pretty excited about that

00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,320
very interesting fascinating well thanks

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,740
for your time today oh absolutely my

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,190
pleasure

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,190
thank you

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,990
