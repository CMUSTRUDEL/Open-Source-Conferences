good okay so thank you Suzanne for your

introduction my name is Andrew Moline

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,950
gay as she mentioned I rep

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,560
zanko nation a techid nonprofit based in

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,430
New York City the Bay Area and in

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,459
Chicago we just are Chicago this year so

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,549
today I want to talk more about

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,610
diversity surprise because you know this

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:36,900
is the diversity lunch but I really

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:39,810
wanted to take this time to really level

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,000
set and understand have you all

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,519
understand what diversity means but also

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,299
to other words that are often thrown

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:52,620
around but are seldom understood so

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:55,530
those are equity and inclusion so I'm

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,629
gonna start with defining those terms

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,049
I'm also going to say talk about how

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,790
this creates a impact for the tech

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,590
industry and then talk about some

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:09,569
tangible solutions that you can take

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:12,180
away right after this lunch so let me

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,970
just first start off by asking everyone

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,920
on a scale of one to ten where are you

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,790
in your journey of understanding

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,269
diversity equity and inclusion one being

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,720
I have no idea what those words mean

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:32,940
and ten being you are like the Beyonce

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,970
of de I just shout them out we'll take

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:43,769
them seven okay that's pretty cool okay

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:46,319
yeah ten down here ten six okay all

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,629
right so you know we're all over the

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,370
place and you can keep your whatever

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:54,510
number you have in your head I heard you

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,519
so that's okay so I wanted to take this

00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,060
time to actually go over what each means

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:05,340
so diversity often is associated with

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,139
having an individual having respect for

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,379
individuals that are of different

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:13,680
backgrounds right most it's mostly

00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:15,599
associated with gender and race and

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,970
ethnicity but as you can just see this

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,760
picture there so there's so much more to

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:26,310
what diversity means and so it's not

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,570
only just your your background it's your

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,139
religious beliefs

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,110
it's

00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,969
your social economic status it's where

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,460
you grew up it's all these different

00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:38,520
factors that make you you and so

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,919
diversity is about not just tolerating

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,639
our differences but embracing them and

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:47,430
in a way that is conducive for everyone

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,310
to feel like themselves it's listening

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,650
to my next point

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,659
inclusion so I really love this quote

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,719
this quote says diversity is being

00:04:54,659 --> 00:05:01,490
invited to the party inclusion is being

00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:04,770
asked to dance and so when we talk about

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:08,430
diversity often the million-dollar

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:12,930
question is how can we get more folks of

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:15,599
color women in the tech industry but the

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,210
ten million dollar question here is how

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:21,949
can we keep them how can we and how can

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,779
we ensure that folks that are entering

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,330
careers fields that they are

00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,580
underrepresented how can they feel that

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,050
they can full show up as themselves in

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,460
that industry so that's what inclusion

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,189
is equity equity is often associated

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,029
with equality equality is a word that

00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:46,770
you know we all kind of aspire to have

00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:48,539
in our society equality is talking about

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,159
if everyone had the same thing we'll be

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:54,300
good right

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:59,580
equity is getting at the root causes of

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:02,849
what certain demographics will need to

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,889
overcome in order to achieve that

00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:08,000
equality so as you can see in the

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,889
picture everyone is given the same stole

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,740
personal on the right is not able to see

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:16,379
right so the person on the right in an

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,830
equity will need a taller stool and so

00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:24,719
equity is more focused your your framing

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:30,629
around what we can do to correct and

00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:33,689
address historical trauma and historical

00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:39,930
disadvantages of certain groups so I

00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:42,090
wanted to show a video oh I wanted to

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,930
show a quick video

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:52,860
get out of here really quick that kind

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,860
of shows what happens when we are not

00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,750
excuse me

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:03,100
okay well it's not showing so I'll tell

00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:06,370
you what happened because actually this

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:10,210
is a true story so imagine this I'm at a

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:13,030
conference something like this I had to

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,610
run to the restroom right all right go

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,890
to my steak and I put my hand under the

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,200
water water doesn't come out I'm like

00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,610
what the heck what am I supposed to do I

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,190
need to wash my hands so I can get back

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,600
to the conference and I'm sick I'm gonna

00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,390
stay in there and you know I eventually

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,010
was able to make it work I found like

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,070
you know some hand sanitizer or sink

00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,920
like outside in the kitchen but it

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,110
dawned on me I was like well I wonder if

00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,860
other people are having this problem and

00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,410
so when I wanted to find a an example of

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:48,550
what this could look like to show you

00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:52,240
all I googled it I was like sick not

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:54,250
working why and there were a lot of

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,340
different reasons and one of the reasons

00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,730
that popped up was that the sensors on

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,630
the sink were not detecting my darker

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:08,080
skin tone and so this video was actually

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,270
an example of how someone else noticed

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,360
that and he brought his white colleague

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,340
to the soap dispenser and he asked his

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,640
white colleagues to put his hand under

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,520
the soap dispenser and it came right and

00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,680
then he put his hand and like was not

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,750
working so he was like okay let me put

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,900
this paper towel this white paper towel

00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,640
let me put it here it worked and then he

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,840
put his hand back and so this is

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:38,410
actually a very tangible example right

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:43,330
of how if we're not being thoughtful of

00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:46,150
our of incorporating diversity equity

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,550
inclusion in our tech this can have

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:54,340
lasting impact on the world in ways that

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:55,430
are unintended right and so you can look

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,950
it up there's a

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,450
two articles on it but that's

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,810
essentially what it is and I kind of

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,220
explained what the video was in this

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,890
question I was supposed to ask you this

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:13,220
question but any thoughts on that just

00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:15,830
on thoughts it's okay no problem so this

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,390
kind of leads us to our next point of

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,300
just kind of laying it plain like what's

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:22,730
what's the problem with the tech

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:25,520
industry right now so less than 20% of

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,640
tech jobs are filled by women black and

00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Latin X professionals each make up about

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,920
7% each of the u.s. tech workforce and

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,240
so when we talk about this next number

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,120
which is a million jobs in second which

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,270
would be available next year who are

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,000
these jobs going to right so how are we

00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:52,339
as a society creating opportunities for

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,050
the 1.5 million jobs in software and web

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,040
development which is one of the largest

00:09:54,050 --> 00:10:01,910
and growing largest and fastest growing

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,980
categories in the tech industry so as we

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,230
just mentioned it's a recap as we just

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,290
mentioned the consequences of having a

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:13,000
lack of diversity equity inclusion first

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:16,880
stem from like your products suffer from

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,180
having a focus on this right so those

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,820
lived experiences imagine having a

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,390
person of color maybe a person of my

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,770
skin tone working on that team that was

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,350
creating the sync sensor I'm probably

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,520
going to test it on myself right or I'm

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,810
going to raise that you know if if I'm

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,970
not on that team I'm going to say like

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,490
hey like maybe we should be more

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:44,060
inclusive of how this can work in

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,620
shadows and dark environments or in the

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,100
legs so your products suffer from

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:52,310
equality right second there's a lot of

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,040
missed opportunities to meet to reach

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,950
target audiences right so this is a

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,810
financial incentive as well and third it

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,870
contributes to a growing income

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:05,450
inequality gap as I'm sure you all know

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,520
the tech industry has higher paying jobs

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,780
we have so many more jobs that are

00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,710
available how can

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:15,410
we work together to be able to address

00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,550
the inequality gap so this is the main

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,290
question that we're trying to answer

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,920
here so how can we make the tech

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:24,520
industry more equitable diverse and

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:28,640
inclusive so in three simple words

00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:32,180
access skills and opportunities and I'll

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,150
break these down and three pretty take

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:38,240
easily digestible waste so first we need

00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:42,500
to find ways to diversify the check

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,690
pipeline so how by raise of hands how

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,570
many of you knew in high school that you

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:51,140
wanted to enter some type of career in

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:52,760
tech or you had some aspiration right or

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,460
even if it's not in high school just

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,950
like you know early early 20s or

00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,310
whatever it is right so lots of folks in

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,260
here research actually shows that when

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,810
you're in high school or when you're in

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,500
your tweens that's when you're really

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,660
deciding if you would like to be in tech

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,530
and so when we look at the landscape in

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,740
the u.s. less than 50% of our schools

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:22,750
our high schools have computer science

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:25,970
offerings and so at Ko nation we work

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,940
with under-resourced high schools

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,620
because it's not just 50% right of

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,870
that's 50% of all schools

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,210
under-resourced schools it's even less

00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,800
than that so we work specifically in

00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,590
under-resourced high schools to be able

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,270
to provide more careers for our students

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:47,180
so how are we how our approach works we

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,310
start in around 10th or 11th grade we

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,820
have different schools all across the

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,750
city from Harlem to bed-stuy and also in

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,580
the Bay Area in Chicago and we teach our

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,680
courses taught by volunteers that work

00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,610
at all these different tech companies

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,980
just like yourselves they teach HTML CSS

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,020
and JavaScript and then once students

00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,970
want to move on to the next level we

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,650
have a fellowship a one to two year

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,140
fellowship that takes place at a tech

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,560
company so we've been with Salesforce

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,180
we've been with Google SeatGeek a lot of

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,900
really cool companies and this is where

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,790
students can kind of take that next step

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,950
and really see themselves at a tech

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,050
company and they're doing this you know

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,210
11th grade 12th grade which is amazing

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,040
and then once our students graduate they

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,660
enter our alumni program and we support

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:39,120
them and that as well so our students

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:42,240
reflect what we are trying to push

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,330
towards in the computing workforce 45%

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,900
of our students identify as female and

00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,250
black 80% of our black are black in

00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,760
Latin next and they're coming from

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,530
households that are on average about

00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,040
43,000 the family of four and so if we

00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:01,980
look at the computing workforce it

00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:06,900
obviously is a problem that we're hoping

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,490
to soft through our work we also have

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,680
other programs that are doing really

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,650
great work to diversify the industry and

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,660
this is a Marcy Lab School this is a

00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:18,270
school that just opened up in Brooklyn

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,130
they focus on 18 to 24 year olds and

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:23,280
Grace Hopper how many guys familiar with

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:25,110
Grace Hopper yes Grace Hopper is amazing

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,670
and they're trying to get more women in

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:32,340
tech so to educate the general public so

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:34,560
74% of our students that have finished

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,300
our program are pursuing computer

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,210
programming in one way or another

00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,010
whether that be through school or

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,910
through a job and that's amazing that's

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:48,570
awesome the other 26% is still really

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:51,840
important to this conversation so when

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:54,600
we are addressed with like the issues of

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,820
this world and how tech is now affecting

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,130
all of our lives and how we are more

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,050
reliant on tech more than ever it's

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,750
really important and important to have

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,730
an informed society and having an

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,780
informed society allows for us to be

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:14,360
able to call out things that are making

00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:18,030
our inequities grow more right and so

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,190
another point here is recognizing that

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,590
all of our industries are really

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,420
becoming tech industries and so it's

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,160
becoming more and more prevalent and so

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,420
it's important to have an informed

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,690
society and method three is do your part

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,819
I have a few reasons I have a few ways

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,470
for you to be

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:41,600
to reflect on this so personally right

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,039
go home today think about how you can

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,749
volunteer there's a lot of really great

00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,309
organizations that are doing this work

00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:49,609
if you have the time if you have the

00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:51,019
resources there I'm gonna actually be

00:15:49,609 --> 00:15:53,569
right here I can talk to you more about

00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:56,619
how to get involved with organizations

00:15:53,569 --> 00:16:00,229
like Co nation I would also recommend

00:15:56,619 --> 00:16:03,160
recommending this program Co Nation or

00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:05,809
others that can help teach young people

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,639
how to code so if you have a nephew if

00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:09,379
you have a daughter that might be

00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,029
interested in coding or maybe they don't

00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:12,649
even know what it is this is a really

00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,239
cool this is a really great time for

00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,979
them to learn this because our schools

00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:18,979
don't have this this is a really

00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:21,739
important aspect and the third if you're

00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:23,569
if you have a friend who's looking for a

00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:25,009
career change there are a lot of

00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:27,939
different avenues for you to be able to

00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:29,959
obtain coding skills write

00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:32,989
professionally so this is like in the

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,399
workforce and in the workplace so we

00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:36,649
want to advocate for recruitment

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:42,470
strategies that foster a more diverse

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:45,739
workforce and diverse talent and so that

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,329
can happen in lots of different ways too

00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:51,279
you want to be mindful of how your work

00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:53,589
impacts marginalized people and three

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,059
support a workplace environment that

00:16:53,589 --> 00:17:00,350
really values the experiences of all

00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:02,029
people so those are some tangible things

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,909
I know that was only about 10 minutes or

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:06,500
so but we want this conversation to keep

00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:09,949
on going we want these conversations to

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,259
be at the forefront of what happens the

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:15,409
rest of this conference and in your

00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:18,909
careers so thank you again Suzanne for

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,909
having me really appreciate it

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,500
Thank You Andrew that was awesome so now

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,780
we can open up for questions or if you

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,090
have a discussion topic that you want to

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:36,590
throw out please do I'll start with the

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,300
first question um do you have a

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,120
recommendation for someone who maybe

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,830
wants to be an ally and doesn't know

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,380
where to start like where would someone

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,130
with privilege lend their privilege most

00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,900
effectively sure excellent question

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:53,150
so there are ways I guess there are

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,740
levels to like how you want to be an

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:57,370
ally you could be an ally by

00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,270
volunteering and we have different

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,940
opportunities different ways to get

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,920
involved at an organization like Co

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,980
nation you can sponsor a field trip for

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,560
students you could attend our hackathon

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,620
that happens in March but also I would

00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,270
encourage all of you to read read up on

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,610
there a lot of resources out there a lot

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,400
of things that I can probably share with

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,680
you offline that would be a really good

00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,860
way for you to found like you found

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,940
yourself in and what diversity equity

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,940
inclusion actually leads

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,650
oh great thank you so much for your time

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:47,880
really appreciate it

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:49,140
okay so thanks so much I really liked

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,610
your presentation now it's just curious

00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,230
if you're going to more depth on some of

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:56,400
the stuff you do with alumni because

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:59,160
that's often an area of key value that I

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,360
know is able to provide a real benefit

00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,100
so you could speak to that more I'd be

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,960
really interested in learning yeah so

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,940
thank you for your question

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,890
so in their fellowship class which is

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:12,030
the class that takes place at the tech

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,830
company they are not only learning more

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,720
advanced JavaScript and api's and all

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:17,160
those technical skills they're also

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,590
learning those professional skills that

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,000
will carry them on so we help them by

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,600
you know setting up their LinkedIn

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
accounts and once they're an alum we

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,500
have different conferences I think we

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,120
may even have a few students I just

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,550
checked my slack before I got up here a

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,130
student is anyone a student of code

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,890
nation or former student in here no okay

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:40,470
maybe they're just stuck out there but

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,290
we always engage we engage our students

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,830
and the other day actually we had a

00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,480
student who graduated from the program

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,540
several years ago and now graduated

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,200
college in her first year in code nation

00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:58,080
she used her her volunteers as

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,340
references for a job at Google and she

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,740
just got that job in in San Francisco so

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,660
having this network having this

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,580
community and and staying connected to

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,810
our students beyond graduation is what

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,490
we're trying to do because ultimately

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,010
we're trying to prepare students for

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:18,570
careers in tech not just to learn how to

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:20,760
code hi thank you so much for your

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,870
presentation it was really great thank

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:26,940
you um I'm on the data science side and

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:30,840
one of the observations I've had in

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:35,280
hiring meaning from an employer trying

00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:38,490
to recruit perspective is that so many

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,720
times the resumes that come back from HR

00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:45,270
are really not diverse at all and I'm

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,830
not I'm not even getting the resumes

00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:51,200
that I would love to consider and I find

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,529
that

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,200
part of the problem right now is the

00:20:54,529 --> 00:21:01,519
lack of I guess role models in data

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,880
science who are diverse so I think that

00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:07,220
a lot of organizations like yours are

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,320
trying to tackle the problem from of

00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:15,620
course the younger generation but do you

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,309
have any thoughts as to right now how

00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,710
can we get more diversity among people

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,750
who are a little bit more senior like

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,149
myself or just a bit below in

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:30,500
recruitment sure thank you so much for

00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:32,929
your question so I had the volunteer

00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,360
community lead so I actually do a lot of

00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:37,100
recruiting myself and so I go to a lot

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,940
of different tech companies and see what

00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:44,870
they do successfully have you've heard

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:48,789
of an employment resource group it's a

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:52,750
ERG these are these groups that are

00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:55,340
intended to provide spaces for

00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,309
minorities for women at that

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,620
organization at Salesforce they have

00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:02,750
what's known as though like an Ohana

00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,360
group and so there's there's like a

00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,659
black Ohana group there is a Latin X

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,080
Ohana group there is a LGBTQ Ohana group

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:15,980
and having these lake communities at

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:19,159
this organization allows it it enables

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,059
that trust for the folks that are there

00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:26,240
to be able to really branch out and

00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:29,330
bring on more of people within their

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,700
community I think it it's it's also a

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,200
way from like the outside it shows that

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,110
maybe there are data scientists out

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,870
there that want to work at your company

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:40,100
but they don't feel like there is the

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,350
company is doing enough to actually

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,100
support them and so having those ERG

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:48,860
groups and and providing that space for

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,269
them isn't incentive for a lot of folks

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,750
of color who might be interested in

00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:55,010
applying so I would start thinking about

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,309
what that might look like for your

00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:01,760
organization there are a lot of really

00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:04,279
great tech meetups all across are you

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,090
from New York or yeah there's always a

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,760
lot of tech meet

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:12,050
like all across the city that you know

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,200
are really made for these types of

00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,030
opportunities exchanging contacts and

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,970
networking it takes and it takes a

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:25,490
village right but I would think about

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:26,840
those two things yeah yeah thank you and

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:36,580
just before oh did you have a question

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:39,710
yeah hi my name is Amanda Crawford and

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,380
one of the questions that I have is how

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,560
do you keep the students engaged so yeah

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,600
I've come across students who just may

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,120
be good at something but the content or

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,540
the way that it's taught may not really

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,770
be interesting enough to continue so

00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,740
yeah what are some of the things that

00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,690
you've seen or code nation have seen to

00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:03,740
keep you know the students interested in

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:05,840
and to pursue more complex material sure

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,430
thank you so much mana for your question

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,440
I think so the courses are taught by

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,420
four volunteers using their own teams of

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,490
four usually have a lead teacher we have

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,460
like three support volunteers the

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:22,430
courses also has a program manager like

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,290
myself who are former teachers and so we

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:27,470
can provide those coaching skills to be

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:29,080
able to allow for the volunteer to be

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:33,470
able to teach any more engaging way

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:36,110
we're also there just as our classes are

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,120
fun I'll put it I'll just say that I

00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,980
mean we do have fun in the class our

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:44,480
curriculum has been developed over time

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:47,930
by not only our staff but developers and

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,910
our students so each year it gets better

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,670
it's probably that the best it's ever

00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,810
been at this point but um yeah there are

00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:56,030
different ways of doing it different

00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:59,750
teaching strategies that we enable it's

00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:02,410
all in our pedagogy and yeah thank you

00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,410
thank you

00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:13,850
so di work often falls on minorities to

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:16,400
actually do the vast majority of it so

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,770
how do those of us with like the most

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,230
privileged as a white straight male

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:22,929
how do I support di efforts more

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,300
effectively without mm-hmm

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:30,050
like it's it's a fraught space right I

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,580
can't I can't communicate often in ways

00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,320
or I don't understand the experience of

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,840
someone but I want to help in a way so

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,500
how can I best thank you do that and how

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,660
can we help other people do that as well

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,510
thank you so much for that is really

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:48,140
important I think there are levels to

00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:50,420
how to get involved mm-hmm I think the

00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,280
philosophy of stepping up and stepping

00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,140
back is really important in this

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,460
conversation there are there going to be

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:02,090
moments where you may need to be a voice

00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,570
to have something change right but

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:10,040
that's also recognizing like that if

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:12,140
it's not your moment to be at the

00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,570
forefront then I think that's something

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,410
that is like by a case-by-case but as an

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:19,880
ally you can do that on a day to day

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,130
there are things within your control

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:27,710
that you can do to be able to allow for

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:29,510
that and it's it's tough because it's

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:32,240
also like trying to understand like when

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:37,670
is the right time to step up right and

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,450
when to step back I guess it's more of a

00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,120
conversation

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,730
we can always talk like offline but that

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,710
also has to see like what is really

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,020
happening at your organization and what

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,520
types of things are you trying to

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,130
highlight but I would just encourage the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,190
philosophy of when it's time to step up

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:57,800
to step up not just just like dive in

00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,650
but but sometimes it's like important

00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,809
just to like show that you are there and

00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:10,910
be supportive and in other ways that are

00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:13,610
within your control and just to add to

00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:17,030
that the bingo card has some really

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:19,700
great ideas too and then so any more

00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,410
questions this has been really great and

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,140
I'll just before we get back to our

00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,510
individual conversations I wanted to let

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:28,820
everyone know that gateway school for

00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:31,400
technology is out in the expo hall they

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,150
are helping students from difficult

00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,770
backgrounds

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,800
find technology here they are right here

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,330
so calm talk to them if you also want to

00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,310
learn more and go visit them in the expo

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,960
hall too so that's great and Andrew

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,250
thank you again so much thank you so

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,880
much of the work that you and cognition

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,609
are doing really ready

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,609
