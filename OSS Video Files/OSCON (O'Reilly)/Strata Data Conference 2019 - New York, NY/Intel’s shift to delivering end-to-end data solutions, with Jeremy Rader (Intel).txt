hi Roger McGough is here with Jeremy

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,569
Rader a senior director of data centric

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,210
solutions I've Intel welcome thank you

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,980
and let's start let's tell something

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,110
about your data related background and

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,309
challenges that Intel yeah yeah so I've

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,160
been at Intel for quite a while about

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,730
little over 22 years a big chunk of that

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,199
was in the Intel IT organization and

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,510
inside of that role we were focusing a

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,310
lot on how we could restructure at the

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,680
time business intelligence and advanced

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,539
analytics to get more value for our

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,730
customers which were at this case our

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,610
internal partners and business groups

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,320
and so you know doing that it's a big

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,510
shift for the company trying to move

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,520
from you know kind of more of that at

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,469
tail end of the conversation for

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,809
analytics to make that the the forefront

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,010
of the dialogue so it you know that

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,989
takes a long time when it's a hundred

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,760
thousand person company but ultimately

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:52,860
you know really shaping that through the

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,920
types of things we were delivering we

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,530
were able to kind of retune the company

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,210
yeah so you've been doing this a long

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,680
while you've probably been able to

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,359
identify some trends and the kind of

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,320
data and any eyespace but yeah what do

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,060
you think you want to share

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,430
yeah well it's a pretty dynamic space

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,500
and you know what we see a lot happening

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,409
out there right now would be in memory

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,540
analytics fast paced delivery of

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,770
solutions and so we're watching that

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,439
very closely and we have some

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,200
technologies that are helping to really

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,479
drive more in memory capability in the

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,280
ecosystem I also think that

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,950
containerization and portability are

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,810
becoming a really important trend people

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,450
don't want to get locked into any one

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,979
architecture or one technology they want

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,869
to be able to develop something and move

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,759
it from place to place depending on what

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,110
is most important for them at that time

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,549
so I think that multi-cloud portability

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,890
containerization strategy is a really

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,149
important trend for us to watch and

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,530
something that we we're definitely are

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,990
looking at how we can shape that again

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,210
with our technologies I'd say the last

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,060
one is is this kind of merging of

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,909
different things HPC and AI or big data

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,020
and a

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,729
or your ERP and AI you know it's really

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,549
starting to bring all these advanced

00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,250
capabilities more integrated into the

00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,580
things that we've been doing for decades

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,980
all right

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,930
given the kind of ubiquity now of data

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,610
in AI in places including what you've

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,650
seen in your own company

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,660
how is Intel helping people overcome

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,390
some of the challenges that they're

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,970
facing so we've been on this shift from

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,040
this PC centric company to a data

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,590
centric company and what that really

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,200
means at least in my words is thinking

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,910
about that end-to-end data journey you

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,650
know everything from how you ingest from

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,140
the edge all the way through to how you

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,810
you deliver that to a customer and

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:43,420
ultimately even archive that data so all

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,670
of our technologies have that kind of

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,160
view in mind as we deliver new

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:50,890
capabilities entirely new technologies

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,349
like persistent memory and even the

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,690
software stack that that we focus on so

00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:59,260
we have about 15,000 software engineers

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,360
that are focused on optimizing at the OS

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,940
level all the way to application and

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,709
kind of everything in between

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,209
so in this way your role is helping them

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,030
the kind of server side how else is

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,579
Intel helping folks deal with analytics

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,700
and data yeah so you know it's a again

00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,859
it's a complex area and if you don't

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,840
know how to get started in this space or

00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,190
you're struggling to get started one

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,540
thing that we do is we try and pull

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,250
these different capabilities this

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,280
different portfolio that intel has

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,290
together into more of an end-to-end

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,209
architecture that somebody could

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,430
actually pick up and leverage and get

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,079
the kind of value expectations out of it

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,209
that we've already tested and we've

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,459
already evaluated with our partners and

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,100
so a big part of what we're trying to do

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,530
is that easy button right how can we

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,450
help somebody more readily go from I

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,060
need something to I've actually put it

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:53,470
into production and I'm using it great

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,030
the you've been in a while events you

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,569
know where you get a lot of information

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,519
from it

00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,109
is there kind of like one kind of key

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,450
message or insight you'd really like to

00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,410
communicate to the kind of audience is

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,010
interested in yeah

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:09,370
yeah absolutely you know it's a Intel's

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,840
been around a long time obviously and we

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,150
are going through this transition to

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,470
data-centric that said I think there's

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,930
still a lot of people that think of us

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,670
as the silicon guys right you provide

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,110
the silicon that goes into the hardware

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,020
and that's kind of where it stops I

00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,540
think the big message is we have this

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,480
army of resources out there working with

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,370
the ecosystem partners to optimize the

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,460
best of those new software technologies

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,870
with our hardware portfolio and really

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,180
bring that together in a way where we

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,430
can get the most new innovation the most

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,950
value into the ability to move more and

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,600
process and store more data and so I

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,730
think that that message of think of

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,100
Intel beyond that just silicon provider

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,740
and realize that we're on this journey

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,120
too we're going through it internally we

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,620
understand what our customers are going

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,110
through and it's a good chance to

00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,660
leverage a bit more of the of the Intel

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,310
position in helping to evaluate how we

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,590
could overcome some of the challenges in

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,570
this space is there a kind of a cultural

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,980
challenge that you see coming out of

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,320
this I mean we talk about a lot of

00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,060
technical things but you know you've had

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,400
your own challenge as a company and I'm

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,100
sure your people you talk to absolutely

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,750
yeah actually technology is the tail end

00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,030
of this conversation it's really about

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,070
understanding your business partners

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,390
knowing what those key priorities are

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,460
the biggest problems that they're trying

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,890
to solve kind of earning a seat at the

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,570
table so that you can help them connect

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,180
the dots back to the analytics in the AI

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,310
you know at this point you can't just

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,840
show up with great new solutions they

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,120
need to know that you're you're in it

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,500
with them and really prioritizing those

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,470
key things that are going to help them

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,450
accelerate in their domains so I would

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,910
say that that trend or that that

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,590
capability of no the business the

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,660
technology is great you got to have that

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,669
too but it's really about you know using

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,220
that as a part of this bigger story

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,280
great well thanks for your time thank

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,280
you

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,400
