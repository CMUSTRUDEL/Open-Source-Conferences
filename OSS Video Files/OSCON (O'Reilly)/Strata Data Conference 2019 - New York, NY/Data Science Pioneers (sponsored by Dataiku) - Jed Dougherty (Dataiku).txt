Title: Data Science Pioneers (sponsored by Dataiku) - Jed Dougherty (Dataiku)
Publication date: 2019-09-26
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Jed Dougherty presents the trailer of the upcoming Data Science Pioneers documentary about the passionate data scientists driving us toward technological revolution.

Cut through the hype with Data Science Pioneers and see what it really means to be a data scientist. Even though the name is new, the role has a long lineage in statistics and information sciences. And while the challenges data scientists now face occur on an unprecedented scale, they stand on the shoulders of technical and ethical quandaries that came before.

Real data scientists contextualize the role and why they love it, while exploring the concerns and challenges to come.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,640
data science is the sexiest job of the

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:09,719
21st century how many of us are tired of

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,360
hearing that I'm not I love it I love

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,799
the job security it gives me let the

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,390
boost of ego gives me every morning when

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:21,300
I wake up feels really nice but what

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,439
does it mean to be a data scientist we

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,840
have a lot of different roles at a lot

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,369
of different companies people at Google

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,769
are building the new algorithms the rest

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,009
of us use every day some of us are just

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,090
typing something into scikit-learn in

00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,579
hitting run on our jupiter notebooks

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,329
some of us might be deploying kubernetes

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,040
clusters using AWS the wide variety of

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,760
data science jobs in America and across

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,300
the world is why we decided to put

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,410
together data science pioneers this is

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,449
documentary the data iku decided to

00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,520
begin constructing more than a year ago

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,410
to investigate the different types of

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,930
data science jobs across America in the

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,500
world and how data scientists are making

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,950
an effect everywhere so that further ado

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,950
I'm going to fire off this trailer I

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,630
want to use my artificial intelligence

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,750
to help humans live a better life data

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,549
science is truly revolutionising the

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,710
world

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,390
every engineer will have some exposure

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,070
to data science and therefore every

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,689
consumer in the world will be

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,119
interacting with something that is to do

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,340
with machine learning the potential to

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,560
unlock so much information to unlock so

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,140
many new ways of exploring our world and

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,969
doing better for our world there's been

00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,219
a lot of issues where data science goes

00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:42,380
wrong Facebook is a great example

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:45,170
the Cambridge analytical stuff we have

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,810
revolutionized digital marketing but

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,280
what did the consumer get from that you

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,959
sort of only see the news that your

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,789
friends and the people that you talk to

00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,130
a lot are interested in everyone just

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,780
gets exactly their own echo chamber and

00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,369
those echo chambers just get smarter and

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,680
smarter and they just keep serving us

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,240
the same information

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,850
what are the blind spots what are the

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,530
big areas that we don't know that's our

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,739
role as data scientist to us as

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,470
questions we had just started scratching

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,450
the surface of AI people will realize

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,150
that a lot of what has been comest is

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,700
not yet possible computers have a hard

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,019
time reasoning about the events they

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,530
have a hard time telling what will

00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:24,150
happen

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,670
if something would have been different

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:31,680
if you're driving towards a cliff you

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,549
know if you drive over it you're going

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,440
to fall and AI doesn't know that it

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,630
actually has to experience falling off

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,250
this cliff

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,829
whoever gets ahead in this race we

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,120
definitely make better decisions and

00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,769
whomever can make better decision we

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720
obviously when there's 50 million

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:50,430
dollars to fight you gotta make sure to

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,160
take the right decision at the right

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,310
time and last we have Big Data era

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,610
social science finally found its

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,299
telescope we're suddenly able to look

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:05,700
across huge geographical widths huge

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,920
depths of time this is really what makes

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,450
a huge impact on our business and will

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,920
stare all along but we couldn't see it

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,900
we no longer have to rely on our

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,730
personal experience we can collect that

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,730
collectively what are the frontiers

00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:29,920
thank you very much to continue the

00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:32,570
conversation clap please clap Jeb Bush

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,459
to continue the conversation you can

00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:36,530
come by our booth 1 1 3 5 or right in

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,090
the middle or you can log on to data

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,800
science top movie to the schedule

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,750
private screening or find out where one

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,930
is coming to your area thank you very

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,930
much

00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,330
