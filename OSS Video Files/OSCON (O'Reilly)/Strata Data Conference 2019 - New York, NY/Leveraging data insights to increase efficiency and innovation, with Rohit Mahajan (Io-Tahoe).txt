hi Roger McGough is VP of radar O'Reilly

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:08,820
here at Strava 2019 in New York and I'm

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,340
here with Rohit Mahajan who is the

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,980
co-founder chief technology and product

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,719
officer at i/o Tahoe welcome thank you

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,150
so much are you excited to be here and

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,010
looking forward great so organizations

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,529
now have more access to data than ever

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,570
and they're trying to use this to get

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,310
efficiency and insights and so forth

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,710
how can technology help them move

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,269
forward in that direction so what I

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,880
generally say Roger is data is the new

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,770
currency it is actually a double-edged

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,840
sword if you would it cannot

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,020
if managed properly if the bright

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,850
insights are delivered from from the

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,920
data it can get you to increase the

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,590
revenue have the regulatory compliance

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,020
have the right governance if not used

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,360
properly or the right measures are not

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,829
put around the data set then obviously

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,140
you could have regulatory issues and

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,520
challenges so organizations what they're

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,039
doing today is leveraging a lot of

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,719
technology platforms to get to the right

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,420
data governance to get to the right data

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,729
visualization data prep data wrangling

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,280
so on and so forth data integration

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,930
there's bi products out there that are

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,729
getting that are getting to produce that

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,930
value add to the end-user and consumer

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,930
all of these journeys they do start at

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,930
the data discovery you are only gonna

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,390
get as good of the output as good as

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,700
your smart data discoveries and that's

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,369
exactly what we're focusing on IO Tahoe

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,740
is a platform get to the right and what

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,570
do I mean by data discovery it's getting

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,659
to the right data relationships the

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,770
right data flows soft lineage and the

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,560
right data restricted data

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,170
classification the data profiling done

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,420
and data de doop de tur all of these

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,680
data discoveries if done right and

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,899
upfront with high usage of AI ml can

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,250
actually produce fantastic results when

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,530
it comes to the data governance there

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,950
are cataloging or other end-user feature

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,810
sets so the journey must start with the

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,189
right data discovery smartly to

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,729
discovery and that's what exactly we're

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,799
trying to focus on a diode

00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:07,719
so how do you see automation working

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,879
into this process that's actually one of

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,180
my favorite topics right so I use the

00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,360
word frustration by Excel I go around

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,920
I'm very apt that's right I used to I

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,750
used to have it actually test by Excel

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,900
but we have folks sitting around doing

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,980
crowdsourcing running data governance

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,300
knocking the doors of the subject matter

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,519
experts and trying to collect the

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,890
information hey how does this lineage

00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:31,660
flow how does the how this is this a

00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,989
sensitive field it's just a sensitive

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,349
column do we have exposure and so on how

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:41,290
do we do analytics all of that needs to

00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:42,910
be removed if not all at least most of

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,340
it needs to be removed we are living in

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,579
a day and age of automation we're

00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,790
talking about AI ml we are talking about

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:53,440
ml model AI model actually perfecting

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,160
chess in less than four hours

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,459
right so automation is the key faster

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,220
time to value the accuracy the

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,549
efficiency automation is the only way to

00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,160
get to it and leveraging AI ml the right

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,910
models is is the fastest way to get to

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,760
it so that brings up with AI so much in

00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,639
the air AI n ml there's this kind of

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,730
notion of weird does the human and what

00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:23,100
is the automation begin and what is your

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,030
opinion on unwary

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:31,030
human versus machine so I personally

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,980
really strongly believe in between AI

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,989
artificial intelligence and human

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,940
intelligence there's a right to Malcolm

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,819
ation that has to happen and that's

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:42,310
exactly what we are doing so what we say

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:45,310
is let's start the journey with the

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:47,019
right AI model which does the right

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,299
prediction of the relationship the right

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,910
prediction of discovery with the right

00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:54,459
confidence the highest true positive and

00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,980
the lowest false positives that's what

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,630
the Machine does and gets you to 80%

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,669
mark guess what

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,880
that's where human intelligence has to

00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,829
come in to actually accept or reject the

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,840
prediction that machine has done so

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:09,150
without the right amalgamation right

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,430
interaction

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,659
AI is not going to go too far and humans

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,380
are obviously going to be restricted

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:16,239
without

00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,790
using the automation of ML and the

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,130
prediction so how far do you see this

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:24,310
going in terms of our business strategy

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,600
and fit with companies you know a lot of

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,750
people are looking at it but I think

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
it's uncertain what's gonna happen yeah

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,820
so it's actually it all starts with

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,040
understanding the use case and the

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,650
problem that's getting solved and again

00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:42,040
I'll go back to what our anchor is what

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,530
our vision is discover your data set

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,380
it could be structured semi-structured

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,690
unstructured IOT data if you know your

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,060
data it's like knowing your plumbing if

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,580
you know it then you can have the best

00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,940
analytics the best visualization and so

00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,920
on now bringing in the AI ml and that's

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,140
again as I mentioned earlier that's what

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,440
we do at Tahoe we have nine patents on

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,840
AI ml filed pending approval that's what

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,690
we do every single day every line of

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,510
code that we write is focused on how can

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,880
we get to the automation how can we do

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,190
the right modeling which is domain

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,120
agnostic does not break from a client to

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:26,080
client and on top of that just the right

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,900
prediction at certain point we bring the

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,720
users in and the users can provide the

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,430
feedback at that point we again bring

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,610
the AI to do the reinforcement learning

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,670
and so this is a continuous I call it

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,700
propulsion upwards between a human a I

00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,250
let me help you as AI that AI helped me

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,350
to give results to each other can have

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,660
the proper valuation between the two and

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,040
key propelling forward data as I

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,920
mentioned earlier there as the currency

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,710
if you use it right it is getting us to

00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,420
places I see clients actually leveraging

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:03,370
data to get to new new heights and so on

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,470
using it the right way discovering it

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,510
the right way is where the journey

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,040
starts if you discover it right you can

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:13,680
really catapult really fast and and

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,720
really fast to the to D to the endgame

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,150
what would you tell an organization you

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,470
know how best to accommodate this

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,900
they're kind of culturally and

00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,510
structurally

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,950
that's to be honest that's one of the

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,540
bigger challenges it's not the

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,270
technology cultural challenge is the

00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,040
bigger challenge so essentially what my

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,900
recommendation to the organisations is

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,900
which is which is what I end up talking

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,510
to the clients make sure that the right

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,930
program is set up make sure that the

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,510
users know what your use case is what

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,150
you're trying to achieve you cannot get

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:51,450
to it overnight and one platform is not

00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,210
gonna solve it all for you but make sure

00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,610
again when you start the journey start

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,320
with the right discovery it's same as

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,570
you've given the input as gold or

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,510
diamond the output will be equivalent if

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:06,540
you give it unknown relations unknown

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,360
there are attribution it's not gonna go

00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:12,450
too far so it all starts with the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,250
discovery set up the program right have

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,500
the users engaged give them the right

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,050
automation tool sets get it exciting for

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,440
them I'd game if I it give them the

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:27,270
right collaborative environment to work

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,550
in leveraging AI it's very attractive to

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,070
each one of us out there at the client

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,410
site or not a client site to actually

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,110
talk about AI and when users start

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,210
seeing the prediction everybody wants to

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,090
get off that frustration by Excel and

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:44,190
once they see that once they see that AI

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,760
is producing the right prediction of

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:49,620
relationships it's a self dap tation of

00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,870
the process you don't have to push them

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,640
and they will do it themselves great

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,380
well thanks a lot for your time thank

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,380
you so much ru thanks for having me

00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,220
