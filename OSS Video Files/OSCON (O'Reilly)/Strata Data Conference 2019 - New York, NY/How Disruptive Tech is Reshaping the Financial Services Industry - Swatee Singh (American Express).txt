The financial services industry is increasingly using disruptive technology—including AI and machine learning, edge computing, blockchain, mobile and mixed reality, virtual assistants, and quantum computing to name a few—to enhance the customer experience and personalize their interactions with customers. The same is true at American Express. 

Swatee Singh examines broad trends in financial services with respect to leveraging disruptive technologies. She also highlights specific examples of how American Express uses these technologies; for example, using mixed reality to enhance the customer experience, personalizing customer service interactions through AI and ML, and employing Alexa integrations to streamline purchasing journeys.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,700
artificial intelligence blockchain edge

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,589
computing Virtual Assistants

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,599
you've been hearing all about these

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,210
things in the last hour or a couple of

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,509
hours and you might feel as if changes

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,500
in the air and that is certainly true

00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,920
but I thought I would give you some

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,750
perspective who here in the audience

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,779
remembers owning that green metal tab on

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,160
the far right in the top row I'm so

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,260
happy that no one raised their hands

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,359
because that is from the early 1900s

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,369
when department stores would give these

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,040
out to customers so that they could

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,280
track credit their names and the actual

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,170
credit amount was written in ink and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,570
since then this industry has seen many

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,329
many disruptions both in terms of how

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,460
credit risk loans are underwritten the

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,200
business processes even down to the form

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,649
factor of the credit cards that are

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,210
issued that lowly ATM sandwiched between

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,160
two New York City buildings that you see

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,340
up there may not look like much to you

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,070
today but it was a huge disrupter back

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,830
in 1967 when Barclays first installed it

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,270
in one of its banks in London and what

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,090
it did was forever changed the

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,909
relationship of a bank to its customer

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,080
and it changed it because no more was it

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,990
face to face

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,119
intimate and frequent but rather it

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,250
became there became a layer of

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,970
technology between that relationship of

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:28,110
those two entities today the cellphone

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:30,210
is much like that ATM of 1967 where it's

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,710
disrupting how we communicate with the

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,780
financial institutions we have a

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,950
relationship with and how those

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,600
institutions communicate back with us

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,820
the point of this slide really is not so

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,530
much to say that hey disruptions always

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,020
been there in this industry but really

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,820
to say what's different now and why we

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,399
feel there is this change in the air

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,979
is because it's the pace of disruption

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,350
which has changed dramatically and what

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,310
is adding to that feeling of changes

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,420
also the rise of the fintechs itself I

00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,610
thought I would talk a little bit about

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,740
how that how those fintechs have come

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,750
about in an industry which has been very

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,810
difficult to break into until the very

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,080
recent past obviously it is assisted by

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,840
the rise of disruptive tech and what it

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,340
does is

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,330
I'm going to use specifically machine

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,269
learning and artificial intelligence

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,300
here as an example and then the reason

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,640
why this is important here is because

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,440
these companies can now meet the unmet

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
needs of the customer

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,580
by using these disruptive tech and

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,739
what's interesting is to see how cloud

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,110
providers some of whom you've heard in

00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:38,230
the last hour or so have really lowered

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,660
the bar for admittance and usage of this

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,650
disruptive tech by commoditizing machine

00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,370
learning and artificial intelligence

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,620
that combined with open banking open

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,750
banking is a finance technology term it

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,090
really means use of open source

00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:55,000
technology to build api's that

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,470
third-party developers can then use may

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,480
not sound like much but this is like

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,540
creating the iOS on top of which other

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,120
apps are built for banks and that

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,459
combine lastly with a major global trend

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,879
which is global spend moving from the

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,799
physical this is cash to the virtual

00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,170
this is through digital payments these

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,750
three things together have for this

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,780
particular industry really changed the

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,639
paradigm for financial startups FinTech

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,410
to really come up and now what you also

00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,569
notice is a lot of financial

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,549
institutions the established ones are

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,920
beginning to form deep relationships

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,160
with these very fintechs nearly 80% of

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,989
them now have these relationships what

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,670
is interesting for me as an observer and

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:40,599
as a participant in this industry is

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:43,120
that 70% of leaders in financial

00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:45,519
services when they are polled about

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,260
disruptive tech they say it is a concern

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,650
for them and that is because

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,510
traditionally this industry has adopted

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,430
technology which is very mature but now

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,739
they're they're adopting technologies

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,109
which they still consider perhaps in

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,599
their maturity cycle relatively early on

00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:03,730
and you might wonder what why are they

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,560
adopting it why are they racing to outdo

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,290
each other when adopting these

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,260
technologies and that's really because

00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:13,030
of you the customer customers are

00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:17,769
increasingly looking for personalization

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:20,500
in real time 75% of you when polled say

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,050
that your loyalty to a brand that is

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,930
able to raise the bar for expect a bar

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,840
for experiences and is able to do so in

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,170
real time

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,780
we'll win your loyalty and that when you

00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,330
couple it with things like 54% of you

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,490
also say that your trust in financial

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,340
institutions it's hard for these

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,440
institutions to get your trust and and

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,630
think about how companies can react to

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,820
some asked like this from customers

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,010
which is hey I want personalization I

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,230
want you to do things that are uniquely

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,840
for me and I want you to understand me

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,850
and solve my problems I want you to do

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,850
this in real time and then how exactly

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,290
will companies do this well let me give

00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,510
you an example things like edge

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,190
computing today financial service

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,710
companies are looking at edge compute

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,540
not because they are very savvy in the

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,150
use of edge compute but because that is

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,830
how they deliver that trust as in the

00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,260
deliver the privacy which builds the

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,669
trust and this is how they actually are

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,010
able to build and deliver that

00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,340
personalization which is contextual and

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,250
it's real-time

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:28,210
so how has American Express tried to

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,580
really use these technologies in its own

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:33,530
premises before I do that let me kind of

00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,520
give you a sense of what an average Amex

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:40,669
customer looks like today 70% of all new

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,380
customers that we onboard they will be

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,729
digitally engaged from the first month

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,470
of onboarding of the active accounts 78%

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,470
will continue to be digitally active

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,310
throughout their lifecycle what this has

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:57,080
meant for us is that we have to really

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,610
reassure knee would look like when

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,919
they're engaging with us on this digital

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,550
channel and obviously we are moving away

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:07,400
from hey how do I get you your payments

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,340
through - how do I actually help you in

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,250
other aspects of your life so today if

00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,710
you are trying to plan a vacation well

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,200
you can use meze to actually plan your

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,300
vacation and then once you are on your

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,340
vacation and you're at the airport you

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,110
can use lounge buddy to figure out which

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,300
lounges have less traffic and where

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,400
should you go and chill before you

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,350
actually head out for your vacation

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,930
let's say you're on that vacation we

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,880
send you contextual information to help

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,890
you enjoy your vacation better but then

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,740
you want to find restaurants that are

00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,180
more suited to your tastes use resi to

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,910
reserve

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,490
tables and restaurants in fact a recent

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,890
acquisition of pocket concierge in Japan

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,630
means that our customers are now able to

00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,060
get into Michelin star equivalent

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:55,330
restaurants within the width of with a

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,300
notice of just a few hours we've also

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,370
used automation with along with machine

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,410
learning to automate hundreds of

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,360
processes in the backend thereby

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,850
changing the experience of our customers

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,640
if you are a customer today in certain

00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,800
parts of the world we verify your ID not

00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,800
manually but using computer vision if

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,720
you are a merchant we service you today

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,030
when you email us with a question or a

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,910
query about your account we don't take

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,950
days it takes us much less because we

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,050
look through the email to figure out the

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,690
intent the nature of the question that

00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,180
has been raised in the email and direct

00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:34,270
it to a service queue automatically if

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,370
you are if you are you know in the

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,290
commercial business we've we've done a

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,900
heavy automation of our accounts payable

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,610
platform such that spending limits are

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,500
updated automatically depending on how

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,290
you're doing and what we anticipate your

00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,780
needs to be this is not reactive but

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:52,810
rather proactive automation and as an

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,680
example that has led to a 43% increase

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,050
in Amex spend of these merchants with us

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,840
with a hundred and ten trillion Amex

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,660
cards in circulation our networks

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:09,360
process about a trillion dollars every

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:13,480
single year and that means that we have

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,340
25% of the US credit card activity share

00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,850
that is part of a that is part of

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,530
American Express so you must have

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,880
definitely gotten the message that I'm

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,210
trying to give here which is we are a

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,930
company that's focused on the digital

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,240
but it's not just limited to you know

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,850
planning your vacation or or beyond that

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,770
it's also a lot about how you talk to us

00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:38,500
what is your dialogue with us and how

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,360
are we servicing you and we do so today

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,340
with a variety of apps you could use

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,560
Alexa you could install a skill in there

00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,070
and talk to us and ask us about benefits

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,790
in your reward program we've partnered

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,770
with fintechs like PayPal venmo and that

00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,050
that allows our customers to do peer

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,690
to peer payments or payments to other

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,279
PayPal merchants not just through the

00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,490
actual use of dollars but even your

00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:05,080
points if that's what you want to do

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,540
we've used blockchain yes we've used

00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,920
blockchain not just for cross-border

00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,470
payments like a lot of other financial

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,850
institutions like some of what the

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,529
previous speakers were talking about

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,680
we've been experimenting and playing and

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,540
thinking about how else can be

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,880
positively changed the user experience

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,680
and the customer experience and recently

00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,200
we announced a partnership with boxed

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,600
and it fundamentally changes how our

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,339
reward programs work that's because if

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,350
you look at traditional credit card

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,839
reward programs they are at a merchant

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,690
level which means we might say things

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,760
like 3% cashback for all spend in

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,589
restaurants but with partnerships like

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,089
the ones that we just talked about with

00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:45,040
boxed which are powered by the

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,920
blockchain it allows us to give you

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,380
reward programs or reward points at a

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,660
product level we're experimenting even

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,550
more in fact we want to think about how

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,380
do we reward our customers not just for

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,180
the transaction which is what's

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:02,500
traditionally done but even for activity

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,930
so everything I've talked about so far

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,880
really is about what's happening today

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,760
in the industry or perhaps in the next

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,920
12 to 24 months where customers are

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,020
looking for and financial institutions

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,959
are looking to give these customers a

00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:19,060
seamless experience that is personal it

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,620
doesn't require effort on the part of

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,750
the customer itself to get what they

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:26,170
need to do and it's all real time it's

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,390
contextual but you may ask well what's

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,420
gonna happen beyond that to your horizon

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,550
and I hesitate because very famous men

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:36,010
and women in their areas of expertise

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,600
have been really wrong about when

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,149
predicting what the future of their

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,250
industry might look like but I can't

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,529
help myself so I will still try to make

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,300
some predictions and I think everything

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,940
we've talked about here is is really

00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,459
cool but if you look at Asia that's

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,459
where I see some real excitement and how

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,600
financial services industries is headed

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,720
specifically I'll sort of call out

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,459
WeChat which is not just what everything

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,400
I've talked about talks about how you go

00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,140
from being a payments provider to more

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,930
relevant in the lives of your customers

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,630
but we chat is

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:13,470
like a combination of a Facebook a

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:17,250
GrubHub a venmo a messenger of whatsapp

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:19,890
and payments all rolled into one app and

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,810
that experience and experience it gives

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,730
to its customers is dramatically

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,490
different than anything we see today in

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,980
the West and and I think that our

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,620
industry and its use of AI will

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,740
increasingly move in that direction but

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,029
really if I think about how financial

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:42,089
services might evolve where we are today

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:44,070
we have to look no further than what you

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,890
the customer is looking for because

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,740
ultimately that is what drives our the

00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:52,260
companies in the space to build

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,790
experiment and solve for so thank you

00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,700
for your time

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,700
