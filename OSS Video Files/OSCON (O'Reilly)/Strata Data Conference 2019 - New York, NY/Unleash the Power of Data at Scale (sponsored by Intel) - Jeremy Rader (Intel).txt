Title: Unleash the Power of Data at Scale (sponsored by Intel) - Jeremy Rader (Intel)
Publication date: 2019-09-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Data analytics is the long-standing but constantly evolving science that companies leverage for insight, innovation, and competitive advantage. AI has emerged as a vital tool for reaching higher maturity and scale of data analytics and accelerating the transformation from traditional “operational analytics” that help you understand what happened and why to “advanced analytics” that help you derive real-time insights and predict and plan for the future. AI has unleashed a new era of creativity and ingenuity, but moving solutions from theory to reality and from the one-size-fits-all lab modules development approach to deploying real-world system solutions that are flexible, scalable, and cost-effective have proven to be complex and full of challenges. 

Jeremy Rader explores Intel’s end-to-end data pipeline software strategy designed and optimized for a modern and flexible data-centric infrastructure that allows for the easy deployment of unified advanced analytics and AI solutions at scale.

	00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,920
you know one of the things that I

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,330
absolutely love about working at Intel

00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:08,849
is ability to talk to so many different

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,099
companies about their analytics journey

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,150
and what they're going through we get to

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,160
hear about the things that they're

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,910
struggling with and also some of the

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,140
wins one company in particular is a

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,210
company that started on this pretty

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,820
significant digital transformation a

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,480
couple of years ago all in an effort to

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,199
simplify application solution and value

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,420
delivery to their customers and get more

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,790
value out of data probably a pretty

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,010
common scenario from any of you either

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,719
going through this challenge yourself or

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,219
on this journey yourself or you're a

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,120
company that helps others go through

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:49,079
this but this company in particular has

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,309
some pretty sizable challenges for one

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,020
they had about three hundred fifteen

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,969
petabytes of data growing at an

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:59,579
exponential rate coming from around

00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,260
140,000 different data sources and if

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,120
you wanted to get access to some of this

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,799
data to actually go and create some

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,080
interesting new solution it could take

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,979
you upwards of six months to get it so

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,750
how does a company like this actually

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,740
deliver any value how do they overcome

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,600
this challenge well in this case this

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,700
particular company really went back to

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,189
their foundation they focused on

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,009
business advocacy getting a seat at the

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,240
table with their key business partners

00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:32,369
understanding the biggest priorities the

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,189
biggest challenges biggest opportunities

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,060
that those different groups had that

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,740
doesn't mean that there were better

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,770
order takers it means they worked hard

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,360
to earn a seat at that table at the same

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,799
time they had to completely rethink the

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,409
corporate data strategy there's no way

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,509
140 thousand different data sources you

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,060
can't solve that overnight it's going to

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,950
take time but they wanted to get back to

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,640
a foundation that they could build on

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,229
that was around connectivity trust

00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,670
availability and now that they've got

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,680
their new friends in the business they

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,049
can do a better job of prioritizing

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,369
which areas of focus in that data

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,670
pipeline they want to they want to

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:10,590
prioritize by doing that they were able

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,720
to start shifting some of the mindset of

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,190
the of the business the culture around

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,410
and

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:19,790
ái and insight driven mindset and doing

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,500
all these things they were able to do

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,090
some pretty impressive things and in

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,820
this particular case this company was

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:30,110
able to drive around forty six million

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,920
dollars of sales uplift in 2018 alone

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,970
using an AI CRM based solution for some

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,070
of their products they were able to

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,800
shave nearly a year off time to market

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,110
and in supply chain a huge cost for many

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,210
of us they were able to save fifty eight

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,490
million dollars again optimizing

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:49,730
inventory using machine learning and AI

00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,500
techniques but they have a long ways to

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,880
go this is only at the beginning they're

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,890
just now building that strong

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,110
partnership with the business now

00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,510
they've got that that flywheel going if

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:03,380
you can do that can you do this really

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,330
really building on that that momentum it

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,950
might surprise you to learn this company

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,560
is actually Intel it's us it's our own

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,480
journey and so I bring this example

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,860
forward not to trick you right summer

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
you were like I can never trust this guy

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,380
again but really to show you how

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,900
important our own journey is in how we

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,390
establish our product portfolio the

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,020
focus of our organizations the way we

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,360
engage with our customers in our case we

00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,940
have about 15,000 software engineers

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,490
across the company working on everything

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,709
from operating systems library

00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,570
optimization open source solutions in

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,750
some cases we've build software if we

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:48,410
see a gap in the market all in an effort

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:50,660
to move data faster store more process

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,070
everything all the things that we're

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,090
here to talk about over the next few

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,560
days we have a great ecosystem partners

00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,420
that are with us here where we can bring

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,930
the best of their solutions with our

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:07,700
portfolio and our learnings to really

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,200
drive new innovations into the market we

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,209
get to also work with some great

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,430
companies like Siemens Novartis NASA

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,680
these are companies that are pushing our

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,910
limits as well and helps us figure out

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,530
are we on the right track are we

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:24,320
delivering the right capabilities and

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:26,630
the right solutions so all this said my

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,330
big ask coming off of today

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,970
as you go through the rest of the show

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,680
as you think about Intel moving forward

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,630
think of us beyond just the silicon

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,330
provider I know that can be the the kind

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,610
of the easy way to think of Intel but

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,680
really think of us as someone that's

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,050
with you on this journey going through a

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,760
lot of the same scenarios building a

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,630
portfolio that's not only there to help

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,880
us on our own path but really to work

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,730
with our different customers and show

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,840
that common thread so come hang out with

00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,550
us in the booth we want to hear about

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,800
what you're going through

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,300
we want to collaborate together and we

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,010
really want to get a better sense of the

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,170
challenges that you're facing and ensure

00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,780
that we're there to support you as a
