Description: 
	Data analytics is the long-standing but constantly evolving science that companies leverage for insight, innovation, and competitive advantage. AI has emerged as a vital tool for reaching higher maturity and scale of data analytics and accelerating the transformation from traditional “operational analytics” that help you understand what happened and why to “advanced analytics” that help you derive real-time insights and predict and plan for the future. AI has unleashed a new era of creativity and ingenuity, but moving solutions from theory to reality and from the one-size-fits-all lab modules development approach to deploying real-world system solutions that are flexible, scalable, and cost-effective have proven to be complex and full of challenges. 

Jeremy Rader explores Intel’s end-to-end data pipeline software strategy designed and optimized for a modern and flexible data-centric infrastructure that allows for the easy deployment of unified advanced analytics and AI solutions at scale.
