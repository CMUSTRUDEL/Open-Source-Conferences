	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,009
I want to take a few minutes to describe

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,140
some recent trends in data and analytics

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,210
and along the way give you some

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,740
highlights of thoughts that will take

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,099
place at this conference over the next

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,619
few days this is our night conference in

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,930
the New York City area and as you can

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,850
see we continue to build a community of

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,730
people and companies interested in using

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:30,210
data technologies so we've always

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:34,550
showcased companies who are using data

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:38,760
to transform their operations and their

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,800
companies and we also have always taken

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,290
pride in our neutrality so we always try

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,390
to give you a complete picture of all

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,430
the tools and methods available so

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,430
ranging from managed services in the

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:54,449
cloud proprietary software and open

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,420
source technologies so we all know that

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,090
the data hungry technologies that we all

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,370
read about so this includes AI and

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,000
machine learning are essentially useless

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,869
without access to reliable high-quality

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,299
data and this community here leads the

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,909
way in building and using world-class

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,220
data infrastructure so let me start by

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,600
giving a quick tour through what's

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,930
happening in these foundational

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,560
technologies so the rise of 5g and IOT

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,020
and the emergence of new data types from

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,619
computer vision so these are images and

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,500
video and speech speech technologies so

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,680
audio means that the technologies we

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,329
have and use need to be able to cope

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,630
with many more different data sources

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:46,470
coming at us at real time so the good

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,439
news is that the community here is

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,140
building technology that is continuing

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,720
to develop the hope with these new

00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,479
challenges

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,880
so Apache spark Kafka and flink

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,320
remain popular open source projects for

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,750
data ingestion data processing and ETL

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,310
over the past year i've started to come

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,739
across companies who are beginning to

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,560
use a new project called apache pulser a

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:16,500
system designed to process and analyze

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,800
and deliver data from an ever-expanding

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,410
array of services and applications so

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,300
there will be tops and pulser and all

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,450
and on all of these other open-source

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:31,350
projects as well as other other tools

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,900
from our sponsors and cloud providers

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,970
and our partners so later this afternoon

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,090
for example we'll have a top on trill

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:44,280
which is the crown jewel of microsoft's

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:46,560
streaming pipeline so over the past year

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,290
I've had many inquiries from companies

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,010
interested in data catalogs data

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,320
governance and data lineage so basically

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,239
companies are looking for solutions that

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,300
will allow them to understand what data

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:04,680
they have who can access it and where

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,230
their data has come from and also that

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,360
the rise of machine learning and the

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,090
importance of ethics privacy and

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
security have made data engineers and

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,750
data scientists much more conscious

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,250
about the importance of data lineage and

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:23,100
provenance so we have many exhibitors

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,680
here including elation Oh Cara

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,840
amudha and speakers who can help you

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,780
understand the range of possible

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,820
features for data governance catalogs

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,070
and lineage so for example this

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,709
afternoon we have back-to-back talks

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,810
from LinkedIn and uber describing their

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:43,170
systems for DES for metadata and data

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,180
governance and Sandeep o'them Chandani

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,820
and his colleagues will explore

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,090
superglue which is into its homegrown

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:55,500
data processing data processing and data

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,690
lineage framework so one of the things

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,600
that I'm gonna emphasize in my short

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,459
talk here is the rise of automation so

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,820
for example machine learning is being

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,910
used to improve data quality there's an

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,220
open source project called hollow clean

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,920
it's a probabilistic data cleaning

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,440
framework considered by many to be the

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,840
state of the art system for using

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:24,030
machine learning for automatic error

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:26,550
detection and repair so data management

00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,360
and storage also remain areas where

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,360
startups and

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,120
bunnies continue to invest in improve

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,729
upon existing technologies so you have

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,909
time series databases like time scale

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,370
and influx DB or graph databases like

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:43,949
Tiger grass that continue to attract

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,280
users and expand on their existing use

00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:49,860
cases also as the number of storage

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,169
systems grow companies are looking into

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,870
data orchestration so these are

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,789
basically systems that abstract data

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,610
access across your many different

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,349
storage systems virtualizes all your

00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,330
data and percents the data via

00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:09,419
standardized api's so data lakes which

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,210
was a subject of this conference over

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,699
the last few years the idea was to store

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,340
everything in one place so your data

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:22,289
team can unlock the value of that data

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:25,560
using bi queries or machine learning but

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:29,699
it turns out that data can be very messy

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,129
right so and those early data lakes had

00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:34,379
the problem that the data quality that

00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:36,810
resided in them was quite low and

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,909
furthermore those earlier systems had

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,120
limitations they couldn't easily cope

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:44,550
with updates and inserts or

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,960
recomputation that are required due to

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,719
mistakes and failures so that today the

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,659
major cloud providers and and companies

00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:57,360
like our partners cloud era or cueball

00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:00,479
or snowflake are beginning to improve on

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,719
data leaks I'm also happy to see open

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,370
source projects like iceberg and

00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,639
specifically data Lake begin to address

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,460
the limitations of these previous

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,189
generation technologies so in particular

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,520
day data Delta Lake can be used with

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:20,580
your existing data Lake it unifies batch

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,650
and streaming and more importantly it

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,169
addresses that fundamental challenge

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,599
which is the Delta Lake lets you

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,189
incremental e improve the quality of

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,349
your data until it is ready for

00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:34,680
consumption and you can do that on an

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:37,919
ongoing basis or in an ad hoc basis and

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,870
for companies who are increasingly using

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,190
machine learning Delta Lake also

00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,460
supports data

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,070
versioning and data lineage so now

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,260
you've got your data collected process

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,960
and stored let's look at what's

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:55,470
happening in terms of analytics and

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,750
machine learning so there's also a lot

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:00,000
of machine learning beginning to be used

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,950
in the area of business intelligence and

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,990
vegetable ization so in particular

00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,000
imagine a scenario where you have

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,330
millions of metrics so it's really

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,020
impossible to make sense of all these

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,100
metrics in the dashboard so what

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,780
companies are beginning to do and

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,450
researchers are beginning to do is use

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,670
machine learning to surface the right

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,450
alerts highlight the right features or

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:26,850
even draw the right charts so for

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,720
example there's a speaker's here from

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:33,210
Ana dot and Sisu to companies who both

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,340
used machine learning to help you make

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,310
sense of mountains of metrics and

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,800
features we also have many many Thompson

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:44,580
bi and visualization including a sex

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,400
session from Akshay Rai of LinkedIn who

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,919
will describe their business wide

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,840
monitoring platform machine learning so

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,700
there's lots of automation happening in

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,130
machine learning so if you already heard

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,120
me highlight hollow clean which is used

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,400
to improve data quality but essentially

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,560
there's a lot of automation happening in

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,630
each of the components of these major

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,100
machine learning platforms so for

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,770
example many of you have probably heard

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,980
of Auto ml which is it's usually

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,840
described usually describes tools for

00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:21,570
automatic model selection and hyper

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,280
parameter tuning but essentially tools

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,040
for machine learning is actually quite

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,340
an exciting area for starting companies

00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,760
so you have tools for model development

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,370
like ml flow and commet ml but there are

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,039
also many many tools now for open source

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:41,460
projects for model ops which includes

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:44,039
model serving and monitoring there's

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,410
even a start up here called super Hawaii

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,260
AI that uses machine learning to help

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:52,530
you monitor your machine learning models

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,810
in production so one area that I think

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:58,590
is less discussed

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,250
our communities model governance I think

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,410
that as companies begin to use machine

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,480
learning more widely particularly

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,090
companies in highly regulated industries

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,200
like finance and healthcare tools for

00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,660
model governance will be quite critical

00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,520
so we have many sessions on the many

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,150
facets of modern machine learning

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,490
platforms so for example Mauritania of

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,560
Intel will give a top under internal

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,540
machine learning platform which is

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,240
widely used by several groups across

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,700
many different countries

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,520
Venkata Guney loved Comcast's and Harish

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,520
Dodi of datatron we'll go through the

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,430
various components of the machine

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:45,000
learning platforms including detailed

00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,070
description of model governance so on

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,680
the area where researchers and

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:52,050
practitioners have coalesced is in

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,690
developing tools and techniques for D

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,510
risking machine learning so here again

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,790
we have many great sessions Mikio Braun

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,280
of solando will give you a nice overview

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:06,360
of tools for fair and privacy-preserving

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:08,700
machine learning and analytics the team

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,710
from the future of privacy forum in

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,290
conjunction with EMU de will host

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,210
back-to-back sessions on privacy and

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:18,720
security in machine learning and

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:21,860
advanced analytics so I've barely

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,270
scratched the surface we have another

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,430
outstanding program for you so for

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,830
example we have many many sessions on

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:32,850
machine learning itself developing

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:35,310
models fine tuning models and deploying

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,870
models to production but don't forget

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:40,140
the network while you're here at the

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,360
conference with our speakers with the

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,710
many interesting companies in our expo

00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,740
hall and of course with your fellow

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:50,240
attendees so for the next two days this

00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,240
is your data community

00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,090
