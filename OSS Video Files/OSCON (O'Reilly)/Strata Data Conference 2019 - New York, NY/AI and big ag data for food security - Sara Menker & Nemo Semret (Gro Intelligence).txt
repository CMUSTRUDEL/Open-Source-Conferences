	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,830
so I'm gonna dive a little bit into the

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,899
data itself now and the biggest

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,570
challenge of the with the data of course

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,309
is just the sheer scale of it volume so

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,679
with satellite data you can imagine

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,379
hundreds and hundreds of environmental

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,550
signals measured for every pixel on

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,830
earth every day for many decades some of

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,600
the non satellite data is also very very

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,670
large-scale you know there's data coming

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
in on a daily basis from over a hundred

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,800
thousand weather stations some of that

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,420
data goes back several hundred years the

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,850
earliest data series I think goes back

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,239
to the 1700s there are also challenges

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,760
related to the data formats whether it's

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,680
how the globe is projected into into

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,140
two-dimensional raster so satellite

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,870
projections dealing with optical

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,329
character recognition to extract text

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,850
data embedded in images that's extremely

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,039
obscure but very valuable of course

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,500
dealing with lots of different human

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,289
languages because this data is reported

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,519
from all over the world dealing with

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,320
data coverage data quality issues

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,500
ranging from the way it's collected by

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,170
human beings with surveys and so on

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,210
could have lots of errors even the

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,439
satellites could have cloud interference

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,439
which means some of the data is not

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,689
available all the time and also we deal

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,640
with obscure things like units that are

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,979
very particular to certain regions of

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,130
the world and and this particular

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,420
industry so that covers the data now

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,579
let's talk a little bit about how we

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,770
organize the data or what we call the

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,500
ontology and this is implemented as a

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,170
knowledge graph the ontology makes us

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,790
deal with fundamental things like time

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,950
for example we're not just dealing with

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,079
time series it's just you know clock

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,450
ticking but we really have to understand

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
time more fundamentally where there's

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,939
crop growth cycles understanding

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,979
seasonality how things progress

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,590
biologically we also have to understand

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,180
what the data is about very deeply you

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,430
know there's dozens and dozens of

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,920
varieties for just wheat for example and

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,140
we have over 10,000 different items or

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,239
crops and it's not just the genetic

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,140
varieties it's where it grows how it

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,150
grows

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,710
it's what categories they belong to

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,060
fruits vegetables here

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,190
and so on all these things are extremely

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,710
important to how the data is organized

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,380
and ultimately used and also things like

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,300
well it's not just the crop itself but

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,340
how much protein is in a particular crop

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,260
and those that influences the ontology a

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,320
lot or how much sugar is inside a

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,940
particular plant and then geography

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,710
you'd think it's fairly straightforward

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,270
but it's actually very complicated when

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,910
you're dealing with this historical data

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,560
now what does it mean what does you mean

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,510
it means many different things depending

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
on what period of time you're looking at

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,260
so understanding all these things and

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
mapping them correctly is enormous ly

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,870
important to having good data putting

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,530
all this together we we currently have

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,960
about 55 million data series this number

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,240
is doubling every six months so we

00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,110
expect it to reach about 200 million by

00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,080
the end of next year and these 55

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:12,630
million data series contain six hundred

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,910
and fifty trillion data points so what

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:17,820
do we do with all this data and and how

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,780
does this actually start to get applied

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,270
to swine fever in China which is what's

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,540
killing the pig herd well to model that

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,610
simple seemingly simple question you're

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,940
essentially modeling the interplay

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,110
between supply demand trade and price

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,910
for every combination of every commodity

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,940
over and over again and then you have to

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,800
multiply that by each country right

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,750
because for each country that China is

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,290
connected to they're you know a slight

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,060
shift in something in Argentina has a

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,490
ramification to the Chinese consumer a

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,130
slight shift by the Chinese consumer

00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,350
could have ramifications to a consumer

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,230
in Kenya and you have to be able to

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,210
capture that and so this is kind of the

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,750
loop that we're essentially closing and

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,750
