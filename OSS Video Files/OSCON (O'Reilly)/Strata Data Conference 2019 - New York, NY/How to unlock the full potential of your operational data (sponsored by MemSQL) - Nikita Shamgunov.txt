Title: How to unlock the full potential of your operational data (sponsored by MemSQL) - Nikita Shamgunov
Publication date: 2019-09-25
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2019 - New York, NY
Description: 
	Data is now the worldâ€™s most valuable resource, with winners and losers decided every day by how well we collect, analyze, and act on data. However, most companies struggle to unlock the full value of their data, using outdated, outmoded data infrastructure. 

Nikita Shamgunov examines the ways businesses use data for competitive advantage, the increased demands and new requirements this puts on data infrastructure, and what you should expect from the tools you use in order to succeed in this new world.

good morning strata my name is Nikita

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,410
and I'm a founder of nem sequel and I've

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,960
been building databases my whole life

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:15,199
two years ago I was here on stage

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,630
talking about names equal the fast

00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,900
database those are some of the logos

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:26,250
that we had and a lot really changed in

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,980
two years and first we evolved from just

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,939
being a fast database to become a

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,300
general-purpose

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:37,590
scalable transactional database and we

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,440
call ourselves the No Limits database we

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,590
have a great partnership with Toyota and

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,460
we've been sponsored a race car it looks

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,399
great but more importantly we're helping

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,520
leaders to modernize their data

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,640
infrastructure and move mission critical

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,510
workloads locked in big Oracle IBM

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,100
sequel server systems to modern cloud

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:09,270
native architecture so we were born fast

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,570
and fast means transaction throughput it

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:16,229
means low query Layton sees but today I

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:19,290
want to talk about the new fast and the

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:24,509
new fast is more than that the new fast

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:28,979
is time to value the new fast is always

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:32,280
on and the new fast is making decisions

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:37,860
right now and driving the time from

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:43,549
event to inside to nothing this is the

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:46,920
new fast the new fast is having a modern

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,890
scalable operational database available

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,899
for you instantly and elastically in the

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,610
cloud so Helius is a multi cloud

00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:02,340
scalable operational database as a

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:05,729
service and in map sequel we always had

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,649
a dual store and that allowed you to

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,050
build your application based on the

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,090
requirements and store data in a

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,500
particular format optimized for your

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,900
workloads

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,070
but the new fast it's having the system

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,770
manage that for you

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,410
and Helius comes with a feature that we

00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,620
call single store that allows you to

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:29,430
just throw the data into an operational

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,200
database and run a huge variety of

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,670
workloads without thinking about

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,010
specifics of the data representation the

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,830
other super important thing in an

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,050
operational database is to being able to

00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,030
claim system of record capabilities and

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,209
that's another thing that I'm proud to

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,430
announce here that Helius come with

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,650
strong system of record and

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,700
transactional capabilities that allow

00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:00,390
you to take workloads from Oracle from

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:04,860
sequel server from IBM and scale them in

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,600
an elastic cost-efficient way with a

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,580
strong system of record and with single

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:15,900
store and one more thing so I've been

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,420
putting a lot of thought into how AI and

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,830
ml are changing the operational data

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:26,670
landscape and what I'm spending a lot of

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,640
time on now is how you can take all

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,920
these models that you can build in your

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,230
favorite tools in tools like tensorflow

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,950
until like scikit-learn and pie tours

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,110
and then put them in production where

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:44,310
they belong next to where the data is

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,860
born next to operational data and this

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,600
is only a step one and a step two in

00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,269
that project we internally call the Big

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,900
Brain is to being able to push a button

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,930
and run auto ml to even bypass the

00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,590
creation of this model and making them

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,959
available for you instantly right next

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,450
to operational data to make all your

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,049
workloads and all your applications

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,360
incredibly smart so we're here at strata

00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:14,910
at the booth and if you are so excited

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,519
about the next operational data

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,709
capabilities and the movement of AR and

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,150
ml towards operational data please find

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,150
us at the booth thank you so much

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,349
