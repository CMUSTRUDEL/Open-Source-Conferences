rajae Mikolas vp of radar at o'reilly

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:07,290
I'm here at Strada New York 2019 I'm

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,510
here with Taylor Knoll who's senior

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,010
product manager big data product

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,099
management welcome thank you

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,650
so Oracle has you know kind of a big

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,480
data and cloud strategy once you get

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,439
into that a little toast about it yeah

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,550
absolutely I mean it's it's a it's

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,529
really kind of an interesting strategy

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,840
because of course we we've been in data

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,099
for a long time you know we we like to

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,810
say internally I don't think we

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,790
publicize it too much that you know we

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,579
we own the world's data like a lot of

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,829
large portion of the world's data sits

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,710
inside of Oracle databases and you know

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,600
and and that's our that's our core

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,610
that's our core product at the same time

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,530
though you know the the opportunity to

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,989
build a public cloud has come up and

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,899
we're aggressively going down going down

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,699
that route and so what we've you know

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,010
what the strategy essentially is to have

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,690
these to have these merge and they're

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,930
absolutely beginning to merge and so

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,609
we're we've begun with you know software

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,100
as a service and data platform as a

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,380
service but essentially it's - its to

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,900
take the strategy is to take our core

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,340
competency of data and to merge it with

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,590
our emerging competency of cloud and put

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,780
those to put this two together Oracle

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,930
has some nvivo positions on the Gartner

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,830
quadrants and how does the cloud extend

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,549
we're doing and kind of complement that

00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:31,200
yeah so so the the Quadrant for for data

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,600
for sure we're in you know we're the

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,990
leader up in the upper right for the

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,490
cloud you know in general infrastructure

00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:41,430
we're moving along quickly in fact we've

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,290
got the we've got the best velocity I

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,710
think of any of the the large public

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,540
cloud providers and so what what were

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,180
you know the plan is exactly that to

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,460
bring what we offer on the cloud which

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,399
is our you know bare metal kind of

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,159
generation to cloud bring that to the

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,869
big data offering so we have we have a

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,250
few services that will be launched in

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,920
the next few months that are built on

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,550
top of that that will that will bring

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,310
performance to the big data space that

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,270
hasn't hasn't previously that's not

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,700
currently out

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,890
so what kind of benefits to commit near

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,260
your clients expect from from bringing

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,630
all this stuff together so the benefits

00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,230
that our customers see by running big

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:28,630
data on our cloud is really boils down

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:32,220
to performance we've got financial

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,910
services customers that are able to see

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,850
performance that they've never seen

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:39,280
before on Prem by running in our cloud

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,500
and the reason is is quite simple I mean

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,900
it's it's our engineers our expertise

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,580
that are tuning where this data lives

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,830
whether it's the database whether it's

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,650
the the software stacks and then running

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:53,110
it on hardware that's been that's been

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,880
designed to offer you know a high level

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,070
of performance for these types of

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,260
applications great

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,140
so you reason enough a partnership with

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,030
VMware and Microsoft to bring more of

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,640
the picture together

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,340
how can your customers like kind of use

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,540
that partnership for their benefit

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,160
absolutely the the partnership

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,130
discussion is actually one that's that's

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,810
really exciting we announced the

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,000
Microsoft partnership earlier in the

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,220
year and this is Microsoft Azure so

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,230
we've connected the the two large

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,720
enterprise clouds are now connected to

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,430
together and that's been that's been

00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,200
extremely exciting extremely valuable

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,489
for our customers because now they can

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,320
whether the data is already living in

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,510
Microsoft Azure and they want to do the

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,100
the compute on our bare metal compute or

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,410
if it's the other way around if the data

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,880
is living on a database on a autonomous

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:45,549
database sitting in the Oracle cloud

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,930
they can pull that into their systems

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:50,380
there are other systems that are running

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,640
on on Microsoft Azure it's it's good

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,160
that you caught the the VMware

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,930
announcement last week Larry was was up

00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,420
on stage talking about our new

00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:01,560
partnership with VMware there's a lot of

00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,510
people both internal to to Oracle into

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,310
and a VMware that expressed their

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,780
surprise that this has happened it's not

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,620
something that they had ever expected to

00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,420
happen but it it makes complete sense

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:18,040
you know there's again going back to

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,979
this this concept that data you know

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,130
data lives on Oracle like we provide a

00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:26,440
good platform for data to live likewise

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,470
there are a lot of applications that

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,690
run on VMware that that want to consume

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,860
this data and so by giving our customers

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:38,320
the ability to run VMware on top of our

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,200
public cloud infrastructure it brings it

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,260
brings the application to the to the

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,640
data and and overall I mean this is this

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,100
is you will continue to see

00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,010
announcements like this from Oracle our

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,840
strategy with partners is to is to make

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,360
our customers happy you know whatever

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,340
our customers are running we're going to

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,660
make that possible if they're running an

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,850
Oracle database and they want to run

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,970
that in the cloud fantastic you can run

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:06,610
autonomous DB in our in our cloud if

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,260
they're running hadoo you know a generic

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,450
Hadoop and they want to run it on our

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,400
cloud great you can you can do that as

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,370
well bring your app to your open source

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,460
or your off-the-shelf software onto our

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,660
bare metal cloud and and you can run it

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,580
there and get better performance than

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,950
what you'd see anywhere else so there's

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,300
a lot of momentum for the cloud what

00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,830
would you tell someone is having trouble

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:33,340
getting their hands around the concept

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:35,650
of the cloud yeah you're not alone the I

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,510
think it's not so much the the concept

00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,890
of lego what is the you know what is the

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,540
cloud what is owning somebody else's

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,970
computer or renting someone else's

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,500
computer but it's how do I harness this

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:48,850
energy you know how do I harness this

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:52,180
capability and you know the the first

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,669
that what we tell people is you know try

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,370
it out hey you know here's 500 bucks go

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,930
spin up an autonomous DB go spin up a

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,400
couple of compute nodes and and do

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,610
something with it

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,560
from a strategic perspective what we

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,230
what we tell what we tell people is

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,220
focus on your core competency you know

00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:13,870
if your core competency is analytics

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,820
focus on analytics let believe the

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,919
infrastructure to us if your core

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:21,760
competency is financial services or

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,190
automotive manufacturing focus on that

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,710
stuff you know stop spending your time

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,900
and your energy and your money on non

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,400
core competencies and and that's what

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,720
the you know that's what it boils down

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,480
to it's the same reason that

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,460
you don't store your your pictures on

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,290
your phone anymore you know let somebody

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,450
else deal with it and just find it when

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:45,190
you need it mm-hmm great well thanks for

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,190
your time today no problem thank you

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,830
