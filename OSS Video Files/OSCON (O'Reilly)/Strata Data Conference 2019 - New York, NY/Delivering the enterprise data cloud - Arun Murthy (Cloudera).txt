Description: 
	An enterprise data cloud can unlock the value of any data anywhere at cloud speed and cloud scale. It has the power to transform our businesses and even the way we live. In this keynote, we’ll introduce you to the new 100% open source Cloudera Data Platform (CDP), the world’s first enterprise data cloud.

we've done a lot of work I've talked to

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,940
a lot of customers and this is one of

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,500
the four principles we came up with when

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,929
we talked about what the enterprise

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,519
actually needs today it has to work on

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,860
multiple floats or any clothes on

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,109
crammed multiple clothes multiple public

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,940
loads private clouds hybrid clubs and so

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,520
on it has to be multi-function like I

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,230
talked about secured and covered end to

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,539
end and open all across we spent time

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,880
with HBR hora Business Review and they

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,099
talked to over 200 customers 200

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,940
enterprises and they came with very very

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,100
similar requirements which is really

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,690
what we've been working on the last nine

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,820
months after the merger of clowder and

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,960
Hortonworks has been sort of a reimagine

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,180
a ssin of everything we have done

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,120
it's a reimagining of the entire stack

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,239
to make it really cloud native make it

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,420
work across multiple floats make it work

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,109
across edge and data center have a

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,739
consistent security and governance layer

00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:04,470
schema metadata security policies

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:06,630
governance lineage and migration we

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,340
talked about the multiple workloads we

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,320
have this notion we call the data hub

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,610
which is equivalent to EMR or HD insight

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,400
and I've had the pleasure of working in

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,020
Microsoft for a long time I've seen site

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,479
but for more than that it's all about

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,890
these experiences whether it's data flow

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,150
whether it's data engineering whether

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,119
it's machine learning or warehousing

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,710
these experiences we have adapted the

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,700
entire stack to work natively on

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,409
kubernetes this allows us to actually do

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,180
really amazing things like scale it up

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,119
and down in matter of seconds and

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,729
provide a SAS like offering to the

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,170
enterprise running in the public load

00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:42,000
even better we can actually now bring

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,159
that not just in the public cloud but

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,720
also on Prem which is really what the

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,619
Cloud Data Platform private cloud

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,619
edition is about

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,810
