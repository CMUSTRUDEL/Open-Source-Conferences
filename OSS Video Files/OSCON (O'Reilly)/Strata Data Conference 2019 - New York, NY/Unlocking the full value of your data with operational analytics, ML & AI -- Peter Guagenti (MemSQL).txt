hi Rajyam goes here with Peter Clemente

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,550
who's the CMO of mem sequel welcome

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,050
thank you and we you know want to start

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,030
off with like what trends are you seeing

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,820
in this kind of insight driven economy

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,920
we face it's very interesting that we're

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,350
seeing a number of trends emerging and

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,869
actually O'Reilly done a very good job

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,180
of promoting some of the more

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,519
interesting ones I think one of the most

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,170
exciting for us is ml nai

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,080
right I think we've been talking about

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,570
ml and AI for a long time but I feel

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,579
like in the last few years we've really

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,290
seen an acceleration inside of the

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,390
average enterprise you know it's not

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,280
just the big software companies big

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,890
technology companies we're now seeing

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,860
democratization of models we're seeing a

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,850
lot more real world application of ML

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,170
nai towards common business problems and

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,640
you know I feel like we're we're now

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,210
starting to see companies climbing the

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,440
maturity curve from historical analytics

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,350
sort of looking backwards at what

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,940
happened increasingly in to looking at

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,040
what is happening and then trying to

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,049
predict what will happen and drive the

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,439
future that's the biggest trend I think

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,000
we're seeing as a database company we're

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,500
seeing some others you know the biggest

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
challenger nml in AI is not the

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,159
algorithms it's not data science it's

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,659
data it's actually being able to

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,820
aggregate and work with your data in a

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,350
meaningful way we're seeing that

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,780
accelerating we're seeing a lot of

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,700
companies waking up and realizing the

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,960
next generation of their business their

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,860
applications and analytics that are

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,000
going to power their business they're

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,110
gonna require different data

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
infrastructure than they've had in the

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,250
past and so there's increasing demands

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,229
on companies like mmmm sequel to provide

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,810
stuff that'll work with streaming and

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,350
real-time and historical data together

00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:45,090
and we're also seeing now the next wave

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,270
of data moving to the cloud you know we

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,710
saw you know starting ten plus years ago

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,840
now we saw application data moved to the

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,049
cloud first it's fairly low risk very

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,579
high reward you know for time to market

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,950
the next wave was data warehousing you

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,479
know historical data at scale great

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,000
commoditization to move it to the cloud

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,439
it's very cost effective now the crown

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,990
jewels are starting to move to cloud

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,009
infrastructure and that's really

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,390
exciting we're seeing a lot of the

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,649
analysts talking about that we're

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,200
obviously being a cloud native

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,250
operational database we love that right

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,420
because that's really good for

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,340
our future but we're also seeing

00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,720
maturity now in cloud infrastructure and

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,910
in multi cloud and hybrid cloud strategy

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,990
that make that possible I think for

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,390
those of us who've been in cloud native

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,460
for a very long time it's nice to see

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,530
now this level of maturity that means we

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,530
can unlock that flexibility while not

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,209
giving up control so given that mores

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,580
going on our company is really getting

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,950
the full value from their David they're

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,690
not and and this is I think the thing

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,270
that most CEO should start paying

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,050
attention to you know I think it's very

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,660
easy for a CEO to look and say well date

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,010
date is the domain of my CIO they're

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,530
gonna take care of it you know she'll

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,630
she'll know what to do with it but if

00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,250
you really look look at the brands that

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,930
have really started to establish

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,150
dominance in the last five to ten years

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,520
I would make an argument that they have

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,770
done so on the back of leveraging data

00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,450
better than their competitors and

00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,970
specifically operational data right it's

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,820
not looking back and and understanding

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,620
what had occurred it's leveraging data

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,330
to make decisions in real time and

00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,790
running predictions and running machine

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,310
learning to make better decisions then

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,320
then you could otherwise and that's a

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,570
big deal right I think if you look at a

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,510
company like uber you know I would argue

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,310
they use data to completely change and

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,750
revolutionize transportation you know

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,910
they know exactly where to place cars

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,230
using models you know exactly how much

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,959
to charge you based on what you're

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,010
willing to pay that has dropped a bomb

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,390
in the middle of the transportation

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,160
business we've seen the same in

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,989
financial services with companies like

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,850
Goldman Sachs treating themselves as a

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,290
technology company I think every

00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,140
business is in that place if I were a

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,239
CEO in a in a traditional business right

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,400
now I would be getting real smart real

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,519
fast about how my data is being stored

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,010
how my date is being used and asking the

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,769
hard questions internally to say are we

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,480
prepared to be able to actually get the

00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,860
maximum value from our data to build

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,140
competitive advantage because your

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,209
competitors are they are going to do it

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,070
and you know it's we're at a point in

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,450
time now I believe we're back to another

00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,070
we went from digital transformation

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,019
which changed a bunch of industries so

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,760
now a data revolution it's the next wave

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,840
of digital transformation and I think

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,849
there are a lot of businesses that will

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,240
not make it through given the background

00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,699
you just said what can someone do now

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,810
factors are play in getting that

00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:36,139
knowledge so realistically there needs

00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:40,099
to be a lot more thought given to how we

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,389
collect store and and analyze data right

00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,729
and and what we're doing to make it

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,449
possible for more of the business to

00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:46,729
make use of it

00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:48,349
big data came with a big promise right

00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:49,610
which was if you get all of your data in

00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:52,099
one place you're gonna be able to do

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,229
amazing things with it unfortunately the

00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:56,840
first wave of tools that most of us

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:59,240
embraced didn't ever fulfill on that

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,370
promise and you know while data

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,460
infrastructure sounds really boring you

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,630
know so did ERP systems in the 80s and

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,150
you look at the businesses that

00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,750
completely took over their category by

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,919
getting supply chain better than others

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,030
CRM and the 90s you know but the

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,919
customer the companies that became

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,840
customer centric first were the ones who

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,340
dominated you know I think we're in the

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,930
same place with data now you know and I

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,569
think executives need to be paying a lot

00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:26,000
more attention to you know how their

00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:27,319
data is being stored internally and

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,720
asking themselves the fundamental

00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,949
question of if I have a big idea if I

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,509
have an application I want to do if I

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:33,530
have a decision I want to make can I act

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:36,020
on that right now

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,789
can I actually do that because I think

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,560
if they asked that question a said hard

00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:42,259
question internally they would hear a

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,690
lot of knows we work with an oil and gas

00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,159
company they're in the oil gas oil and

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,469
gas exploration and extraction business

00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:52,880
they're considered one of the leaders in

00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:55,460
their space and their CEO has a tablet

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,009
that has a dashboard that is every key

00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,870
metric in the business from discovery

00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:02,690
through extraction through through all

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:05,360
the way up to refining or just the last

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,340
thing they hand off to and he can at a

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,280
moment's notice based on the data from

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,139
the day know how the business is doing

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,210
that company actually claims to make

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:16,039
more revenue per employee than anyone

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,360
else in their business you think about

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,130
that think about how that might apply in

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,599
your business whatever it is you know

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,669
that's the place we need to get to and

00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,250
when we have conversations about data

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,690
and data tools and data infrastructure

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,330
that CEO will have that conversation

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,130
with us alongside the CIO just like they

00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,960
would if they were talking about supply

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,000
chain or go to market or any other part

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,190
of their business so maybe you can

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,020
describe the EM sequel Helios product

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,600
and

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:43,030
what customers using that for it's a

00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,770
great question so we announced actually

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,320
we announced the product today so mem

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:51,730
sequel Helios is in what we call public

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,080
preview we have been looking at the

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,710
database as a service market for quite

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,170
some time

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,880
and we are we are as I talked about

00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,350
before we're cloud native operational

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,670
database right so what do I mean by

00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,040
cloud native we're a distributed

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,920
architecture we were designed to make

00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,600
use of VMs or containers or commodity

00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,330
hardware and operated high-performance

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,780
and more than 60% of our customers were

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:15,130
running us in cloud in the public cloud

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,700
not counting private cloud instances not

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:21,400
counting hybrid and so the big question

00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
that we kept getting was can you run it

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,830
for me

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,230
right can you can you just can I just

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,070
buy it on consumption and we held back

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,240
for a while

00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,980
and we held back for a while actually

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,420
because of the other innovations that

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,850
were happening in cloud and then also

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,840
waiting to see what you know when we

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,490
started to see momentum our own

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,470
operational data that time is now right

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,030
so the data is moving we've been able to

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,170
leverage a lot of great work being done

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,890
in communities like the kubernetes

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:48,580
community so that we now have a fully

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,830
managed available service you know all

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,360
the full features of mem sequel running

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,280
literally at the click of a button so

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,230
press the button in moments you have a

00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,970
cluster up and running it has all of the

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,180
features no none of the none of the

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,380
trade-offs and it is fully managed to

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,150
the point of where all you have to worry

00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,860
about is your schema on your data our

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,660
long-term view here is would it be great

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,910
if you just had a really powerful sequel

00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,970
API in the cloud we want it to be that

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,650
simple and helios this first release of

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,080
Helios is the first step of that right

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:20,130
so where do you see them sequels fit and

00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,390
the huge spectrum of database companies

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:25,510
so we believe there's a fundamental

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,310
change occurring and it used to be that

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,940
the database world was broken into OLAP

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:33,340
in our LTP companies like ours

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,290
we're category sometimes as new sequel

00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,030
the sort of third wave of database

00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,440
innovation you know first being the

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,700
traditional database innovation that

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,860
occurred with Microsoft and Oracle

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,330
before them you know the next wave with

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,940
no sequel which was really about serving

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,020
the developer this new sequel movement

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,640
is about bringing those two worlds

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,860
together into the modern age

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,900
you know we first saw the collapse of

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,520
OLTP and OLAP under new sequel into

00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,440
trans litical is what some people call

00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,390
it or you know every analyst firm has a

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,320
fancy way of describing it but but

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,970
really what what we see is not that old

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,430
language what we're really seeing here

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,830
is a bifurcation between historical data

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,020
and working with historical data think

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,000
data warehouses think you know data

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,370
scientists working with pools of data or

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,870
in regulated industries that you know

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,880
regulatory and compliance logging of

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,130
everything right because you need it and

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,110
then operational data that mix of

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,940
streaming real-time and historical data

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,400
that you're working with right now to

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,280
either run apps or analytics that's our

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,930
world and that's where we're focused and

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,250
what we're seeing here is this new wave

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,380
of apps and analytics are being built

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,830
require infrastructure like that our

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:42,860
long view here is we want to be the

00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:45,050
go-to choice for operational data if you

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,580
care about being multi cloud we think

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,890
the cloud service providers all have

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,780
very solid solutions in this space they

00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,990
will continue to innovate in their

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:57,320
categories you know we see things like

00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:00,410
Aurora and spanner and azure sequel as

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,990
as the same we're all in the same

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,480
journey and we want to be that multi

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,530
cloud alternative to those things we

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,880
think we have the right engineering

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,410
talent to do it we think we have the

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,270
right customers to do it who are driving

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,920
us you know top we have five of the top

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,660
ten banks in North America our customers

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,500
running critical applications and

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,670
pushing on us for what's next and

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,130
long-term what we think the potential

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,400
here is to start replacing all that

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,930
legacy stuff so you know we see a lot of

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,670
customers switching to mem sequel from

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,370
Oracle we see a lot of customers

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,500
switching mmm sequel from ASAP Hana from

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,830
other legacy databases like that when

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,050
you converge the new apps and analytics

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,970
you converge this real time you converge

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,340
streaming and historical data into one

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:46,190
decision layer in things like models and

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,800
then layer in cloud there's a massive

00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,450
opportunity for someone to take over

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,580
that market and we want it to be us

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,970
great well thanks for your time today

00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,970
thank you

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,800
