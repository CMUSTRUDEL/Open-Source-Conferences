Imagine watching sports and being able to immediately find all plays that are similar to what just happened. Better still, imagine being able to draw a play with the Xs and Os on an interface like a coach draws on a chalkboard and instantaneously finding all the similar plays and conduct analytics on those plays (i.e., when those plays occur, how many points a team expects from that play). Additionally, imagine having the ability to evaluate the performance of a player or a team in a given situation and compare it against another player in exactly the same situation.

This approach is called interactive sports analytics, and Patrick Lucey explains methods to find play similarity using multi-agent trajectory data, as well as predicting fine-grain plays. You’ll see examples using tracking data amassed from the Stats Perform massive sports data archives. And you’ll learn how you can go beyond center-of-mass tracking (i.e., dots) and capture body-pose information from broadcast video to take analysis to the next level.

	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,100
so how do we actually search in sport so

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,410
I'm going to show this video it's taken

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,929
a couple of years ago but if you're

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,670
Lakers fan you might find this

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,219
interesting

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,350
so we have this play let's just say I'm

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:19,050
a coach or I'm in media I'm someone at

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,810
home and I say well I want to find all

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,330
the place like that how many times has

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,570
that happened the fundamental question

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,340
here is how do I actually query that

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,750
well what I could do I could go to

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,239
YouTube and I could say it's a

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,730
three-point shot so in this season there

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,739
was over 40,000 three-point shots so I'm

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,320
going to retrieve I'm gonna get a list

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,899
of 40,000 shots here now I have the

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,969
tracking data and the tracking data

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,460
allows us to be a bit more specific with

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,809
our language so for those who are

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,629
familiar with basketball you could set a

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,730
pick and pop or two back behind the back

00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,640
pass by Steve Nash and occurred at top

00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,100
of the three-point line however if I

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,260
wanted to know where all the players

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,710
were their speed velocity acceleration

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,740
and the events how many words would I

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:11,400
need to describe that well the answer is

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,040
a lot and it begs the question when

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,630
we're actually searching in sport what

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,000
is the language what is the query

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,530
language that we should use so the

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,530
longest period of time we've been using

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,049
words words just don't cut it

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,030
okay so we have tracking data what is

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,560
the purpose of tracking data red is the

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,780
ball Green is attacking yellows

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,210
defending that is representing what we

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,799
see in the pixels so that is a perfect

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,240
representation low dimensional

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,880
representation of what we see in the

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,360
pixels not only is it low dimensional

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,909
it's interprete belen interactive so if

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,829
I have that play imagine if I could ask

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,100
the question far me other plays like

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,020
that I can't describe it via words but I

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,880
have that example I have that visual

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,860
query find me other plays like that well

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,020
we can do that now and so it's a

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,490
paradigm shift and how we query instead

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,740
of using words we want to use the visual

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,240
modality forty to fifty percent of our

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,000
brain is associated with the visual

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,280
cortex let's get that to work and so

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,440
this is a concept of chalk boarding so

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,880
this is in a couple of our products

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,650
that's perform but I'll give you the

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,900
intuition here so thicker this is

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,760
YouTube for sport so we have the

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,770
tracking data which is representing what

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,960
we've seen the pixels and so we just

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,180
have a video player here and let's just

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,610
say I play a game and what you're going

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,790
to see is the tracking data so I just

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,560
pick a game of interest and I say and I

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,660
can just get it streaming again red is

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,330
the ball yellow is going left to right

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,210
and green is going right to left and so

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,740
I can I can get the human to select how

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,840
long the play is so just say it's a

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,540
three second play and I could scrub

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,700
through to find what is interesting or

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,710
it could be streaming live and so

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,380
imagine if I get to a point in the game

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,810
ago or stop find me other place like

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,460
that I click a button in less than a

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,860
second I can give you a ranked list of

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,500
all the plays like that but this is

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,310
inherently interactive this is

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,380
interprete ball

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,850
so imagine if I could say well I'm only

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,530
interested in a couple of those plays in

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,450
the ball find me all the plays like that

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:18,060
and then I have a refine list there oh I

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,980
have an iPad or over over I have some

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,170
type of interactive device why can't I

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:28,140
draw a player inquiry that that's what

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,820
we can do now okay what I get really

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,680
excited think that's cool but what I get

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,390
really excited about is the idea of what

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,950
if it's how imagine you've had this play

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,000
I could say we'll stop tell me

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,520
everything about that what's the

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,770
likelihood of this player score in that

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,100
position one times if I move that player

00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,750
around one time say if I moved that

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,260
defender around how does that change the

00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:51,090
percentage or what I'm say if I switch

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,420
that player with another player how does

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:56,580
that change so it's the interface to

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,470
enable us to ask the questions that we

00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,420
really want and now machine learning an

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,630
interactive interface we can start to do

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,630
this

00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,580
