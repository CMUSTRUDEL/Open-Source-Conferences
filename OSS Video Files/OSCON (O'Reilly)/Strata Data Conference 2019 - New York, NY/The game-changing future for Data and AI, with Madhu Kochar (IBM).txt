hi Roger McGough is here with Matt who

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,140
Kochhar who's vice-president of product

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,240
development at IBM we're gonna talk some

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,730
about AI welcome Thank You Ronnie

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,559
so how do you see the future of data in

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,690
a night or so you know linked together

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,029
unfolding yes totally as we all know

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,010
right data is the foundation for all the

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,070
businesses to drive their smarter

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,220
decisions and what are those decisions

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,180
the only way through AI you can truly

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,940
unlock the value of the data so that's

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,559
why data in AI coming together it's huge

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,300
we actually changed our division and we

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,210
are calling data in AI so I'm part of

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,489
the private element data which is great

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,800
but truly that is and the future of it

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,820
is really where the businesses want to

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,899
take there is so many amazing

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,850
applications which are getting developed

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,890
new business models which are getting

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,859
developed almost in every industry right

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,899
this is not one of those where only one

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,530
industry is falling but across the

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,869
industries across enterprises multiple

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,510
applications are coming up with AI and

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,360
in the when we first started this

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,640
journey it was about it was all about

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,610
automation and like we could reduce the

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,890
cost but it's changed drastically right

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,920
now it's all about revenue it's all

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,740
about growth which AI can help because

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,100
of driving new insights from the data

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,900
mm-hmm so we've heard I've been talking

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,049
about data virtualization as a game

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:38,130
changer and game changer maybe you can

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:42,740
explain that a little yeah sure so think

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,630
about the world of today it's no longer

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,180
maybe I should say it's a hybrid world

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,570
out there right it's hybrid cloud you

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,820
got your data your applications your

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,990
workloads residing behind the firewall

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,630
and people got more than one cloud out

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,700
there so it is a multi cloud and a

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,020
hybrid journey because you can be in one

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,740
or the other

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,239
and there is going to be a need for

00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,489
applications to run in a place where

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,470
they need to leverage data either

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,930
sitting in your operational data stores

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,319
or data collected through some social

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,430
media and sitting on some other cloud

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,680
you're not gonna be moving the data

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,849
around to get insights because that's

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,700
costly right

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:29,280
that is where dear virtualization comes

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,480
into play meaning you could have one

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,060
control point without impacting your

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,489
data sources and it doesn't matter what

00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,430
type of data sources you have you could

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,980
have access to that data easy access

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,940
with sequel dialect you could do joins

00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,130
across various types of sources think of

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,130
your operational cash builds like you

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,870
immediately get your answer set and able

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:59,819
to query it able to make that into

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,769
quote-unquote a data set for data

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,220
scientists to go start working building

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,650
models iterating and whatnot but the

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,519
most fundamental differentiator with

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,970
that is all these virtualized objects so

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,870
to speak they are cataloged in our data

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:22,380
catalog so you're able to get the

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,780
lineage and understand where these data

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,670
originated from right and you have the

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,220
whole metadata so you can build your

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,040
technical lineage your application your

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,500
business lineage and that is where it

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,470
helps towards the end of the story

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,780
because nobody is pushing their models

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,299
into production now right without saying

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:47,970
hey is there bias in this model is it

00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:50,250
where did this data was trained on right

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,900
so you need to be able to provide

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,000
lineage you need to be able to provide

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,120
information for audit reasons and such

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,739
that is where the differentiation of us

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,079
that's why we call it a game-changer

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,650
because it's not just the access and the

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,530
join but it's really having end-to-end

00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,630
journey of your data objects virtually

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,640
objects so on the data side obviously

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,020
that is really important we're doing any

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,170
yeah you know they've got you've got

00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,880
Auto AI yes and how will that kind of

00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:21,690
fit into the equation sure

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,330
so so you know we've been talking about

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,030
data scientists and you know the skill

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,190
sets of no understanding machine

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,620
learning algorithm stats and other

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,380
things and industry and domain knowledge

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,360
right very important

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,070
most of the stuff can be automated but

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,510
what cannot be automated as your domain

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,300
knowledge and your industry knowledge

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,610
right and when we were seeing the

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,560
struggles of business leaders wanna

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,440
leverage AI but they're struggling to

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,620
operationalize it sometimes it's lack of

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,560
skills right or or whatever other things

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,650
comes on their way so we came up with

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,200
over the new offering called Auto AI

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,500
meaning all the hard work which the data

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:07,470
scientists have to do how can we

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,720
automate those pieces so that clarity of

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,350
domain and industry they can bring in

00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,980
but we automatically automate a lot of

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,260
the processes in terms of how does your

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,840
training data looks like how are your

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,810
models working on this

00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,450
how are your algorithms behaving on top

00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,340
of this training data right and are

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,669
they're degrading as they're going into

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,580
production right and coming up with

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,780
automated feature engineering or

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,840
automation of a lot of parameter

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,970
optimization so so we're take trying to

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,190
take a lot of hard work and mundane

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,890
tasks a data scientist would have to do

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,500
and how do we do AI for AI it sort of

00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:53,280
speak right that's what the magic of all

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,320
Auto a is well we've heard the term that

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,260
you've used data ops maybe you can

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,300
explain that a little bit oh sure I'm so

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,390
glad Roger you you heard that we talked

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,900
about data ops so remember DevOps days

00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,110
right

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,600
so what DevOps did for for developers

00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,940
like you know automating the CI CD

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,310
pipelines and such and we just talked

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,560
about how AI is important data is

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,750
important and there was a there was a

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,479
research done by figure-eight recently

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,100
where they said the data scientists who

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,620
were brought in to do their

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,770
work around building models and and

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,750
looking for future insights and outcomes

00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,870
80% of them were spending their time on

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,790
data preparation like figuring out where

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,830
is their data is the data clean as their

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,140
data classified according to their

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,630
business to their enterprise terms is

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,360
the data labeled right what is the

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,300
quality of that data right and is their

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,520
bias in this training data so that's

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,940
where most of the time is being spent so

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,430
we I don't think we kind the term data

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,890
ops it has been out there but I feel

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,350
like data ops will due to data what

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:04,410
DevOps did to that and think of data ops

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,800
as a methodology a framework which

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:11,160
brings in process people and the tech so

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,860
we have really worked out again the

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,750
example like I gave for auto AiAi for AI

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,970
we have really introduced a lot of

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,400
machine learning and AI into this

00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,230
journey of data operations so that

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,480
ingestion and classification and

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,300
cleaning this whole thing goes from

00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,000
where people used to spend quarters and

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,160
months down to literally days and weeks

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,300
so that's the whole story about data ops

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,890
right and just I'd go back to you talk

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,660
about how important multi clouds is and

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,220
that's what you're seeing maybe you can

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,870
say you know what kind of benefits there

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,850
are to the multi cloud approach so

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,570
benefits are plenty for clients because

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,070
you know enterprises are acquiring

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,540
applications different businesses are

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,340
coming and everybody is bringing their

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,840
own stack together nobody wants to move

00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,510
the data we just talked about that

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,390
earlier so the the aspects of

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,510
multi-cloud really what what enterprises

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:11,310
are looking for is can we really truly

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:13,950
build cloud native applications meaning

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,780
you build ones and run it anywhere right

00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,270
that's all about efficiency it's all

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,950
about scale it's all about you know

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,620
outcomes end of the day it's all about

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,930
that and then the other critical part

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,380
what I'm hearing from our enterprises is

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,380
you know pick whatever cloud vendor they

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,530
want to do but they don't want

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,990
locking they don't want to use the local

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,729
native services of the cloud because

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,610
then that comes in the way of

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:43,520
portability right so that's what our

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,320
point of view is look we truly if we

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,120
truly gonna be multi cloud we need to be

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,330
able to really build one runs anywhere

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,920
and it's we're building a lot on open

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,890
source obviously we are adding a lot of

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,200
our proprietary tack on it to bring the

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,480
whole story together we did that with

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,450
our offering we call cloud pack for data

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,310
which is really our truely data and AI

00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,430
platform which brings all these aspects

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,920
of our AI and data ops and multi-cloud

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,480
there and it is important because I

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,880
think for a long time your children are

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,770
being a hybrid world so focusing the

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,120
tech and technology in this area is

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,590
going to be critical right it actually

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
ties with some of the research we've

00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,610
been doing so that makes a lot of sense

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,510
yeah so thanks for your time today

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,510
yeah Thank You Roger

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,730
