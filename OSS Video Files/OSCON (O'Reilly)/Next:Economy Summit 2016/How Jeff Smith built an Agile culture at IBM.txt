Description: 
	Since he was tapped as IBM’s CIO in 2014, Jeff Smith has been playing a second key role: transforming IBM’s internal software development culture to one that mirrors the Agile, user-centered, data-driven, and cross-functional approach that characterizes today’s Silicon Valley startups.
