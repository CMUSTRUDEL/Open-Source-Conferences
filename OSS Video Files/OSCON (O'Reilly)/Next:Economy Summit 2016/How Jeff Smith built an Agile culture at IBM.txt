Publication date: 2016-10-28
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Since he was tapped as IBM’s CIO in 2014, Jeff Smith has been playing a second key role: transforming IBM’s internal software development culture to one that mirrors the Agile, user-centered, data-driven, and cross-functional approach that characterizes today’s Silicon Valley startups. Except he’s doing it for a team of 20,000 people, in support of a company with over 400,000 employees. We’ll talk with Jeff about what it takes to get a hundred-year-old company to change course.

I mean we have certain you know

00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:06,549
principles you know clarity is more

00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:08,820
important than than certainty course

00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:11,049
corrections better than perfection

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,509
self-directed teams over command and

00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:16,450
control talent density Trump's process

00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:18,400
density any day and our philosophy is if

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:20,200
we can break down a great big group

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,390
until lots of small teams so think of

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,360
not four hundred thousand Ivy embers but

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:27,250
forty thousand squads of ten and then if

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,260
I can take lots of problems and break

00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,230
big problems in the small problems I can

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,210
multi process it across those squads in

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,420
the same way that computers do that with

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,769
multi processors and CPUs then I can get

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,149
the scale of in a you know the

00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:43,420
innovation of the best small tech

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:46,230
companies but the scale of an IBM so

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,230
