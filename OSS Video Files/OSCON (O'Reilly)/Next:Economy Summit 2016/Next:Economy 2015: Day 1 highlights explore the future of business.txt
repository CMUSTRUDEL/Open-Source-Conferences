the way things go is not inevitable we shape the future we have built these

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,950
tools and it's up to us to use them correctly reasoning is not magic

00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,320
genuinely intelligent systems are coming we've already seen the beginning of them

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,730
it turns out the bar is incredibly low we'll anthropomorphize almost anything

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,880
that is what the species does in robot land once a self driving car makes a mistake

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,060
no other car will make the same mistake including all the future unborn cars

00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,309
and that means the learning speed of machines is fundamentally faster than

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:40,210
the learning speed of people every job I've ever had as an engineer and some respect is

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,969
to replace labor when now we're about to do it incredibly well and we're not thinking

00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,739
about the consequences

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:53,000
a lot of jobs really have what I call an interpersonal or human component nobody

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,460
wants to go to an undertaker who goes I am so sorry for your loss

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,920
you know that's a robot hardware design can be an artful medium it can be a form

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,630
of expression it could be something where you are not trying to make something because

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:09,650
you think there's a market size of you know a half a million consumers who will

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,040
buy you can just make something cuz it's seems cool and you can move on but I've

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,960
got this right here in my Soho factory and adorable line with a stenciler

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,460
and a pick and place and a board loader and oven and and yeah I'm able to design and

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,930
manufacture five seconds apart from industrial company when I say industrial I'm

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,930
talking about railroads airlines people that make engines and gas

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:39,159
firms like us if we don't grab this next wave of the information age we're not be

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,509
able to generate the kind of productivity that is required to be

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,990
competitive business is constantly tell you we can't find the right people the

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,119
right skills and yet another people looking for work so there's something

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,189
about labor markets that doesn't work very well in creating any marketplace

00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,530
business you really have to think about the balance of the expectations in our

00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,759
case of decline in the consumer and then the needs of the supplier in the task

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,420
and you have to find a way to balance those two things and have the meeting

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,959
middle otherwise the market doesn't me and you don't you don't have a

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,730
marketplace business we are people and that we need consideration in

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:24,580
communication with our employers to make working feasible to make it bearable and

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,530
