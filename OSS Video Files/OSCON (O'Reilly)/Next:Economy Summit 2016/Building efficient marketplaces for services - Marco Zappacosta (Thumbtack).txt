Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	While Thumbtack doesn’t have the high profile of Uber or Airbnb, it’s become a crucial lubricant of the small-business economy of the modern city, helping consumers find skilled professionals they can trust and helping those professionals find customers.

it's a big difference between us and say

00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,120
a task rabbit is that we're focused on

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,700
professional services and these aren't

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,670
folks that provide a sort of

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:14,050
undifferentiated labor to help augment

00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,690
something that you could otherwise do

00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:18,699
yourself these are craftsmen these are

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,070

they're not fungible the big thing that

00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,940
we have realized is that the greatest

00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,420
unlocked resource that this country has

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,879
is the talent and time of its

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,579
professional class and we're trying to

00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,819
build a platform to unlock all that sort

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:49,440
of latent potential energy such that we
