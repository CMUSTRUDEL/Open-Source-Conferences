you've kind of made the point that it's

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,990
just not one thing it's not just well

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,559
technology is gonna put people out of

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,360
work it's a bunch of forces you kind of

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,180
lay out for it's just your sense of what

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,640
are the big questions and challenges the

00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,080
economy's facing right now well thanks

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,740
Tim I'm delighted to be here with the

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,720
chair view whether is I think about so

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,359
that this next economy there are

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,189
basically about four or five Biggie's if

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,140
you like or big things we're gonna need

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,600
to grapple with and how we deal with

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,160
these four or five things will make the

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,290
difference between sort of happy how

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,480
comes and quite frankly potentially

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,640
really challenging outcomes and the four

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,149
the four or five as follows the first

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,000
one is related to automation and jobs

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,790
I mean we've made incredible progress in

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,739
the last decade much more than we've

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,379
done in the last 50 quite frankly on

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,870
robotics automation autonomous systems

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,520
machine learning artificial intelligence

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,190
and it's the progress has been

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,439
astounding mostly thanks to all the

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,240
algorithms but also the massive amount

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,859
of compute power and data that we now

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,539
have available but this is gonna have a

00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,779
profound impact on how we think about

00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:14,609
work on the one hand we like technology

00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:16,950
and innovation because it leads to

00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,810
productivity gains and growth we saw

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,579
that in agriculture sort of seen that in

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,049
manufacturing and now we're seeing it

00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,729
everywhere so this is a big one and how

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,520
we deal with it so that's the first one

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,200
the second one is you know we find

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,619
ourselves in a very interesting point in

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,529
time where we now don't quite know how

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,549
we think about globalization and

00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:37,529
globalization is one of those things

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,749
that if you look in the last two or

00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:41,849
three decades more people have been

00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:45,179
lifted out of poverty in the world

00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:47,159
through globalization and trade you know

00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,289
one of the standing things is that the

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,709
only the only reason the Millennium

00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:55,679
Goals made the mark on reducing poverty

00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:56,849
was primarily through trade the 700

00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,950
million people that were lifted out of

00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,319
poverty was through trade and yet we're

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,109
the interesting place in our economy and

00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,729
even you know political dialogue where

00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,590
we're not quite sure how we think about

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,929
trade now of course trade has many

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,150
benefits but at the same time there are

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,739
some adverse effects for workers and

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,670
industries that get moved around so

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,020
that's an important one

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,450
we grapple with it because on the one

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,099
end we shouldn't throw out globalization

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,840
but how do we fix it

00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,670
so that's second thing the third thing

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,099
is one that you know many people are

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,110
feeling right now which is the whole

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,940
issue around inequality and the fact

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,190
that wages have largely been stagnant

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,930
for quite a while and it's quite

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,480
striking particularly in advanced

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,950
economies you know we've done some work

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,319
looking at advanced economies one things

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,940
you find is that something like two

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,280
thirds of people living in advanced

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,470
economy households have not seen their

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,700
market incomes go up in fact many of

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,989
them were actually dropped in the last

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,600
ten to fifteen years

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,940
and it's no surprise that those are all

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,830
so often people are very upset about the

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,769
system not working very well for them

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,900
and perhaps may even be leading to some

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,970
of this populist dialogues we have right

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,160
now so how we deal with incomes

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,769
inequality is a really really profound

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,040
issue and then the fourth one of course

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,180
is speaks too much of what you've been

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
talking about and read you've been

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,910
talking about which is how do we get

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,920
more people to participate in the

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,239
economy how do we get more

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,640
entrepreneurship how do we get more

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,709
participation and increasingly this you

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,150
know this won't happen on its own we

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,100
have to build the platforms and tools

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,530
and mechanisms that allow this to happen

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,390
and then of course there's the big issue

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,850
around sustainability and climate change

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,400
but the reason I point out to these four

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,540
or five things Tim is that you know

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,640
we're not going to get too happy

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,320
outcomes on their own I think quite

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,820
often in Silicon Valley we often think

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,680
you know we run the risk of being

00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,650
criticized for kind of Technol up Tim

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,310
ISM that it'll all work out on its own

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,310
