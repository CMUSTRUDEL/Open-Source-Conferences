Title: A conversation with Colin Megill (pol.is)
Publication date: 2016-10-30
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	It’s pretty clear that today’s politics are broken. It’s time for us to reinvent deliberation about hard issues. pol.is, Colin’s company, has already helped Taiwan develop groundbreaking regulations for on-demand transportation, regulations that brought together the public, cities, and the on-demand companies themselves in a productive conversation. We’re now looking to bring this approach to a variety of contentious issues of technology and society here in the US.

new technology barn storms into a an

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,309
economy and the government reaches out

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,050
to the citizens says what do you think

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,599
just an open-ended question what do you

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,120
think people can submit statements and

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,350
that's the qualitative layer and then

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,660
there's a quantitative layer where

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,550
people agree and disagree and pass on

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,570
statements submitted by others one way

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,449
to think about this is it's like a

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,800
survey that's created rather than by the

00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:28,050
agency it's a survey that's created by

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,420
people who are taking it so the

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,980
population itself creates dimensions on

00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,579
which they're scoring themselves and

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,370
this creates a matrix of every statement

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,219
that's been submitted by every person

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,260
who's participating and that's not a

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,170
very interesting data structure to

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,940
humans to have a 200 comments by six

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,250
thousand people is not particularly

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,020
interesting to it's not particularly

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,600
digestible the number of permutations

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,860
for humans but machine learning the

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,559
machine learning tool chain knows what

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,590
to do with big matrices and so we take

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,690
that information and we create opinion

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,700
groups and we visualize camps and tribes

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,840
and opinion groups and there are a

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,400
number of things you can do you can just

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,720
simply report that back in a more

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,360
private way if you're on the enterprise

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,979
side but if you're in the participatory

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,780
democracy side one thing that you can do

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,330
is you can visualize it and so that's

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,310
kind of our core the core technology

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,110
that we've been building to date and so

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,850
visualizing opinion groups is

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,400
interesting because you can show someone

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,829
how they fall relative to everyone else

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,720
so as people vote they move around in a

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,250
visualization towards people who voted

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,740
like they did and you can see the group

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,020
on the left here thinks uberx is

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,360
creating unfair competition and the

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,189
group on the right disagrees you can see

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,049
the group on the left also thinks that

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,700
uberx is not operating according to the

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,680
law so there are risks group on the

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,240
right disagrees group on the right on

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,979
the other hand thinks even if there's

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,950
taxis in the street I'm going to take an

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,390
uber group on the Left disagrees but

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,149
here's the magic the magic is that in

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,130
the context of opinion groups we can

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,329
also show consensus we can also show

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,619
something that both of these groups

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,329
agree on and there's very little

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,520
opportunity in our democracy or in our

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,680
public dialogue to say to someone who's

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,970
across the aisle yeah I deeply agree

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,780
with you on that point that's that's

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,280
something that we should move forward

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,640
and shared consensus that's not

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,770
something that's really it

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,140
emerging from from our from our

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,870
collective discussions to put it lightly

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,120
this week I think so here's something

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,890
that everyone got behind that regardless

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,240
of what we do with uber we should use

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,280
this as an opportunity to improve

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,780
quality across the board that's a very

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,100
interesting statement interesting

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,890
qualitative statement that you might not

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,959
get from just doing a survey but you you

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,310
can get with with AI by putting that out

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,260
there and it just turns out that

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,700
everyone agreed that this is a great

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,090
opportunity to improve quality across

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,090
