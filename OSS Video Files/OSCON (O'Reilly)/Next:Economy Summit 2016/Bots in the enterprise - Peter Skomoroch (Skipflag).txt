Description: 
	In a 21st-century business, more and more of your workers are going to be bots, and they will be helping you manage your company. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs building bot companies will demonstrate their bots and show you how you can use them to empower your staff.

now the real-world aí and aí taking over

00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,780
the world is pretty far off but you can

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,700
get a voice agent in your kitchen right

00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,210
now right so how many people have an

00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,400
Amazon Alexa okay it's it's really

00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,200
fascinating and it's this kind of

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,630
intimate thing Tim O'Reilly wrote this

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,890
great post what would Alexa do where he

00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,690
talks about some of the points of

00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:27,699
interacting with these conversational

00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:30,039
agents but it enables you to augment

00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:33,489
your workflow and to do things like set

00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,280
timers call an uber ask FAQs and

00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,420
Wikipedia things that you are doing in

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,489
ass in a safe zone where you can

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:44,050
interact with voice in your home now

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,960
that's interesting in the home or in a

00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,670
private setting but in the workplace how

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,739
we've been communicating is changing as

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,059
well so in the last five years we've

00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:55,989
seen this increasing shift towards

00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:57,699
messaging as a primary way that we

00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,679
communicate in the consumer world but

00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,499
also in the workplace how many people

00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,110
are using slack how many people are in

00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:05,560
slack right now okay that's a good

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,080
number

00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,060
so it's really interesting and it's not

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
all slack so email is still very

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,680
dominant and for external communication

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,130
and my own company we use email quite a

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,170
bit we use slack heavily internally but

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,560
really what you're seeing is this rise

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,690
of messaging within the enterprise and

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,130
it's it's it really just follows the

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,420
consumerization of the other enterprise

00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,870
software we've been seeing for a number

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:35,050
of years but the interesting thing is in

00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,360
a message what happened was we have this

00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:41,170
notion of her and bought like interfaces

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,610
happening via audio conversation and as

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,030
we move towards conversational

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,680
interfaces and software in the workplace

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,330
BOTS and a I have really been mapped

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,100
onto that so I think that's why we're

00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,230
seeing this bot explosion you've got

00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,480
advances in AI you have the rapid

00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,370
adoption and messaging and you have the

00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:01,240
sci-fi promise so all those things

00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:03,460
together give you this which is is

00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,409
pretty far off from the movie her but

00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,909
it's really interesting because it feels

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,750
like we're at the early days of the web

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:09,750
