Description: 
	When I ask companies to consider the big, hairy problems that need solving, I often think about the challenge of aging populations and the inverted demographic pyramid that will profoundly shape the future of the developed world. In Japan, they are experimenting with robots as companions to the elderly. Honor has a better idea: let’s just make it easier to vet and schedule real human caregivers for the elderly and those suffering from debilitating disease. While other entrepreneurs were going after “the Uber of drycleaning,” “the Uber of valet parking,” and other services that Twitter pundit Startup L. Jackson derides as “assisted living for the young,” Honor realized that modern technology could solve a real, vexing problem for those whose loved ones need special care.
