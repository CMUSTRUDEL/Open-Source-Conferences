Title: Aging with Honor: A conversation with Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins

Description: 
	When I ask companies to consider the big, hairy problems that need solving, I often think about the challenge of aging populations and the inverted demographic pyramid that will profoundly shape the future of the developed world. In Japan, they are experimenting with robots as companions to the elderly. Honor has a better idea: let’s just make it easier to vet and schedule real human caregivers for the elderly and those suffering from debilitating disease. While other entrepreneurs were going after “the Uber of drycleaning,” “the Uber of valet parking,” and other services that Twitter pundit Startup L. Jackson derides as “assisted living for the young,” Honor realized that modern technology could solve a real, vexing problem for those whose loved ones need special care.

well if the first thing you learn

00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,140
organizing a union is that people don't

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,809
join unions for wages and benefits

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,950
usually they join for respect they want

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,839
to be treated well they feel like

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,820
they've been in a system that didn't

00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,039
treat them well and so fundamentally for

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,650
us when we built honor it was to make

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,810
sure that care pros or caregivers were

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,390
respected so if you were working at a

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,910
traditional agency your schedule depends

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,130
on your relationship with a person doing

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,349
this scheduling so if you speak the same

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,780
language if you look like that person if

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,480
you bring them cake or ice cream and so

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,180
the first piece is making sure that you

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,030
can access the system regardless of your

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,559
connection or relationship to a human

00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,539
the second thing is the way that you get

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,149
rated right now in a lot of places you

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,219
get rated just by a consumer we

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:52,260
recognize there's implicit bias and so

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,109
making sure that the rating system is

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,090
also recognizes that it is not just

00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,579
consumer review but how skilled you are

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,680
what time you arrive how consistently

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,080
you use the app and so I think that's

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,700
been really important and let me never

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,950
say that wages and benefits are not

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,900
incredibly important and because we

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,790
recognize that most of the women who do

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,310
this work it is mostly women and people

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,830
of color mostly moms who are trying to

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,990
do it on their own and so part of what

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,810
the tech enables us to do is to charge

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,700
less and pay more and so when you look

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,620
at the starting wage it actually allows

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,630
people to be able to support their

00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,820
families and also recognize that people

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,460
need benefits and so for us it's

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,620
controlling your schedule making high

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,390
wages and benefits but also being able

00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,070
to make sure that the system is designed

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,440
not for a human to decide how you

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,150
succeed but for yourself to decide based

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,920
on your qualifications how you get paid

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,920
