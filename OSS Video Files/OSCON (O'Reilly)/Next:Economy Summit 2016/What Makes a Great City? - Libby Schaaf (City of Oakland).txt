Title: What Makes a Great City? - Libby Schaaf (City of Oakland)
Publication date: 2016-10-30
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Our special dinner guest will be Libby Schaaf, mayor of Oakland. As mayor, Libby has focused on forward-looking policies that have made Oakland one of the best places to live in the country. It’s a vibrant, multicultural city that is navigating the transition to becoming a tech hub. Uber is moving its headquarters to Oakland, as are other technology companies, and its easy access to San Francisco has made it a home of choice for many who work in San Francisco and points south. We’ll talk with Libby about Uber’s move. How is Oakland planning to navigate the forces of gentrification? How can the city welcome economic growth without pricing out long-time residents and the intense local flavor that makes Oakland so special? We’ll also talk with Libby about some of her key initiatives: Oakland Promise, an effort to triple the number of low-income Oakland residents who receive a college degree, her forward-looking Department of Transportation, which aims to develop policies to reshape transportation in the city in line with the possibilities of the 21st century, her affordable housing plan, and efforts to improve police-community relations.

you know there's this narrative in

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,850
Oakland and you know Oakland is a city

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,189
of protests of the social justice

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,179
movement there's a narrative that

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:15,660
capitalism is bad is evil and yet

00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:17,100
capitalism is run by human beings and I

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,619
believe that human beings are

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,960
intrinsically good when given the

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,890
opportunity to act through their values

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,330
when we look at corporate citizenship

00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,480
traditionally the model has been pretty

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,009
limited its philanthropy we're asking

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
companies to write a check to our

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,770
favorite charity or it's like a company

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,570
run volunteer program but what we are

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,550
trying to do is kind of redefine

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,850
corporate citizenship in Oakland and

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,329
look for where do we share values where

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,640
are our mutual needs and so over and

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,260
this is this is a success story and we

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,559
talked to over about things that we

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:58,109
think they need to they need a future

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,870
work force and frankly I think we've all

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,019
recognized that text will benefit from

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,299
having a more diverse work force one

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,630
that is also representative of its

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,360
customer base we have a lot of brilliant

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:16,170
very diverse kids in the city of Oakland

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,740
and so we invited maybe that's a strong

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,229
word

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,540
uber to participate more strongly in

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,060
creating that pipeline of future

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,330
students to become their future workers

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,159
we also invited them to think about how

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,530
they could participate in some non

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,780
traditional corporate citizenship ways

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,860
like thinking about their purchasing

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,590
decisions and and I have actually a good

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,570
success story to tell if there's one

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,939
thing software engineers need its coffee

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,390
because it's a really boring job

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:54,010
we need our engineers

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:57,140
I guess that hit home with a few people

00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,590
well any company's gonna need to keep

00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,260
their software engineers caffeinated and

00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,080
so rather than just assuming Hoover was

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,270
going to contract with you know whoever

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,610
we introduced them to a fantastic local

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,760
bean roasting company in Oakland called

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,890
red Bay coffee Red Bay coffee is was

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,070
started by an african-american

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,709
entrepreneur

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,200
it is a workers collective and it

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,470
employs almost exclusively formerly

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,050
incarcerated workers it is a really

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,790
great business and the good news is if

00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,040
coffee is unbelievable it's great and so

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,530
uber we introduced uber to this great

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,780
coffee company they not only like their

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,090
coffee so much that they committed to

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,010
use this coffee supplier in their

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,320
Oakland office they didn't want to wait

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,540
they entered into a contract right away

00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,090
to start supplying their to San

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,810
Francisco buildings with red bay coffee

00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,360
