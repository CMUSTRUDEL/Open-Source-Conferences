Publication date: 2016-10-30
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Our special dinner guest will be Libby Schaaf, mayor of Oakland. As mayor, Libby has focused on forward-looking policies that have made Oakland one of the best places to live in the country. It’s a vibrant, multicultural city that is navigating the transition to becoming a tech hub. Uber is moving its headquarters to Oakland, as are other technology companies, and its easy access to San Francisco has made it a home of choice for many who work in San Francisco and points south. We’ll talk with Libby about Uber’s move. How is Oakland planning to navigate the forces of gentrification? How can the city welcome economic growth without pricing out long-time residents and the intense local flavor that makes Oakland so special? We’ll also talk with Libby about some of her key initiatives: Oakland Promise, an effort to triple the number of low-income Oakland residents who receive a college degree, her forward-looking Department of Transportation, which aims to develop policies to reshape transportation in the city in line with the possibilities of the 21st century, her affordable housing plan, and efforts to improve police-community relations.
