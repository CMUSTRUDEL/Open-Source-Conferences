you've written a little bit on linkedin

00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:11,590
you know Anna media platform about the

00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:13,780
politics of anger we need to share your

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,980
thoughts on that like it's it's very

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,109
much related to what you were just

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,610
commenting on which is taking care of

00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:20,740
the people who are being displaced

00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,869
taking care of the less fortunate taking

00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,090
care of the disenfranchised because once

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,439
somebody becomes disenfranchised once

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,330
they feel like they no longer have a

00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,769
voice they're not being heard that's

00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,119
when bad things start to happen when

00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,429
people feel like there's nothing to lose

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,960
and you're seeing it you're not just

00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:36,159
seeing the United States you're seeing

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,199
it in Europe you've seen it all over the

00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,239
world right now people are angry there

00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:42,219
are large swathes of the population

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,249
within particular countries cities etc

00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:47,109
where people no longer feel like they

00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:50,530
have access to opportunity they don't

00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:52,299
feel like things are fair and even for

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,269
those was a recent survey that just came

00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:57,579
out recent data that was looking into

00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:59,739
why certain folks are supporting Trump

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:01,989
here in the US presidential election and

00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:03,459
many people had hypothesize it was folks

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:05,920
that were out of jobs and it turned out

00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:08,229
in certain cities those people had jobs

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,090
they were worried about their children

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,350
and they were worried about their

00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,030
children's children and they were

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,729
worried about opportunities in the

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,140
future so people need to feel like they

00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,299
have access to opportunity people need

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,670
to feel like they have some say in these

00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,710
outcomes and increasingly you can see it

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,060
with this anger people don't feel like

00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,070
that and what's happening very

00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,439
unfortunately is this wicked vicious

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,329
cycle where people are condemning

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,530
criticizing this anger and they're

00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:37,240
saying people are voting from a place of

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,679
emotion and not necessarily a place of

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,420
logic a reason and you saw it with the

00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:42,939
brexit vote that was a canonical example

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,229
of this where a lot of people rather

00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,840
than dig in a roll their sleeves and

00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:49,749
understand why people voted to leave and

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,130
why people felt like they didn't have a

00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:52,749
voice in they were disenfranchised do

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,490
you remember one of the most popular

00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:56,079
memes that was circulating after that

00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,329
vote with a number of people that had

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,539
gone on to google to ask about what

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:03,100
brexit was that had voted and everyone

00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,659
seemed to get a big kick out of this and

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,789
there's a lot of snark that was being

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:08,800
circulated and there are very very few

00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,330
people who are actually sitting down

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,239
with the folks that had voted to leave

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,830
to understand why and to understand what

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,120
misconceptions they may have had

00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,010
and where their anger was coming from

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,540
and unfortunately you see something very

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,760
similar happening in this country right

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,120
now with regard to supporters of either

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,100
Hillary or Donald Trump where there's a

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,360
lot of snark flying back and forth and

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,560
by snark I'm not even talking about the

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,910
voters I'm talking about people of

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,040
influence who are commenting and

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,770
observing all of this stuff and if we

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,480
took just a fraction of the snark and a

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,700
fraction of the contempt which by the

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,100
way is in flaming the people who are

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:44,140
angry to begin with and invested that

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,850
and understanding why people are so

00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,130
angry and what we can do about it

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:49,930
hopefully we get away from attacking the

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,050
people and we start attacking the

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,050
