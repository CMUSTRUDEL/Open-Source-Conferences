Title: On-demand drone delivery for blood and medicine - Keller Rinaudo (Zipline)
Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	While Amazon and Google are experimenting with drone delivery so rich consumers can get their latest purchases delivered to their door, Keller Rinaudo had a better idea. Let’s put on-demand technology and drones to work solving a real problem: delivering blood and critical medicines in settings where there is no widespread medical infrastructure and poor transportation. We’ll have a look at the technology Keller’s company Zipline is deploying today in Rwanda.

	00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,040
it was fantastic today we made the first

00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:09,290
delivery to a hospital here in Rwanda I

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,150
think anywhere in the world and we also

00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,179
made the first delivery of blood by a

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,620
drone anywhere in the world so I so far

00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,720
so good we're going to be basically

00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,430
starting today the system is now

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,160
operational and so we'll be doing

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,930
operational flights starting with just a

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,910
few hospitals and then expanding to 21

00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,400
hospitals across the western half of

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,230
Rwanda over the next month it's

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,899
fantastic I understand you're also

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,859
planning some pilots in the US yeah you

00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,229
know it's funny I think a lot of people

00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,359
often think that countries in Africa are

00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:43,429
playing catch-up to countries like the

00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,829
US but this is an instance where the

00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:47,539
u.s. is well moving a little slow shall

00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:49,010
we say from a regulatory perspective and

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,749
actually the White House looked at the

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,569
work that Rwanda was doing in terms of

00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:54,499
showing how drones can save lives and

00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:56,539
approached us and said that they wanted

00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:58,850
us to do the same thing in the u.s. yeah

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,949
can you i read somewhere just how

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,709
serious a problem postpartum hemorrhage

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,000
is in rwanda can you talk a little bit

00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:08,390
about that just two people understand

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,560
the scale of the problem and and one of

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,899
the most important things I can

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,670
emphasize is it's not just Rwanda this

00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:15,710
is actually a problem everywhere in the

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,700
world including in the US but to use

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,859
Rwanda as an example we want to deliver

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,170
65,000 units of blood a year fifty

00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:25,250
percent of that is being used for moms

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,619
who are suffering from postpartum

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,149
hemorrhaging and then thirty percent is

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,039
going toward children under the age of

00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:33,259
five or suffering from severe anemia due

00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:35,570
to malaria so eighty percent of the

00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:38,840
blood that you're delivering is urgently

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,420
needed and saving a life and yet it's

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,249
very expensive and hard to stalk and it

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,499
has a very short shelf life so you can't

00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:48,130
stock a lot of blood ahead of time using

00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:48,130
