Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Science fiction has long posited a future of material abundance enabled by technology and a human economy built on creativity, reputation, and status. We may already be seeing signs of that science fiction economy. James Nord of Fohr Card shows us how the reputation gained through social media gets traded or converted into cold, hard cash.

	00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:05,799
you have this group of people who can

00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,779
live a lifestyle you know in in the past

00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:09,340
if you wanted to have that lifestyle if

00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:11,290
you want to defy private and stay at the

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,629
nicest hotels in the world you would

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,860
have to enter a career that would allow

00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:16,540
you to do that and you'd have to build

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,880
up your wealth over years and years and

00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,380
years these people are using influence

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,180
instead of money to purchase those

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,220
things essentially and they're making

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,170
their money off the brands that maybe

00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,359
they don't like as much you know so on

00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,400
lawns maybe not paying someone to stay

00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:33,130
in their hotel but old navys giving that

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,690
same person $20,000 for an Instagram so

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,730
it's really interesting the way that

00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,200
it's changing because it's not just like

00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,330
you do a certain amount of work and you

00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,050
get money you either get money or you

00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,050
