Title: The Human Company Manifesto - Sara Holoubek (Luminary Labs)
Publication date: 2016-10-28
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The more I look at our economy and many of the companies that drive it, the more I see a machine with a bad design, one that shouts, “Humans don’t really matter.” That’s why I subtitled this year’s conference “Technology and business as if people matter.” We have to stop thinking about people working for companies and start making companies work for people. Sara Holoubek and I are clearly thinking along similar lines. Her Human Company Manifesto is one of the seminal documents of the Next Economy. She’ll outline its key tenets.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
so let's go back to the future of work

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,720
right it's not about the technology we

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,150
know it has something to do with humans

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,170
maybe it's actually about business

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,240
design and so two years ago at my

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,510
company we had a team member who

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,279
suffered a horrific loss we were a very

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,650
female-friendly company we're a very

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,539
family friendly company but I decided

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,099
that that was not enough we actually

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,960
needed to be a more human company and

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,599
help this person through this situation

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,180
and so we made a lot of changes and how

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,980
we operated how we worked when we worked

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,010
how we engage with clients who we hired

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,000
what we expected and right around that

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,010
time we started to see some really

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,920
interesting headlines so this is like

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,399
January 2015 Aetna increases minimum

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,039
wage to sixteen dollars and bertolini

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,410
sends a message to the street he's like

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,789
you know what this isn't really just

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,199
because it's the right thing to do it is

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,260
the right thing to do but we're actually

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,539
have a better financial result for it we

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,399
saw Vodafone backed by a study from KPMG

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,320
that said if companies offered family

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,299
leave they would actually save 19

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,150
billion dollars worldwide vodafone has

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,950
family leave now marc benioff whoa

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,950
Salesforce famously pulls out of Indiana

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,509
and protest of discrimination pinterest

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,189
decides that they're going to extend the

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,720
time frame that you can have as an

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,390
employee to exercise your options to

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,130
seven years and small companies start

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,869
saying maybe we're not losing talent to

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,250
Google because it's google but because

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,619
they actually have better benefits and

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,700
are investing in their people and so the

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,100
question about like whether we're

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,350
investing in foosball or family leave I

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,939
mean this isn't about warm fuzzies this

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,310
is about cold hard cash it's how you

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,530
spend your money it's a decision a

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,509
financial decision but one that dictates

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,000
who will work for you your company and

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,159
your industry in the future in the long

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,439
run so we were really excited by this

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,360
all these examples of large companies we

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,890
were doing things differently but like

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,229
how could we find out more and the

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,570
problem was there was no playbook and so

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,090
we wrote one and we curated examples

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,969
from early-stage companies and for

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,040
general assembly pinterest the muse

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,320
examples of actual policies that

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,360
invested in people and we publish us a

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,569
year ago and realize that we hit a nerve

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,870
we started hearing from larger private

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,940
sector companies and even

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,250
companies asking us if we had other

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,519
examples and it occurred to us that

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,370
maybe human company design isn't really

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,040
just about policies maybe we're at the

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,349
beginning of a sea change where major

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,569
corporations are rethinking radically

00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,360
rethinking how they design their

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,069
businesses to create value and is

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,079
through what we call human company

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,549
design a management approach that

00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,709
creates value by investing in people

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:44,129
this is the antithesis of extracting

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,129
