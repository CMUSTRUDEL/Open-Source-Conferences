Title: Is it time for a universal basic income? - Andrew Stern (Columbia University)
Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	When one of the most successful labor leaders of the modern era resigns his job to work on what at first seems a radical new notion—universal basic income (UBI)—it highlights just how deeply our economy is changing. When he’s joined in that quest by Y Combinator, one of the wellsprings of Silicon Valley entrepreneurship, things get even more interesting. Natalie Foster of the Aspen Institute hosts a conversation with Andy Stern, author of the new book Raising the Floor, and Elizabeth Rhodes, who is heading up Y Combinator’s new universal basic income experiments. We’ll get a chance to hear how the quintessential Silicon Valley take on UBI—driven by data and experiments, not political action—comes together with the labor activism of Andy Stern to rethink the social safety net for the 21st century.

so I'd say the change is inevitable it's

00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:08,269
progress that's optional and politics

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,220
matters this is not just a matter of

00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:12,230
policy it's a matter of politics and I

00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,360
think we saw on the stage last night's

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,160
debate you know when people are anxious

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,990
and people are unhappy there are lots of

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,460
different alternatives and that the

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,770
people in this room all of us are going

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,289
to write the next big chapter in

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,930
economic and social and cultural history

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,340
about what does a world look like when

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,500
there's a significantly different

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,569
structure of work and amount of work to

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,339
be done and it can look like The Hunger

00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:37,100
Games or it could be looked like that

00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:39,319
the top part of Maslow's need hierarchy

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,629
and this is where organizing does matter

00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:43,940
it's where advocacy matters it where is

00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,679
where politics matters so nothing is

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,229
inevitable here but I think the

00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:49,399
opportunity is a once-in-a-lifetime

00:00:47,229 --> 00:00:51,739
opportunity to move up that needs

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,210
hierarchy and to actually give people

00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,949
the kind of choices they've never seen

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:58,210
before in the history of the world but

00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:58,210
