Title: A conversation with David Kenny, general manager at IBM Watson

Description: 
	There’s been a predictable pattern in AI news: machine beats human—a computer demonstrating a skill that was once thought to be impossible for an AI. In IBM Watson’s case, it was first a game of chess, then Jeopardy. Since then, Watson has turned to more prosaic pursuits: helping doctors with diagnoses, insurance companies with customer service, accountants with auditing, and lawyers with legal research. And in each of these cases, it is an assistant—a powerful assistant, but an assistant nonetheless—not an opponent.

	00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,319
you took over Watson in January what has

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,999
most delighted and surprised you about

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,480
the work that you've seen and

00:00:08,999 --> 00:00:14,070
participated in this year yeah I would

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,869
say when people are trying to use Watson

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,140
in the real world or solving problems so

00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:21,599
in August the University of Tokyo had an

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,999
instance of wasn't for oncology they

00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:25,109
used that to read six-year-old woman's

00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:26,640
medical records

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,349
I've she had a very rare form of

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,869
leukemia but because the system was

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,250
built on a lot of prior data including

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,890
every patient ever at Memorial

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,989
sloan-kettering they found in ten

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,539
minutes what they had not solved in six

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,699
years and she's better and I just think

00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:45,809
they the chance to actually extend life

00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:48,570
to bring computing power to these real

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,250
everyday decisions matters and and when

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,359
you broaden out the medical cuz like

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,769
you've done some great thing in

00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,370
radiology and everything else what do

00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:58,649
you see is the trends for how you know

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,789
improvement in medicine is happening you

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,510
know what does that also mean because

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,940
we're thinking about what the future

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,220
work is how does that how does that work

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,280
in medical and improving at work what do

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,050
you see is the future of that yes so

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,130
whether medical or law which we just saw

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,000
we're doing a lot a lot of that

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,100
accounting Watson's greater rules

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,170
basically what we're at a mating is sort

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,480
of the base level rote work and that

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,990
frees up time and capacity to solve

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,420
bigger problems and to actually be more

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,680
clear what's on solve so you can find in

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,050
the patterns of leukemia what we don't

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,450
know and that'll help researchers find

00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,970
solutions in my prior work and weather

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,890
which got me here in climate models you

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,540
see that what we don't understand we

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,620
understand the atmosphere very well we

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,720
don't understand what's happened to the

00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,920
oceans so you can be more precise what

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,510
we need to know you could put an

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,460
economic value on it and you can create

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,260
jobs to get the information we need

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,310
there's a better in the oceans which

00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,710
will help us solve climate change

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,270
basically it's shift the work for

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,500
symbiosis because you say well once we

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,240
have this covered we can actually

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,650
generate all this work which actually

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,030
make the whole system better right in

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,980
the in the world still has a lot of

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,810
unsolved problems so for me I think

00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,820
freeing human capacity to solve hard

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,039
problems is what all this is going to do

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,289
one of the things I was trying to prompt

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,620
you with on the medical side is a

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,400
conversation you know I've had is is the

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,189
time

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,439
and the doctors over rule the radiology

00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:21,239
and kind of what you've learned from

00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,769
that and I think that's worth you know

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,790
kind of when people understand the

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:29,069
current progress of AI yes it's a you

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:32,040
know we there was a the head of the

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,439
oncology department at UNC was on 60

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,560
minutes Sunday talking about Watson and

00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:40,290
he gave his statistic which is they test

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,099
a diagnosis 30% of the Watson diagnoses

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:47,069
had not been found by humans so it

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,810
opened new doors and new answers for one

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,799
thing I would say secondly we do find

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,569
that the machines do over time come to

00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,370
better predictions so I know in whether

00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,139
for example that seventy percent the

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,180
time that the meteorologist overrides

00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,579
the system they make the forecast worse

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,099
and we see similar statistics whether it

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:09,510
be you know radiology or law or

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:12,269
accounting it's just that a system can

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,709
be unbiased and it has more knowledge so

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,709
