Publication date: 2016-10-27
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The Information has become one of the most read publications by Silicon Valley insiders. Its trenchant reporting and insights help everyone see the future more clearly. But Jessica wants to talk with us about her business model. She doesn’t want to exit. She’s not playing the financial game of the serial entrepreneur. She wants to build a business that lasts. If you’ve followed what Bryce Roberts and I are doing with Indie.vc, you understand that she is a role model for leaders of a whole new class of company that is pointing the way toward a more sustainable economy.
