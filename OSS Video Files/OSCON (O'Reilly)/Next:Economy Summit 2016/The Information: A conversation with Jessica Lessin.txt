Title: The Information: A conversation with Jessica Lessin
Publication date: 2016-10-27
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The Information has become one of the most read publications by Silicon Valley insiders. Its trenchant reporting and insights help everyone see the future more clearly. But Jessica wants to talk with us about her business model. She doesn’t want to exit. She’s not playing the financial game of the serial entrepreneur. She wants to build a business that lasts. If you’ve followed what Bryce Roberts and I are doing with Indie.vc, you understand that she is a role model for leaders of a whole new class of company that is pointing the way toward a more sustainable economy.

you come from a fairly traditional media

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:09,360
journalism background why are you making

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,099
such waves so it's the business model I

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,630
mean the thing I was trying to do when i

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,240
started the information about three

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,180
years ago was i don't think the news

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,920
business is broken I don't think

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,369
reporting is broken I think the news

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,890
business is broken I think that the vast

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,359
majority of organizations have decided

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,970
they're chasing traffic and pageviews

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,130
and this made absolutely no sense to me

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,559
because that model is bad for business

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,140
it just doesn't pay the bills and it's

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,140
bad for journalism you get 19 versions

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,079
of whatever stories trending and nothing

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,850
original so I think my background as a

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,890
reporter at The Wall Street Journal for

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,289
eight years covering a lot of the big

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,360
tech companies in Silicon Valley sort of

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,399
made me realize that that is the

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,649
competitive advantage all media

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,539
companies have it's not playing the

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,190
traffic game is playing the content game

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,020
and so how is that worked out what have

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,480
been some of those counterintuitive bets

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,970
you made initially that are starting to

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,409
pay dividends now surcharging four

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,450
hundred dollars a year was certainly

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,229
something business insider said would

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,450
never work or many others as well you

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,580
know where cash flow positive our

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,530
subscriber base more than doubled in the

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,189
last year alone and we have 19 full-time

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,950
employees including 10 reporters offices

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,070
in New York and Hong Kong so in San

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,079
Francisco so our business is working and

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,689
it's because we made that bet it's

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,509
because we said we're not going to write

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,970
the news of the day we're not going to

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,229
write for a Today Show sized audience

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,150
we're going to write for the

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,710
decision-makers and tech media and

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,110
finance and we're going to hold

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,240
ourselves to the bar of writing content

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,040
that's worth paying for would you say

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,200
how would you grade yourself on

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,500
delivering on that promise so far I

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,619
should ask you um no I mean I think I

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,659
can say only what our growth and subs

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,430
you know what the feedback we got from

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,619
subscribers and the numbers are and I I

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,259
think we're living up to it but we can

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,720
always improve I think there are areas

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,330
where we can add even more value

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,150
significantly particular if you look at

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,549
the

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,110
information needs of people in like the

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:20,200
finance community or where it's a little

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,349
more specialized and I think our team is

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,530
always trying to raise the bar even as

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:29,079
our staff has grown we've stuck just two

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,569
stories a day and what that's allowed us

00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:34,319
to do is make those stories as good as

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,319
