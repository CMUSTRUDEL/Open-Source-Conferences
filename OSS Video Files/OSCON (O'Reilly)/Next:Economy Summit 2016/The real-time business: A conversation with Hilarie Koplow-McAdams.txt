Title: The real-time business: A conversation with Hilarie Koplow-McAdams
Publication date: 2016-10-28
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Silicon Valley companies have traditionally performed so well because their products are instrumented. Within every application is a second application that measures what works, gives developers insight into how customers are responding, and helps the company adjust its product or service in close to real time. Today, as technology infuses real-world products and services, this kind of capability is required of every business. New Relic has been a leader in building the data-driven infrastructure for application monitoring; they are now providing monitoring and decision services for entire businesses. Weâ€™ll talk with New Relic president Hilarie Koplow-McAdams about data-driven business and why, as Hilarie likes to say, data is a team sport.

the one characteristic that we've seen

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,549
across companies that make them

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,740
effective or ineffective at its

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,679
transformation of the workflows as you

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,990
said is how they share information if

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,199
it's a traditional organization and they

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,970
think in silos my job is to make sure

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,760
that the application is up and running

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,680
my job is to develop an application my

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,350
job is to push a marketing program and

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,890
they don't share the data across then

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,269
it's a very old experience but in

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,820
organizations where they share the data

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,010
and create this digital nervous system

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,050
that you referenced it's amazing well

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,629
you know I was about to ask you about

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,820
one of your sayings which is data is a

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,530
team sport right leading right up to

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,480
that so can you maybe talk just a little

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,300
bit about that yes so from our

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,440
perspective the best run organizations

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,449
when they think about the digital

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,640
experiences first of all they recognize

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,620
that that digital experience is a brand

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,690
experience it really creates impressions

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,989
of and it creates loyalty or lack

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,229
thereof and that everybody needs to be

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,119
informed and one of the I remember

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,210
having this insight when I went to visit

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,790
an airline company that specializes in

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,850
sort of short trips vacation planning so

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,759
it's a last-minute booking and they try

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,939
to engage their customers on a mobile

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,220
app so this is a pretty high bar to plan

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,299
a short vacation on a mobile application

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:31,049
and what they figured out was that if I

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,259
could find a flight a hotel and a car to

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,920
rent you can hear my Boston accent a car

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,869
to rent and i can successfully do that

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,640
on my mobile application that they had n

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,030
number of tickets booked per minute and

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,220
anytime that number dropped below that

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,009
benchmark they were probably having a

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,930
performance issue with a gateway you

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,229
know a payment gateway or with one of

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,210
the hotel gateways or they had to do

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,280
promotion management and if you think

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,490
about how this was done 10 or 15 years

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,700
ago much more programmatic not in real

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,920
time much worth long-term approach just

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,750
changes the way every single individual

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,150
behaves in this company so when you walk

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,930
around this airline all around the

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,879
corporate offices they have a dash

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,549
board in the center of the dashboard is

00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,980
tickets booked per minute and around the

00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:23,500
peripheral of that are all the services

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,540
that engage consumers in that ticketing

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,150
and planning process I think that's a

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,829
wonderful example of a company that's

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,180
gone through a revolution in terms of

00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:33,870
how they think about how they service

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,870
