Description: 
	Silicon Valley companies have traditionally performed so well because their products are instrumented. Within every application is a second application that measures what works, gives developers insight into how customers are responding, and helps the company adjust its product or service in close to real time. Today, as technology infuses real-world products and services, this kind of capability is required of every business. New Relic has been a leader in building the data-driven infrastructure for application monitoring; they are now providing monitoring and decision services for entire businesses. Weâ€™ll talk with New Relic president Hilarie Koplow-McAdams about data-driven business and why, as Hilarie likes to say, data is a team sport.
