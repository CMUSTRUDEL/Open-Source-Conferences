Title: Makers and Takers: A conversation with Rana Foroohar
Publication date: 2016-10-14
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	When we look at the causes of growing income inequality and the loss of good middle-class jobs, it’s become fashionable to blame the march of technology. Rana Foroohar, Time magazine’s assistant managing editor, columnist, and author of the new book Makers and Takers, has a different diagnosis: the fundamental incentive structures of our financial system. CEOs are rewarded for short-term gains in stock price rather than long-term productive reinvestment. The net result is that companies too often treat workers as a cost to be eliminated rather than an asset to be harnessed to new uses. We’ll talk with Rana about what she calls “the rise of finance and the decline of American business.”

	00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:05,560
the thing that really interested me was

00:00:02,739 --> 00:00:07,330
the contention points the pressure

00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,860
points between finance and business and

00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,580
a lot of times when you talk about this

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,960
issue the bank bailouts inequality the

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,320
slow growth economy in the wake of the

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,449
crises it's poised as a finance versus

00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,490
society issue but actually this idea

00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,869
that the financial system which is the

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,960
center of the system of modern

00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:28,570
capitalism it's pushing business to do

00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,740
the wrong things is it's kind of new and

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,920
I think people are still getting their

00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,320
their their brains around that that all

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,180
stems from from a fundamental change in

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,399
the business model of the financial

00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,500
system and then I'm gonna come okay to

00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,630
shareholder value because what you have

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,379
to understand first is seventy or sorry

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,360
forty years ago the financial system

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,370
mostly did lending mostly did lending to

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
business so if you go back to the 1970s

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,360
about sixty percent of all the money

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
coming out of the big US institutions

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,960
would have been going into businesses

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,960
you know started by people like you or

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,469
people out here or small businesses all

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,539
kinds of businesses today only 15% of

00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:10,209
the money from US financial institutions

00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:12,369
actually makes its way into business the

00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,139
rest of it is the trading of assets the

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:16,959
buying and selling of securities stocks

00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:19,779
bonds houses so that's a fundamental

00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,849
business model shift and then you couple

00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,229
that with the changes in that you're

00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,149
talking about in the way corporations

00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,319
are governed and run and I point to two

00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:29,729
things in my book that I think were

00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,539
really seminal share buybacks which

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,939
everybody knows have reached record

00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:36,130
levels in recent years were illegal

00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:38,649
before 1982 they were considered market

00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,689
manipulation that changed under Ronald

00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:43,239
Reagan so you can look at that share

00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:44,649
buybacks take off and then under the

00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:46,209
Clinton administration Bill Clinton's

00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:48,310
administration there were changes in the

00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,590
way corporate compensation for

00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,289
performance pay could be awarded in in

00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,659
stock options that was under under Bob

00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:58,149
Rubens reign as Treasury secretary and

00:01:55,659 --> 00:02:00,340
then you saw buybacks take off again

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,829
now what was happening is you had an

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,209
incentive structure pushed by Wall

00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,069
Street which always wants the share

00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:07,929
price to go up for the quarter that

00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:10,060
basically incentivized leaders to do not

00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:11,379
what was right for five 10 20 years but

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,240
what was right for the quarter what's

00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,130
right to get the stock price up this

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,470
and it just creates an incredibly

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:20,340
dysfunctional snowball cycle you know

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,340
