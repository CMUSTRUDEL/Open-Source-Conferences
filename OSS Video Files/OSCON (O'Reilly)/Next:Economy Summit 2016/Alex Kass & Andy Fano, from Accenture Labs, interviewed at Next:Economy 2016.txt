hi this is Mike Hendrickson from next

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,690
economy in San Francisco I'm here with

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,790
Alex and Andy from accenture children

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,740
how you doing hi that's the thing thanks

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,650
Rob so you guys are with essential apps

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,720
can you talk a little bit about what the

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:22,230
labs do sure because that started we're

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,039
about 200 people globally in within etc

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,320
and we are technology experts obviously

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,960
located here in Silicon Andy and I are

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,219
located in Silicon Valley and our job is

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,460
to basically help accenture move to the

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,460
new with technology to incubate new ways

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,110
for accenture to use technology to have

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,300
to change the way we deliver to clients

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,270
and also to incubate new offerings that

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,550
we bring to clients ok so move to the

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,340
new the new technology the new economy

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,410
the next economy what do you guys what

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,520
do you guys seen on your road map in the

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:02,250
labs I think all of those yeah yeah no

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,379
for example either when we look at

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,750
crowdsourcing or when my field is in

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,030
artificial intelligence the focus for us

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,890
is to look at the emerging technologies

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,409
understand their capabilities and then

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,600
build prototypes that demonstrate the

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,030
business potential for our clients so

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,720
for example what does machine learning

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,740
say mean for insurance or mean for

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,939
financial services for the way we

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,770
develop products and then we look at how

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:30,479
that's going to impact the way we

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,920
provide those services to our clients

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,780
and do you see certain industry sectors

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,470
trying to transition or transform

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,560
themselves more quickly than others are

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,490
there any industries that you see moving

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,490
quicker than other ones

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,270
well they're definitely areas that are

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,780
getting more attention so for example

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:59,380
right now you see a lot of focus on

00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,450
digital assistants and on the consumer

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,159
side it's in the area of things like a

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,170
Lex and so forth and you're seeing

00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:06,550
companies giving a lot of thought to

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,090
have that's going to be applied to

00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:13,870
customer service but in practice AI has

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,270
been applied for a long time now to a

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,300
very wide range of areas so everything

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,459
from for example how you do network

00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,580
optimization for supply chains has been

00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:28,019
making use of AI how you recommend the

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,850
product has been making use of AI

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:33,040
diagnosis in health care and quality

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:37,330
assurance has been making use of AI so

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,850
it really it pays to not just look at

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:43,000
where the shiny object is right now but

00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:44,230
to think more broadly about all of the

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,790
different business functions and

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,100
industries that can make use of it I

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:51,130
think one way to look at the question of

00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,410
it's not so much about which industries

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,970
are moving more quickly as much as which

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,230
industries map to which kinds of

00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,200
technologies in which kinds of

00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,450
transformations so my focus is on the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,250
future of work in and and how the

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,700
digital workforce is going to be

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:10,420
different than than than the way old

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,190
school work was done and we see at least

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,079
three different kinds of things

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,750
happening one is the use of

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:19,299
crowdsourcing in online labour markets

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,859
both inside the enterprise that across

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,280
the enterprise boundary to get the best

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:27,430
talent working on each project and

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,010
problem that is that technology is being

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,510
applied most to digital work so if

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,579
you're thinking about you know workers

00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,900
in the field that that's harder to do

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:37,030
through crowdsourcing is get to

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,760
physically move people on the other hand

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,560
if you if you're thinking about

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,150
artificial intelligence that often is

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,489
about transforming the entire work

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,230
process with new insights that allow the

00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,600
enterprise to predict what's going to

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,250
trust so that that that I think is more

00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,269
broadly applicable and then and then the

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,810
other thing that we're really interested

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:57,610
in is augmenting the worker with new

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,980
sort of superpowers with things like

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,200
augmented reality virtual reality and

00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,780
that applies to

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,819
factory work into physical work into

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,620
things where you're going to change the

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,420
way that the worker perceives their

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,390
physical environment to allow them to

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,879
learn more quickly adapt to new to

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,980
changes in configurations more precisely

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,470
and so forth so different industries

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,180
have different technologies that are

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,550
allowing them to rethink the way they do

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,860
were so as we transition to this new

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,370
economy and and we look at like the

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,010
worker being augmented or changed or the

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,810
role of their participation is different

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,419
is that a scary thing for a lot of

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,360
people well so so there's often this

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:42,389
view that AI is going to come in and

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,360
replace people and the thing is if we

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,840
take a step back and we look at what AI

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,610
actually is and what people do it turns

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,950
out that yes there's some overlap in

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,050
those capabilities but in practice ai

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,780
and technology tends to be good at

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,430
things that people are not as good at

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,710
and vice versa so let me make it a

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,110
little bit more concrete people are

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,380
really good about thinking deeply about

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,820
a small number of things and AI or

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,919
computers are good at the reverse

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,200
they're very good at shallow reasoning

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,220
about a very large number of things and

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,350
so given those two capabilities now as a

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,690
consulting company it's up to us to

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,200
craft solutions craft offerings that

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,639
take the best from both so what does

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,370
that mean in practice take something

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,110
like fraud detection okay a credit card

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,330
fraud without it takes an AI system to

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,880
flag a transaction and say in real time

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,500
and say this might be fraudulent no it

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,510
would have been impossible to do that in

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,789
real time with people but now that it's

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,010
been flagged it takes a person to follow

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,289
up and verify hey is this really a

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,270
fraudulent case or not you in Amsterdam

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,220
an odd yeah right it have that

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,229
conversation with with the with the

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,050
customer so that's an example where

00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,150
actually jobs are being created because

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,340
we've redefined the process that was a

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,070
process that didn't exist until a I came

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,260
along and so so really the way we have

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,150
to think about this is not so much the

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,880
process day is the same and now we're

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,900
replacing people with technology it's we

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,000
have AI is a tool

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,729
like any other tool it's going to play a

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,680
small role in a larger solution but how

00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,960
do we reimagine that solution to make

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,960
the entire process product or service

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,000
better so in go ahead no I just wanted

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,340
to sort of add to it and he's saying a

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,820
little more broadly when we think about

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,770
the changes let's say that a liquid

00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,850
workforce that's term we use an

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:41,669
extension of liquid workforce meaning

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:46,300
making the workforce much more agile

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:48,280
being able to match through say online

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,490
labor markets operating in the

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,039
organization max task owners to talent

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,840
owners wherever the talent is whether

00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,490
it's inside the organization or even

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,590
outside the organization that's it

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,180
that's a big change and so you asked is

00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,330
that scary well any change is scary

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:07,599
right but we see a lot of opportunity

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,830
that's really great for the organization

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,440
and also for the workers for the

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,020
organization what we see is it meaning

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,550
agility the ability that adapt to

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,620
changes in the market much more quickly

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,479
to make sure you get the best thinking

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,340
on every project and problem to the

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,849
worker it means a great deal more

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:28,479
flexibility ability to sort of focus on

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:31,449
work that matters for your career and

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,099
not just what your team happens to need

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,169
to get done so I want a world where

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,430
workers will spend most of their time

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:39,070
doing things that they're passionate

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:41,710
about that fit their aspirations and

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,080
then fit their skills and and and not

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,389
just sort of be stuck in one silo where

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,479
they have to apply their skills in one

00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,940
place whether it matches or not so I i

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,639
think in JFK I was just traveling

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,460
through JFK and I think you guys have a

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,870
sign that says change is good

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,220
transformation is imperative or

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,669
something I don't know if it was

00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,169
imperative but can you talk about how we

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:13,300
as as companies all throughout the world

00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:16,060
understand change happens the

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,639
transformations a bigger hairier thing

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,949
to do what do you see with your

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,380
customers in their transformation

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,479
journey are they are they turning their

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,930
ship upside down are they steering in a

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,240
different

00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,030
action what what do you guys see with

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,380
transformation more than change well

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,719
people are at different stages of

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:40,899
maturity different clients are thinking

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:44,680
about this in a range of ways if you

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:48,220
think about what's going on as a change

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,110
in our ability to compartmentalize work

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,270
for example and include different

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:54,190
workers and get different contributions

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:58,600
from different workers and on the

00:08:54,190 --> 00:09:00,820
technology side how we apply how we

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,310
capture and apply knowledge and a useful

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,350
and industrialized way that's a lot of

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,260
the question that's maybe the most

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,660
succinctly I have of posing what the

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,060
transformation has to be it's thinking

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,010
through given improvements in the way

00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:18,270
that we can include the labor

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:22,360
contributions of different people and

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:25,870
capture and exploit industry knowledge

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,510
to solve problems how we make the best

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,970
use of that is what the transformation

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,800
that's coming is all about and in

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,779
practice yes different industries

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,900
different individual companies are going

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,580
to do that at a different pace I think

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,350
you know it's very hard to you a

00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,790
one-size-fits-all answer to that

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,010
question yeah yeah and so let me give

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,620
you a couple of examples right in some

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,839
cases these techniques are just really

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,910
dramatically changing what products and

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,830
services you can offer and the whole

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,410
structure of who works for whom at uber

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,209
would be one example right where it just

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,750
turned an industry inside out and that's

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:04,240
happening but I think it's also quite

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,220
common that what's happening is more

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,860
subtle and in some ways I think maybe a

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,620
bigger impact where it's not so much

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,450
that you may need you necessarily see a

00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,180
new product it's that you're going to

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:18,850
see product lifecycles shorten you're

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,779
going to see quality go up you're going

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,610
to see you're going to see more engaged

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,920
workers for it since you're going to see

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,050
more flexibility in terms of how people

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,520
are going to be at what kinds of

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:33,579
relationships workers have with

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,920
organizations so in some cases is

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,959
changing how we do what we do and it's

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
in other cases it's completely changing

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:41,810
what we do and

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,790
and you know we totally rethinking from

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,550
from top to bottom and I don't know how

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:49,250
to really generalize from that so

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,440
gentlemen if we have the same discussion

00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:55,850
let's say we sit down next year in San

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,760
Francisco the same time same place what

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,190
would you like to say has changed in

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,800
this next economy that we're all moving

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:07,190
towards what would you like to say has

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,470
changed in the industry for everyone and

00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:12,950
then what will change for accenture in

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:16,280
your role with that I'll take it start

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:21,170
at that good so i think i think when i

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:23,720
think of the liquid workforce change i I

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:27,320
think of it as first of all a world in

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,590
which the org chart plays a much smaller

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,990
role in determining how work is going to

00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,510
get done in an organization and it's an

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:39,440
organization that's able to form teams

00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:42,170
on demand that's able to create the

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,440
table less less about managing and more

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:47,660
about orchestrating and and

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,070
orchestrating ad-hoc teams that meet

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,880
whatever the market needs at a given

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:55,220
moment so agility flexibility and really

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,010
a focus on matching talent to where it's

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,020
needed well not the rigid hierarchies

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:04,130
that we've got seen in the past in terms

00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,040
of Accenture all but what I see is that

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:10,700
this new way of orchestrating a

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,070
workforce is is not simple and we need

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,420
as a company to become expert in it and

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,300
then to be able to help our clients

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,160
really be able to master the

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,980
technologies that are available to do it

00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,430
the processes the techniques and to just

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,700
be able to do it well yeah i would say

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:30,500
that when i look at our own capabilities

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,250
at eccentrics capabilities where we've

00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,920
if i may say typically excelled is a

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,550
deep understanding of our clients

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,370
industries as well as the ability to be

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,470
very efficient about how we get the most

00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,590
out of the best people and so when you

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,780
look at what's going on in crowdsourcing

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,750
this is challenging us to rethink how we

00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,850
use people

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,260
and I think we're doing a lot of good

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,810
work alex is leaving a lot of great work

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,440
in this space and then again on the flip

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,830
side on the AI side what this is

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,140
allowing us to do is really rethink how

00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,670
we capture and exploit industry

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,700
knowledge so what I would like to see a

00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,370
year from now is progress towards less

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,310
emphasis on the raw technology and more

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,080
on how we capture and exploit industry

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,390
knowledge and rethink the way we deliver

00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,920
that with our people I think that's

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,930
really that's really important what I

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,510
just want to amplify a little bit which

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:30,090
is I think the raw technology is still

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,680
level that many companies are at now

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:35,070
they're they're kind of dealing with the

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,840
wow factor I think going forward and

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,480
getting to your your interest in sort of

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,830
how does it play out in specific

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,020
industries I think we're more and more

00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,850
going to see sort of kits that combine

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,190
instead of some people saying hey I'm

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,990
interested not mented reality i'm

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,640
interested in crowdsourcing i'm

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,680
interested may I we're going to have to

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,360
start seeing kits that you can say hey I

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,370
want to change a particular kind of work

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,800
process here's the kit to do it that

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,500
combines these and it'll get a proven

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,390
way excellent will gentlemen we look

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,940
forward to that conversation next year

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,180
Jerry execute thank you thank you very

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,180
much

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,250
