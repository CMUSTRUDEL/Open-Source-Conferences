Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	There’s been a great deal of conversation about the tech industry’s role in gentrification, but I haven’t read anything as thoughtful as Douglas Rushkoff’s new book, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus. Rather than just lamenting the problem, Douglas outlines a way forward to a local, circular economy, where money stays in a community and helps us build a more human-centered society.
