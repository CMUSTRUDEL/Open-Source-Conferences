Title: Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: A conversation with Douglas Rushkoff
Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	There’s been a great deal of conversation about the tech industry’s role in gentrification, but I haven’t read anything as thoughtful as Douglas Rushkoff’s new book, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus. Rather than just lamenting the problem, Douglas outlines a way forward to a local, circular economy, where money stays in a community and helps us build a more human-centered society.

right well I mean obviously growth is

00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:07,629
fine if it's organic to your marketplace

00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:09,639
you know i'd rather sell 100 pizzas than

00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:11,860
one pizza you know if there's a certain

00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:13,660
point at which growth is a problem and

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,810
that's if you're growing simply to

00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,160
satisfy the needs of your debt structure

00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:21,640
you know to satisfy a sort of an

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,289
abstracted requirement to vc rather than

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,260
the requirement of your actual

00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:28,869
marketplace you end up at odds with your

00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,509
customers with your suppliers know if I

00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,780
mean the way to say it in in terms of

00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:36,430
cities really is that if if capital is

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,250
the only factor of production that you

00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,770
recognize now if you don't recognize you

00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,440
know your labor and your land which is

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,690
your places and your people um then you

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,090
end up sort of lopsided so I've seen

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:52,750
lots of young developers with great

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:55,060
ideas for apps that have maybe let's

00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,190
call it limited appeal maybe they can

00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,260
only make so much money like Twitter it

00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,670
seems can only make two billion dollars

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,310
a year right they're having trouble

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,220
breaking through that plateau but you

00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,500
know once you reach that limit do you

00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,870
have to pivot in order to grow to some

00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,010
other area or can you be that

00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,010
