Title: Will Bots Replace Lawyers? - Joshua Browder (DoNotPay)
Publication date: 2016-10-27
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The law is widely considered as society’s operating system. Despite its importance, over 80 percent of the legal needs of the poor are unmet.

The law relies on information and rules, something that technology is unsurprisingly good at handling. Over the past year, Joshua Browder has been working to replace exploitative lawyers—mainly the ones charging hundreds of dollars for copying and pasting documents—with chatbots. Josh will speak about whether his “robot lawyer,” which has fought nearly $5 million worth of parking tickets, greedy landlords, and homelessness, should worry those in the legal profession.

I kind of got into this whole topic by

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,970
accident when I turned 18 the driving

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,160
age in the UK I really was a terrible

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,730
driver and got a large number of parking

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,710
tickets after about the fourth ticket

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,690
my parents were fed up they told me I

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,020
was on my own and I had to pay for my

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,170
own fines but the problem was I couldn't

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,240
afford a lawyer and all to pay the fines

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,500
so I had to figure out ways to get the

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,570
tickets dismissed I true love of obscure

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,579
government documents looking for the top

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,760
reasons why these parking tickets should

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,250
be cancelled after some initial success

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,380
it wasn't long before all my family and

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,230
friends were asking for my help I

00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,430
quickly became the local parking guru of

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,450
my area but it quickly became obvious

00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,489
that instead of helping everyone

00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,829
individually I should create some sort

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,890
of automated system to help people on

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,449
mass when I spoke to some lawyers in

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,210
London about what they thought about the

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,159
idea of a lawyer robot some were more

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,850
polite than others but every single one

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,499
said it was silly and would never work

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,020
but thinking it would be a cool side

00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:17,219
project I decided to create a anyway and

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,020
name the bar do not pay it first ask the

00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,819
user a few questions about their parking

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,969
ticket to find out the legal defense

00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,409
such as a parking bay that's too small

00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:28,020
it then asked to find out the details

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,359
and then places these details in a

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,209
legally sound document which can be sent

00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,009
directly to the government now when I

00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,229
created this it was really just to

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,909
impress a few friends oh and I could

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,549
never have imagined that just six months

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,119
later do not pay would take the legal

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,909
world by storm in just under a year it

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,009
has successfully appealed over 180

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,929
thousand parking tickets saving

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,619
motorists an estimated five million

00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:57,450
dollars all of a sudden the same lawyers

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,289
that had rejected me we're now phoning

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,419
up offering to require the website all

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:05,459
of this made me realise that the idea of

00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:07,649
using bots to help people with automated

00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,500
legal issues is bigger than just parking

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,709
tickets I decided to expand to other

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,819
areas of the law I started by going

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,640
after the airline

00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:19,860
in Europe if your flight is delayed by

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,439
more than a couple hours you can claim

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,799
lots of compensation but lawyers were

00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,180
charging huge commissions to get this I

00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:29,459
thought that this was unfortunate

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,430
so incorporated this functionality into

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,290
my robot it is completely free because

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,739
unlike its human equivalent it doesn't

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,060
require a salary

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,739
unfortunately because I was helping

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,810
users with parking tickets and delayed

00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,810
flights they assumed I could help them

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,269
with everything users buyer

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,000
began contacting me asking for help with

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,650
repossessions and evictions I felt

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,150
particularly bad not being able to help

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,510
people with these issues especially

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,609
since they were being made homeless I

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:02,459
later land in the UK we had this really

00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:04,650
broken system instead of helping the

00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,780
homeless directly got the government in

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,090
the UK pays lawyers huge sums of money

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,829
to file an application on behalf of

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,780
someone which gets sent back to the

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,769
government this seemed like something

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,769
