Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The law is widely considered as society’s operating system. Despite its importance, over 80 percent of the legal needs of the poor are unmet.

The law relies on information and rules, something that technology is unsurprisingly good at handling. Over the past year, Joshua Browder has been working to replace exploitative lawyers—mainly the ones charging hundreds of dollars for copying and pasting documents—with chatbots. Josh will speak about whether his “robot lawyer,” which has fought nearly $5 million worth of parking tickets, greedy landlords, and homelessness, should worry those in the legal profession.
