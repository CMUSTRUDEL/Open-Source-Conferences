Title: Indie.vc: Rewriting the rules of Silicon Valley—A conversation with OATV partner Bryce Roberts
Publication date: 2016-10-27
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	In Silicon Valley, the expectation is go big or go home. Every company is shooting to raise capital, grow fast, “blitzscale,” and sell out. (OK, a few are shooting to stay in the game for the long haul, but far too few.) Bryce Roberts, my partner at O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, noticed another class of company that was being ignored: a company that may need a little money to get going but wants to build a business the old-fashioned way—for the long haul, profitable, cash-flow positive, and self-funded. We’ll talk with Bryce about why Silicon Valley venture capital needs a reboot and why Indie.vc-style startups may be more important to the economy than traditional Silicon Valley startups. As Candace Mitchell, founder of Indie.vc-funded startup Myavana puts it: “Before Indie.vc, I was focused on raising a million dollars. Now I’m focused on generating a million dollars in revenue.”

I think the main difference that that

00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:08,400
we've wanted to effect is that so many

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,379
of the companies we invest in through

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,900
that kind of traditional seed investing

00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:17,430
that happens that kind of feeds up into

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:21,870
the bigger VC culture so much of the

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,010
advice and so many of the tactics that

00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,370
they implement are really designed

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,580
around the next fundable milestone so

00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,200
rather than kind of creating the kinds

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,089
of companies that necessary their best

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,420
equipped to build or chasing the

00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:38,039
opportunities their best equipped to

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,429
pursue so many of them make these

00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,780
trade-offs around the markets the

00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:45,390
tactics that are going to drive the next

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,640
round of funding and increase their

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,069
valuation versus create a long-term

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,749
durable business and so after you know

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:54,749
I've been in the venture business now

00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:57,569
for 15 years seeing this this trade-off

00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:59,190
between you know what they want to be

00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:01,949
building and what they have to build to

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,670
kind of get the support they need to be

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,280
able to scale in dvc kind of fell out of

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,990
a lot of those conversations and so when

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,490
I think of like what the profile is for

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,869
an indie VC style company we're trying

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,950
to distill that down to companies who

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,899
who look to get profitable quickly or

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,670
who are currently profitable and who

00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:22,500
want to kind of explore what that next

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,090
level of growth looks for that looks

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,340
like they can't fund out of cash yeah

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,409
well so I was sort of immediately

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,689
attracted to Bryce's idea of indie vc

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,100
because o'reilly itself was an indie VC

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,259
style company were started with five

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,539
hundred dollars you know basically

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,759
started selling services and eventually

00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,409
selling books and selling conferences

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,929
you know effectively doing things that

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,619
people wanted and it's a very different

00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:48,450
kind of business model and it's led us

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,530
to different choices as a business but

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,649
there are a lot of other companies that

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,479
have actually succeeded at this model

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,829
even in in tech and you may be mentioned

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,780
a few of those who've been inspirational

00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,130
for you yes so part of part of what

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,679
we're doing with ND VCS we're trying to

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,439
provide companies who aren't interested

00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:06,570
in having or would like to avoid that

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,770
kind of traditional VC playbook for as

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,629
long as possible we're trying to give

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,420
them access to a little bit of capital

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,770
and a lot of mentoring and so this last

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,760
week we spent

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,380
two days in Chicago kind of what we call

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,690
our quarterly retreats and we spent time

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,800
with a lot of founders who are building

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,870
companies in that vein one of the

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
companies we spent time with was one

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,670
that is called base camp run by a

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,400
founder named Jason freed base camp was

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:35,670
started years ago as part of a

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,950
consulting firm that's now developed

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,290
into a full-fledged SAS product that is

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,960
generating tens of millions of dollars a

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,390
year in profit never taken any outside

00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,360
funding that went to the balance sheet

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,670
and we see that happening a lot i'm even

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,740
if you look at one of the push backs

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,020
we've had is that like ambitious people

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,850
just don't build businesses these way or

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,440
that by not raising funding you're

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,840
somehow handicapping your opportunity

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,660
but if you look at the last three kind

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,700
of acquisitions of consequence of

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,140
private companies you had auto which was

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,620
about a 700 million dollar acquisition

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,290
by uber that was self funded no outside

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,660
capital for that company medianet was a

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,640
900 million dollar acquisition that was

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,670
recently purchased and then you know

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,410
another one recently was app lovin which

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,100
was bought for over a billion dollars

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,570
and in less than four years with no VC

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,120
funding they were able to grow and scale

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,500
and so I think a lot of those a lot of

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,360
the conventional wisdom we kind of take

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,570
for granted around what it takes to

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,300
start and scale a business you know

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,430
given the dynamics of you know online

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,850
resources and open source software like

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,440
so much of that cost and inability to

00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,860
scale has been removed in terms of

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,860
