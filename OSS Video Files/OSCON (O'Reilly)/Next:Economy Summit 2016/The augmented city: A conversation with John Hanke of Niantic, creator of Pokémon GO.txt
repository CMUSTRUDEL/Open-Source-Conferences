	00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,130
the inspiration was with my own kids to

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,660
use games as a motivation to get them

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,849
out of the house and outside walking

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,920
around into the parks to encourage

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,660
adults to go and explore parts of the

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,790
city that maybe you didn't normally go

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,550
to or stop and notice the local park

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,670
that you passed by but didn't notice

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,320
mirror worlds you know again is a super

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,660
influential book that may many most

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,199
people have not heard of what's

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,090
interesting about that yeah well learner

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,619
basically imagined the world that we

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,510
live in today but he did it 20 years ago

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:38,040
and essentially imagining this sort of

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,780
digital enhancement model of everything

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,010
that's happening in the world and he you

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,629
know thought about as a computer

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,040
scientist how interesting that would be

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,350
how useful it would be if you had this

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,840
sort of digital mirror of the physical

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,430
world and you know not just a sort of

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,780
replica in terms of what things look

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,370
like you know in the mapping sense of

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,440
Google Earth but all the systems you

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,410
know the economy the movement of people

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,090
and goods and transportation he imagined

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,739
a world where all that existed digitally

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,070
and could be studied and manipulated and

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,960
so on and you know shockingly 20 years

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,170
later we find ourselves inhabiting that

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,170
