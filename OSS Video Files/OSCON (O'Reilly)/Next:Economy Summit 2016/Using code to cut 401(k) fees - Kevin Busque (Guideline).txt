Description: 
	When it comes to retirement, management fees can make all the difference between a comfortable retirement and none at all. And with a complicated industry structure, there are lots of nested fees. Guideline founder and CEO Kevin Busque describes his company’s mission: “[We] worked our way up the stack, replacing every hand in the cookie jar with code.”

the 2016 Social Security annual report

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,019
says that Social Security funds will be

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,260
completely depleted by 2030 for that's a

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,150
real concern given that one in three

00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,810
Americans report that they don't have

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,119
any retirement savings whatsoever only

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,510
thirty-seven percent of small businesses

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,510
in the united states offer a 401k plan a

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,210
retirement benefit that leaves 50

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:34,350
million Americans without access to an

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,510
employer-sponsored retirement plan so

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,760
that's the access problem in the United

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,149
States as it stands right now but I want

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,379
to dig a little bit deeper on those

00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:45,989
participants that actually have plans

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:51,209
these are small businesses already

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,699
offering plants so today this is a

00:00:51,209 --> 00:00:56,399
typical graphic of a standard 401k

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,249
offering you'll notice here all of the

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,749
different ancillary businesses these are

00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:07,219
all third parties that do a very small

00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:11,609
portion of the overall plan design now

00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:14,700
the legacy solution in this country was

00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:17,280
designed 30 years ago it was essentially

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,759
created to be deceptive to plan

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,060
participants and the fees that they pay

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,090
so it's it's not by accident that sixty

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,070
percent of plan participants don't know

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,759
that they're playing any fees at all

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,270
inside their 401k it's completely by

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,649
design and it's completely intentional

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:39,570
when you dig in here you'll notice

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:42,299
there's plan administrators record

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,840
keepers insurances compliance custodians

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,069
it's incredibly confusing and I I reckon

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,189
that that's intentional each one of

00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:56,670
those previous services gets paid a

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,889
small fee those fees add up and those

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,880
make up the difference in growth that

00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:04,799
you see here it's a lot of money when

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,590
you look at those services and you

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,860
realize they don't bring the value that

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,659
they're being compensated in the plan

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,830
it's time to change something so we

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:18,210
changed the game

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:23,570
a guideline simplicity is quarter are

00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:26,910
offering what we've done is essentially

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,300
created record keeping record keeping is

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,740
a core service it's incredibly difficult

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:36,450
but it adds an enormous value to our

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,250
plan we essentially brought in every

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,570
single one of those third-party services

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,600
in-house we are full stack what that

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:50,180
means is we develop technology to

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:54,360
replace all of those services using code

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,580
we are essentially the only 401k

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,520
provider that brings every aspect of

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,720
servicing a plan in house we've changed

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,720
