Title: A conversation with Google DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman
Publication date: 2016-10-28

Description: 
	Google DeepMind is one of the most remarkable new AI companies. Its deep learning approach produces surprising results, demonstrating not just vast recall or the ability to compute faster than any human but what many people consider creativity. How far does deep learning take us toward a world of autonomous AI?

wasn't that kind of elite because for so

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,010
many years artificial intelligence has

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,309
over-promised and even now that it's

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,480
been successful we are seeing things

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,160
there's improvement in visions and

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,269
things like that but what makes you

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,340
think that it can take on the big

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,380
problems yeah it's a really good

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,449
question I mean in many ways the field

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,420
of the last 30 years has been dominated

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,160
by great deal of over over hype with

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,580
periodic winters where we've seen

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,890
massively reduced investment in in the

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,930
field largely because it's failed to

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,460
deliver I think this time round a number

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,210
of things are very different we have

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,920
incredible datasets we have the the

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,809
compute capacity to really take

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,570
advantage of the data that is available

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,480
and we've made incredible progress with

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,460
the algorithms that really those three

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,070
things together have allowed us to make

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,480
very significant progress and I guess we

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,550
were sort of lucky enough in some

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,890
respects that we made the right call on

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,359
deep learning before anybody else in the

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,160
field thought that it was possible to

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,539
make progress with these kinds of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,180
algorithms and you know partly why we

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,130
call deep mind and very quickly we

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,890
demonstrated that these could be used to

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,479
solve really quite general problems and

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,030
that's the value of deep learning

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,360
particularly is that they can solve a

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,890
wide range of tasks using you know

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,520
largely the same kind of algorithmic

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,520
