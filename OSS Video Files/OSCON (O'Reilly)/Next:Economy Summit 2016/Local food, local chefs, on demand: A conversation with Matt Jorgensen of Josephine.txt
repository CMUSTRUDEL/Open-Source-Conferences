Title: Local food, local chefs, on demand: A conversation with Matt Jorgensen of Josephine

Description: 
	Josephine has a unique place in the ecosystem of companies trying to reinvent food services. Unlike most services, which have focused on on-demand convenience either by placing orders from existing restauranteurs or by putting together new factories for “meal kits,” Josephine is a platform that connects consumers with home cooks. I’ve been a delighted customer and was really bummed when Josephine’s operations in my hometown of Oakland were halted while regulators sort out how to think about this innovative company. We’ll likely talk a bit about the regulatory issues, but what I really want to talk to Matt Jorgensen about is how Josephine enlivens the unique character of a city by creating economic opportunity for home chefs and bringing unlicensed cooking out of the shadows. I also want to talk about how Josephine has made every cook a shareholder.
