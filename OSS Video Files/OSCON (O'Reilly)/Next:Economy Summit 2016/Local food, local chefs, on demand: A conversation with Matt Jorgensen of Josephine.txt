Title: Local food, local chefs, on demand: A conversation with Matt Jorgensen of Josephine
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Josephine has a unique place in the ecosystem of companies trying to reinvent food services. Unlike most services, which have focused on on-demand convenience either by placing orders from existing restauranteurs or by putting together new factories for “meal kits,” Josephine is a platform that connects consumers with home cooks. I’ve been a delighted customer and was really bummed when Josephine’s operations in my hometown of Oakland were halted while regulators sort out how to think about this innovative company. We’ll likely talk a bit about the regulatory issues, but what I really want to talk to Matt Jorgensen about is how Josephine enlivens the unique character of a city by creating economic opportunity for home chefs and bringing unlicensed cooking out of the shadows. I also want to talk about how Josephine has made every cook a shareholder.

let's start and talk a little bit about

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,069
the counter trend of food that Josephine

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,889
is trying to encourage sure thank you

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,120
for having us I will start by saying I

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,880
was supposed to be joined by one of our

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,039
cooks crystal something came up last

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,300
minute which was disappointing she could

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,760
probably answer a lot of these questions

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,699
more articulately than I could but I'm

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,230
pleased to be here and and the thing

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,330
that we've observed over and over again

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,160
in the food industry is that even though

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,590
the industrial food system has made it

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,989
easier to get cheap craveable consistent

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,239
meals the most consistent and memorable

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,879
and emotive meals are still made and

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,460
cooked in homes and and we always say at

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,760
josephine people first food second

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,870
technology third i think a lot of the

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,940
consumer focused foodie movement has

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,739
been focused around the food product

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,120
itself and this is this is a trend

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,610
that's come up over and over again at

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,230
this conference but you know that the

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,270
foodie consumer movement has been around

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,460
you know what is the food how does it

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,870
make me feel where does it come from and

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,090
we're trying to shift some of that

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,180
dialogue over to the people on the story

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,680
behind the food and and so the goal of

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,510
Josephine is really to make cooks

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,220
empowered to be the face of their own

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,650
brand so that the story kind of

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,960
re-enters the experience of what you're

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,090
consuming and how you're connecting to

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,030
people in your community through one of

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,950
the most fundamental acts of human

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,290
society which is which is eating with

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,479
friends and family neighbors and these

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,310
are cooks who before Josephine didn't

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,710
really have an outlet a license out

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,600
outlet that is to sell food to consumers

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,040
so talk to us a little bit about the

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,619
implications to the labor market of

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,060
giving these cooks an avenue to earn

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,200
more income supplement what they're

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,810
already what they already getting from

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,090
possibly other jobs totally I mean I

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,799
think one of the interesting things is

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,270
the food industry is the biggest

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,310
industry in the country but it's it's

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,649
also sent on synonymous with minimum

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,840
wage and poor labor conditions and and

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,250
so the cooks that I mean we didn't

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,579
actually start this business with a

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,100
hypothesis of we're going to build a hot

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,229
food to go from home we started by

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,119
working with food entrepreneurs on the

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,979
ground in Oakland and Berkeley many of

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,259
whom had existing underground food

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,670
businesses either running pop-ups and

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,860
potlucks out of their homes or

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,319
you know doing church bake sales or even

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,390
you know selling tamales on street

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,480
corners and and all of that food

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,640
activity has been traditionally informal

00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,230
Tim talked earlier about you know the

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,319
jobs in our society that we choose to

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,970
compensate highly versus not and that's

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,700
one of the things that's predominant in

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,830
food is is this informal economy that's

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,630
either uncompensated or under

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,850
compensated and the exciting thing to us

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,700
is there are there are two million

00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,050
professional food well two million

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,360
professional cooks in this country and

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,269
tens of millions of experienced cooks

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,310
and what we look at is what is the

00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,350
opportunity for for those cooks you know

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,420
many of whom are immigrants or

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,150
stay-at-home parents or retirees that

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,860
you know haven't had either access to or

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,630
have frankly been disillusioned by the

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,430
professional food world and and what are

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:05,250
the opportunities that we can create for

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,100
them to make use of their existing skill

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,840
sets and lifestyle constraints for for

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,650
supplementary income as well as

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,650
