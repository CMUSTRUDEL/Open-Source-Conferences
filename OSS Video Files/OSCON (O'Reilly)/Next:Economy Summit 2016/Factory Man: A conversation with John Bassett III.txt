Title: Factory Man: A conversation with John Bassett III
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	One of the themes of the Next:Economy Summit is how our choices shape our future. The destruction of good jobs is not inevitable; it is the result of choices we make. John Bassett III is one of my heroes because he showed that itâ€™s possible to build a profitable company by making a different choice. When the 100-year-old family furniture company started by his grandfather, now a public company, shuttered its Virginia factory and gutted the town where it was based, he fought back, eventually winning an antidumping lawsuit against Chinese competitors and using the proceeds to reopen the local factory and rehire its workers.
