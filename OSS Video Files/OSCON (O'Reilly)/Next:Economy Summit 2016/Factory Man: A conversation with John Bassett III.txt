Title: Factory Man: A conversation with John Bassett III
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	One of the themes of the Next:Economy Summit is how our choices shape our future. The destruction of good jobs is not inevitable; it is the result of choices we make. John Bassett III is one of my heroes because he showed that itâ€™s possible to build a profitable company by making a different choice. When the 100-year-old family furniture company started by his grandfather, now a public company, shuttered its Virginia factory and gutted the town where it was based, he fought back, eventually winning an antidumping lawsuit against Chinese competitors and using the proceeds to reopen the local factory and rehire its workers.

we got to know each other because we

00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:09,400
both have this world view that companies

00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:11,349
can be run in a different way and you

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,869
have this incredible story so you come

00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:17,160
from I think it is it a 10 generation

00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:19,779
Virginia family or it was she goes way

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,480
1621 it wasn't quite the Mayflower but

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:24,789
it was like sometime around them and and

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,410
your family has lived in the same

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:29,019
community in Virginia for many many

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:33,400
decades and ran a very well-known

00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:35,260
furniture company that was really a you

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,030
know it was a company town the town that

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,600
you absolutely that I'm in bassett

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:46,420
Virginia right and but a few decades ago

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,210
they began to come up against the issues

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,800
of globalization Chinese were

00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,810
commoditizing the furniture market I

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,650
think furniture actually is one of the

00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:59,790
most hard hit markets but I by trade by

00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:03,400
by foreign competition and at the time

00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:05,260
your family's firm was struggling you

00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,170
were not put in charge but you went off

00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,050
and started your own private furniture

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,270
firm about 70 miles away and they became

00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,330
kind of a tale of two companies in a way

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:19,990
right true I actually did not start that

00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:23,560
company my wife's grandfather worked for

00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:25,840
my grandfather and in 1919 he left and

00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,120
started a company called bone bassett

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,510
furniture company now I'm a bastard so

00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,340
everybody relates to the past ok and

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,360
that's my family that's why I learned

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,940
the business but yes in 1983 I left and

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,220
so you you basically came up with a

00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,020
different model that had totally

00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,320
different outcomes you were able to

00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,750
create a take very commoditized business

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,000
an old-line manufacturing business and

00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,159
because of decisions that you took keep

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,720
jobs in the community kind of walk us

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,190
through that story what what were the

00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,119
turning points what did you do that was

00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,700
different from what your competitors

00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:04,840
were doing okay we've been in business

00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:09,159
since 1990 we were not new we made wood

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,420
bedroom furniture and then when 2001 the

00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:15,020
Chinese joined the world trade

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:20,360
organisation prices plummeted it they

00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:23,030
just absolutely plummeted and we had to

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,510
side what we were going to do and people

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,370
were panicking the Stampede was on Wall

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,440
Street wanted you to close all your

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,750
factories that's the thing to do and

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,959
that was advice you would hear from

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,390
investment bankers and etc so we looked

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,569
at it I had two sons and we said what

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,790
are we going to do the stockholders was

00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,000
scared to death employees are scared to

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:49,340
death the community was scared to death

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,989
customers were leaving us because they

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,420
did not think we would stay in this

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,739
country we disappear so they wanted to

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,790
leave while they could still get

00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:02,239
products and it was a crisis and we

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:07,250
decided that the only way we could exist

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,850
and survive is with the whole company

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:15,260
working together we had to talk to the

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:17,750
people so we accidentally formed what I

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,120
call the final group rules and we

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,060
stumbled into it I mean button brilliant

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,709
so now part and here the rules we went

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,500
to the people and we said here's a

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,709
problem now if we're going to stay in

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,060
this community we have to do it together

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:37,790
and it's called attitude an attitude

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:41,170
ladies and gentlemen is a mindset it's a

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:45,829
it's a mindset winning is a mindset

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:49,100
unfortunately losing is a mindset in my

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:52,489
opinion in this country we've lost some

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,600
of this we used to want to compete now

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:58,510
we want to turn tail and run so we sat

00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,819
down with our people and we were shocked

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,310
they had given up they'd see Joe and why

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,680
do you think we can do this when larger

00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,600
companies are leaving they were watching

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,780
television in the read the paper the

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:17,239
internet or whatever and we were shocked

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:21,620
our people have become quitters now that

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,110
leads to rule number two how do you turn

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,520
around and add it

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,820
ladies and gentlemen you turn it around

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,720
with leadership that's how you do it i

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,669
mean old-fashioned leadership I'm not

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,580
talking about golden parachutes and

00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:39,919
stock options it's what I learned in the

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,540
military don't ask anybody to do

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,030
anything you're not willing to do

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,160
yourself and when they come came to work

00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,110
in the in the morning I cause were in

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,780
the parking lot but they left I cars

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,100
from the parking lot it has a problem we

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,100
