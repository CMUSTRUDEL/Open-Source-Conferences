Title: Making humans cool again: A conversation with Paul English
Publication date: 2016-10-13
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Paul English’s last startup, Kayak, used search technology to commoditize travel; his new one, Lola, bets that people will pay a premium for a better experience. Paul’s vision of pairing up AI and human expertise to create a far better user experience than either could do alone is at the very heart of the Next Economy story and has so much to teach us about how to do business in the future. How can we not feature a guy who says that he wants his new startup to “make humans cool again”?

	00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,500
you were one of the cofounders of kayak

00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:07,960
services like kayak actually pushed

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,360
travel agents to the brink so we're down

00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,849
from something like 34,000 travel agents

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,889
in the mid-nineties to about 13,000

00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:20,080
today I would imagine those agencies are

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:22,420
also much smaller so we've had this long

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,520
narrative arc about technology making

00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,270
humans obsolete and replacing them with

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,880
software but now you trying to go in the

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:32,980
other direction so what brought you to

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,409
that and how are you doing it yeah i

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,140
will say i don't want to say i'm

00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,879
motivated by guilt but i had a little

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,289
bit of guilt iran the kayakers in

00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,969
hearing that people that used to go to

00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:44,499
travel agents when we made it really

00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:46,989
simple to me everything online they just

00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:49,390
decided to do themselves but really with

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:52,120
kayak I spent ten years of my life

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,499
trying to change online travel and what

00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,649
I'm doing now with Lola my new company

00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:58,510
is focusing on offline travel one thing

00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:02,229
that's surprising to most people who

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,570
work in tech is it in the US travel

00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:06,670
booked on the phone is about forty six

00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,410
percent of all travel so people still

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,380
are using agents they either use

00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:14,680
old-school travel agents business travel

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,870
agents adventure travel agents cruise

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,910
safari on and on and on there are still

00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,410
agents out there they also will call

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,880
merit directly they'll call Delta

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,590
Airlines directly so a lot is still

00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,020
conducted over the phone and what we're

00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,550
trying to do with Lola is revolutionize

00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,290
that if you want to use your phone you

00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,760
want a human involve you think there are

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:32,320
better more efficient ways to do it than

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,250
a bit done previously well it's also

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,950
interesting I think about my own

00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,750
experience I tend to book my own travel

00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,760
for anything that's routine because it's

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:42,280
super easy but as soon as it gets

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,960
complicated you know I sent often in you

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,850
know an email to vivienne russell it's

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,560
like hey Vivian I got this complicated

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,890
thing can you help me figure it yeah

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,660
yeah yeah and so your point is that

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,970
there's still a lot of things that

00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:56,320
humans do better and a lot of people

00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,390
want to want to have that human

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,780
interaction but so how exactly are you

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,510
going to you know use technology to

00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,880
enable those people to get better I mean

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,950
what are you actually doing at lolla so

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,140
I have three tech teams at lolla we're

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,780
startup or based in Boston one team

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,280
building the mobile app

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,560
for people right now an iphone coming

00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,420
out in android that's a small team my

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,530
second team is a five-person AI team

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,240
which i can describe it a little bit

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,370
with it what they're doing with nlu and

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,740
NLP and then the third team which the

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,480
biggest team is writing software for the

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,220
travel agents and i would say that

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,989
travel agents if you were to actually

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,590
look at the software they use say it's

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:37,940
kind of shocking blue screen and just

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,980
these crazy arcane keyboard combinations

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:43,920
where i would say the technology has not

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,690
been updated in more than 10 years and

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,489
we're trying to do is rethink the

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,720
software the travel agents use and it's

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,910
almost like we running kayak from

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,620
scratch but instead of writing at people

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,560
like you or me rewriting for people who

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,200
are really extreme power users and we

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,190
want to make sure we think that by

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,870
revolutionising the software that travel

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,239
agents get to work with it actually will

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,100
revolutionize by almost by side effects

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,500
what's going to be like for travelers as

00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,150
you want to interact with humans

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,580
specifically Lola right now is a

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,959
messaging app so you can text you can

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,690
either talk on the phone with a travel

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,730
agent email or text a lot of it is done

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,739
by text actually and we want to make

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,390
sure that it's a very it's an experience

00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,329
very threaded with so to online and

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,840
offline conversational you I rich UI and

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:30,329
that experience where you can type

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,340
questions pictures come back videos come

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,079
back you can interact with them you can

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,180
type you can click buttons that

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,739
interaction only works if the travel

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,519
agent self has really sophisticated

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,519
