Title: Grail: A conversation with Jeff Huber
Publication date: 2016-10-26
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Jeff Huber is a legendary engineering manager from Google. His new company, Grail, is working to develop a blood test for the early detection of cancer. It’s simple: many people die not because cancer is incurable but because we find it too late to cure it. We talk with Jeff about why tackling this problem matters, what’s new in technology that makes solving it plausible, and why investors have bet $100 million on the proposition that genomics and computation will create whole new industries.

	00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,290
so our goal a Grail bio is instead of

00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,450
detecting here on a battlefield where

00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:13,190
you lose we want to shift it to where

00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:15,650
you can win why hasn't there been this

00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:18,500
early detection prior to now what is it

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,020
that happened in the last few years that

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,820
made you think oh this is it's time to

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,420
start a company that's going to do this

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,960
yeah this timing matters a lot and Grail

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,890
is is really a a bet on the intersection

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,480
of timing of three things of us having

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,890
made enough progress and the

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,539
understanding of fundamental cancer

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,489
biology and how it works and why it

00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,640
works that's really enabled by

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,569
underlying sequencing technology so our

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,809
test works

00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:49,999
by doing what we call ultra deep genome

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,030
sequencing of the of the blood that we

00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:54,920
get and in that we're looking for

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,010
circulating nucleic acids fragmentary

00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,949
DNA and RNA that shed by cancer from us

00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:03,499
very earliest stage and it's really only

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:05,539
been the last couple of years where

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:07,969
sequencing technology has come along far

00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:09,590
enough where the accuracy is there where

00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,560
the economics are there to be able to

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,840
pull that off because we're sequencing

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,399
an order of magnitude broader and two or

00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,109
three orders of magnitude deeper than

00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:19,549
anyone else has done before so we're

00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:23,329
generating on the order of a terabyte of

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:26,240
data for each test subject now just to

00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:28,640
make sure I understand this I I would

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,789
have thought that a genome sequence is

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,469
sort of canonical and it's your sequence

00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,820
and that's one thing but what you're

00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:39,439
saying is that there are sort of these

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,750
markers that are cancerous RNA or DNA

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,429
that's in the bloodstream exactly

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,780
exactly and that's what we're that's

00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:45,979
what we're measuring and those are shed

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,600
by cancer

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,579
it appears the underlying biology from

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,740
the very earliest stages of cancer and

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:56,030
there has been you know over the last 50

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,609
years in in oncology there's been people

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,890
pursuing other mechanisms for doing this

00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:03,039
and they're commonly known as biomarkers

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,659
and the majority of them have been

00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,500
either protein based markers or antigen

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:11,480
markers there's some ones you might have

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,190
heard of like PSA prostate specific

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,190
antigen there's others for

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,360
gie type cancers is one called CEA

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:27,730
carcinoembryonic antigen there's other

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:30,049
ca-125 CA 99 that are very specific

00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:33,319
markers the challenge of those has been

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:36,010
though that those are operating in a

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,140
very complex system in your body and

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,180
they're really second and third order

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,220
effects they're symptoms of symptoms and

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,720
because the body is so complex because

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,030
there are so many compensating factors

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,459
in the body it turns out that with those

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,530
biomarkers that people have historically

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:53,030
attempted the false positive rates were

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,340
too high the false negative rates were

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,739
too high so there was never any net

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,170
benefit being delivered to to patients

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:03,019
or to the medical system instead what

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:06,319
we're measuring with the circular

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,060
nucleic acids DNA and RNA is really a

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,519
first-order measure we are measuring the

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,730
cancer itself so it's our expectation

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,109
that we will have a much more accurate

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,079
much lower false negative much lower

00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:22,329
false positive test that we'll have

00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:22,329
