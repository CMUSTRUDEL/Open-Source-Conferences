Description: 
	Jeff Huber is a legendary engineering manager from Google. His new company, Grail, is working to develop a blood test for the early detection of cancer. It’s simple: many people die not because cancer is incurable but because we find it too late to cure it. We talk with Jeff about why tackling this problem matters, what’s new in technology that makes solving it plausible, and why investors have bet $100 million on the proposition that genomics and computation will create whole new industries.
