you gotta go to war with the army you

00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,859
have you know five years ago you know

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,780
new programming language would come out

00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,639
and you'd hire somebody who knew that or

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,680
a new marketing automation tool came out

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,000
and you could do that well the way

00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,160
things are working now the pace of

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,490
change of Technology you cannot hire in

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,380
for every new technology or framework

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:23,450
that comes onto the market you have to

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,460
go to war with the army you have which

00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,470
means you've got to pay attention to how

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,869
they're learning and what they need and

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,110
the level that they're at instead of

00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:34,550
just always looking to recruit in and I

00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,690
think that's an important thing that all

00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,890
companies have to really pay attention

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,600
to and it's something I'm really

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,070
concerned about Riley I think also

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,110
thinking about how to develop that

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,000
talent once they're in i think you know

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,770
Millennials talk about how the most

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,739
important job perk they can get is

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,630
opportunities for growth and development

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:52,100
you have you have the very simple fact

00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,130
that I mean we love this in the in the

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,989
web development world you have as MIT

00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,000
more open positions for mid-level

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,920
developers than you do for junior level

00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,480
developers and if you think about that

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,909
that's the opposite of a pyramid it's

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,939
the straight line which means we are

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,590
currently as a sort of ecosystem setting

00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:12,289
ourselves up for the exact same problem

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,569
tomorrow that we have today which is not

00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:16,700
enough people in the pipeline developing

00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:19,340
along to fill all the seats that we need

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,170
in the future yeah and that's but to fix

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,819
that you need company companies need to

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,009
be thinking very thoughtfully

00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:27,289
longer-term about how they're developing

00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,429
the talent they have how they're

00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:31,789
sourcing how they're sourcing from

00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:34,009
diverse sources as well and and all of

00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:37,459
these things requires a different more

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,770
thoughtful and you know really sort of

00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,679
new paradigm and how you think about

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,310
recruiting staffing training developing

00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:45,310
