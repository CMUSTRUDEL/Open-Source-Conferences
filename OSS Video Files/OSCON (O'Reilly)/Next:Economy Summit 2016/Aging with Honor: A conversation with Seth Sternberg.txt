Title: Aging with Honor: A conversation with Seth Sternberg
Publication date: 2016-10-14
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	When I ask companies to consider the big, hairy problems that need solving, I often think about the challenge of aging populations and the inverted demographic pyramid that will profoundly shape the future of the developed world. In Japan, they are experimenting with robots as companions to the elderly. Honor has a better idea: let’s just make it easier to vet and schedule real human caregivers for the elderly and those suffering from debilitating disease. While other entrepreneurs were going after “the Uber of drycleaning,” “the Uber of valet parking,” and other services that Twitter pundit Startup L. Jackson derides as “assisted living for the young,” Honor realized that modern technology could solve a real, vexing problem for those whose loved ones need special care.

	00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,470
there are 40 million people over the age

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,269
of 65 in America today and very soon

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,660
that's going to be 80 million people and

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,300
then if we look outside our borders a

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,800
country is considered inverted when more

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,429
than twenty percent of the population is

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,369
over 65 in Japan Italy and Germany are

00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:25,380
all already inverted Northern Europe is

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,329
I'm going to invert then America in

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,899
China if you think about one child

00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:33,300
policy is also going to invert and so we

00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:37,320
have a very rapidly aging population

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,200
across much of the world and when you

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,840
look at how we care for the elderly we

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,170
do not have good systems in place you

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,660
know full stop when you look at helping

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,060
someone stay in their homes and ninety

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,290
percent of the elderly want to stay in

00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,760
their homes as they age think about

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,440
yourself what you want to be forced from

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,050
your home just because you got a little

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,610
bit older of course not well how can we

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,200
help people stay in their homes right

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,470
and how can we do that economically and

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,439
so non medical home care is one very

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,780
important part of that equation and the

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,909
discussion around how tack artificial

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,729
intelligence is in the future going to

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,859
assist people in their jobs do you how

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,420
do you see you know elderly care in the

00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,009
home is something that you want a human

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,420
there with you so kind of how do you

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,310
either of you can see both the

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,439
opportunities for BOTS or AI to help

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,850
assist or supplement the care that human

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,590
caregivers are able to give in the home

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,380
to the elderly yeah so honor is a human

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,959
service right you want a human to go

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,659
care for your parents and our customers

00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,819
think of honor as the person who walks

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,740
across the door and says hello my name

00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,529
is you know Joanne and I'm here to serve

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,469
you what the technology is doing is it's

00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:51,959
making Joanne substantially better right

00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:55,319
it got Joanne there faster was with less

00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,149
traffic so she's less harried it made us

00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,789
more efficient so that we could redirect

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,639
dollars to pay Joanne well above

00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,619
industry average it made sure that you

00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:06,959
know if your mom has cats in the home in

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,210
dementia that Joanne is not allergic to

00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,120
cats and is trained to deal with someone

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,830
who has dementia right and it made sure

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,360
that if Joanne is sick

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,520
and your mom literally needs physical

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,740
help to get out of bed and say you live

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,570
two hours away that we can backfill

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,060
Joanne very quickly with the next most

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,500
appropriate person so you know we want

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,500
