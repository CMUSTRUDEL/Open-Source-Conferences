Title: Our World in Data - Max Roser (University of Oxford)
Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	Graphs and maps from Max Roser’s Our World in Data have become a fixture on social media and in thoughtful conversations around the world. They provide deep historical and global context on centuries of progress about issues such as life expectancy, poverty, education, health, and income inequality. Much as Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends Report is eagerly studied by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, Our World in Data is scrutinized for signs of where we are headed and what matters.  The history he unveils is fundamentally hopeful. Despite all the short-term worries about technological unemployment, Max reminds us that if we play our cards right, the future is still bright.

we saw how this expansion of education

00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,799
translated into better living conditions

00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,920
and now I want to have a cautious look

00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:15,650
into the future of global education and

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,440
in contrast with many other social

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,840
aspects where I'm pretty skeptical about

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,970
making future projections I do think

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,000
that we can know something about the

00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,160
future of Education by just comparing

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
the education of the young generation of

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,480
today with the education of the older

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,250
generation and if we do this again for

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,230
this basic measure of literacy we see

00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:39,680
that for the older generation of today

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:42,140
the 65 year olds and older in many parts

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,640
of the world the literacy rate is still

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:49,850
well below 30% many parts of Asia Africa

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,110
Latin America Middle America and if we

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,450
now compare this with the young

00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,570
generation we see how much the world has

00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:59,840
already changed Latin America has caught

00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:02,960
up much of Asia has caught up Africa is

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,640
also catching up may be worth to point

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,030
out northern Africa and the Middle East

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,609
and how education has improved there

00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,719
there are projections of the future

00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:14,780
education of the entire world population

00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:17,509
done by the eásá Institute that are in

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,539
fact very good firstly we see that the

00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:22,670
world population will stop to increase

00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:26,630
at some point in the second half of the

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,779
21st century around 2070 in their medium

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:31,340
projection now we see that the number of

00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:33,529
children in the world is already

00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,020
declining there will never be more

00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:39,859
children than today in the world the

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,979
expansion of the world population is due

00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:45,279
to population momentum and increasing

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,929
lifespans and then we see here in red

00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:51,709
the number of people with no education

00:01:47,929 --> 00:01:53,840
that will basically go down to zero few

00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:56,029
people in the world will only have

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,069
primary education and a large number of

00:01:56,029 --> 00:02:00,469
people will have secondary education or

00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:05,989
tertiary education shown here in green

00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:08,479
and a world where more than 7 billion

00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:10,610
people have secondary education or

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,710
higher is a word that can just solve

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,710
