Description: 
	When one of the most successful labor leaders of the modern era resigns his job to work on what at first seems a radical new notion—universal basic income (UBI)—it highlights just how deeply our economy is changing. When he’s joined in that quest by Y Combinator, one of the wellsprings of Silicon Valley entrepreneurship, things get even more interesting. Natalie Foster of the Aspen Institute hosts a conversation with Andy Stern, author of the new book Raising the Floor, and Elizabeth Rhodes, who is heading up Y Combinator’s new universal basic income experiments. We get a chance to hear how the quintessential Silicon Valley take on UBI—driven by data and experiments, not political action—comes together with the labor activism of Andy Stern to rethink the social safety net for the 21st century.
