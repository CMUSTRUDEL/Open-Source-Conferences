Title: Is it time for a universal basic income? - Elizabeth Rhodes (Y Combinator Research)
Publication date: 2016-10-11
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	When one of the most successful labor leaders of the modern era resigns his job to work on what at first seems a radical new notion—universal basic income (UBI)—it highlights just how deeply our economy is changing. When he’s joined in that quest by Y Combinator, one of the wellsprings of Silicon Valley entrepreneurship, things get even more interesting. Natalie Foster of the Aspen Institute hosts a conversation with Andy Stern, author of the new book Raising the Floor, and Elizabeth Rhodes, who is heading up Y Combinator’s new universal basic income experiments. We get a chance to hear how the quintessential Silicon Valley take on UBI—driven by data and experiments, not political action—comes together with the labor activism of Andy Stern to rethink the social safety net for the 21st century.

and so I think it's a realization that

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,509
there could be a future in which we

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,460
really need a different way of

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,059
redistributing resources I think even

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,040
now the current system is Amy said was

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,220
not working and there's a great

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,260
concentration of wealth and inequality

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:22,520
and so I think you know it's both

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,050
technology and a fundamental desire to

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,600
make positive contributions and to solve

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,890
problems that you know for-profit

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,890
