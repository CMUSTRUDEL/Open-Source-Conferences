Publication date: 2016-10-27
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The past decade has seen a huge upsurge in peer-produced entertainment shared through Internet-scale platforms. Many people spend far more time on YouTube or Facebook than watching traditional media. Yet the mechanisms by which these creators get paid have lagged. Advertising money is starting to flow through to creators in significant amounts, but if there’s anything to be learned from the old economy of media, it’s that one business model is not enough. Old media was built on a rich ecosystem of business models, with multiple ways for people to get paid. We talk with Jack Conte, founder of Patreon, about how crowdsourced patronage is providing steady income for artists, musicians, cartoonists, and other creative professionals.
