Title: Funding the creative economy - Jack Conte (Patreon)
Publication date: 2016-10-27
Playlist: Next:Economy Summit 2016
Description: 
	The past decade has seen a huge upsurge in peer-produced entertainment shared through Internet-scale platforms. Many people spend far more time on YouTube or Facebook than watching traditional media. Yet the mechanisms by which these creators get paid have lagged. Advertising money is starting to flow through to creators in significant amounts, but if there’s anything to be learned from the old economy of media, it’s that one business model is not enough. Old media was built on a rich ecosystem of business models, with multiple ways for people to get paid. We talk with Jack Conte, founder of Patreon, about how crowdsourced patronage is providing steady income for artists, musicians, cartoonists, and other creative professionals.

but it allows people to build a

00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:07,090
following to build a community and we

00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,309
found that patreon works best for people

00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,690
who love their communities and for

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:13,059
people whose communities love them back

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,530
so it really is about the person you

00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:17,830
know throughout the artist not

00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,380
necessarily this single or that blog

00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,599
post you know it's not a tip jar this is

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,400
patronage this is the way the Arts have

00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,869
been funded literally for thousands and

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,849
thousands of years somebody gave

00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:32,099
Beethoven a bag of coins and said go

00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:32,099
