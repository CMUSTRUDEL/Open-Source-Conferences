	00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,660
we have a world where technology is giving us enormous power to do new

00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:14,140
things but we also look around us and we say we're using that power wisely that

00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,980
if you want to have a high functioning society you must match the rate of

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,200
technological commercial innovation with equal amounts of civic innovation

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,630
machines are not going to take over us we're gonna take over the machines. To me

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,440
AI is going to happen its technology that's inevitable the question is how do

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,719
we design in the human in the loop so that the human gets more leverage a lot

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,530
of the challenges that workers are facing in the gig economy or the on-line

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,030
economy are very similar to the things that domestic workers have been facing for

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,049
decades you know the resume is dead know like which companies you've worked

00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:56,109
in the past and what title you had what's really helpful least you

00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,780
know what you know what are you passionate about

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,499
we're not great at assessing people and so we do focus on the wrong things and

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:07,610
so there's sure tremendously qualified people all over the place in the United

00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,509
States who are being overlooked because they went to the wrong school or because

00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:14,250
something as simple as they don't know how to put a resume together they don't

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,390
know how to interview people don't have a clue what to tell their kids to study

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,270
what kind of credentials their kids need greatest reason for optimism about the

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,600
next economy is the fact that this is so they were so much more potential in

00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,219
people and we've done so little to really bring it out although this

00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,840
industry was growing by leaps and bounds all around us when I looked in the rooms

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,670
of many of the conferences and many of the meet-up events and many of training

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,520
events I didn't see too many people that look like me there is actually no

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,280
tradeoff between inequality and growth if we fight inequality and

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,700
international evidence shows this we will also get more growth these new

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,170
economy issues Tim are not partisan issues both parties right now are being

00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,790
roiled by fundamental anxieties about economic dislocation there are moments

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:12,580
in companies are and I'd say countries that are strategic inflection points where

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,650
something huge is happening that could either have a positive or negative

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,980
direction and I think that's where we are about jobs and income right now but

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,250
we will remember a hundred years from now is this whether when the American

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,310
dream was at its greatest level of risk a handful of courageous people have the

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,000
courage to stand up and do something about it

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,500
