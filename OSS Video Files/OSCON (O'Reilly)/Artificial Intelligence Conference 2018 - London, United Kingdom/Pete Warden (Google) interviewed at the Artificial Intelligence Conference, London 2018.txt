hi I'm parka Nathan with O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,990
and today it's a great pleasure to get

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,969
to speak here with a good friend Pete

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:14,190
worden from Google and what's your title

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:16,379
that's a good question I think tech lead

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,710
for mobile and embedded tensorflow Oh

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,660
fantastic fantastic you know I've got to

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,529
say that I think it's been maybe five

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,460
years ago you invited me up to lunch I

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,170
remember we were looking through the

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,800
image recognition that was probably the

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,530
first time I'd ever seen a real deep

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,930
learning app for something useful of

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,340
course it was something truly

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,790
interesting as deep learning there and

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:45,510
then from there tensorflow and the rest

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,829
emerged basically what's this thing so

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:54,840
this is a microcontroller I'm just gonna

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:58,440
hold it up here and this is something

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:02,699
you can get for under $2 from eBay

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,070
individually so I bought a box of 100 of

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,840
them which I now have cluttering up my

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:13,950
living room but what I really like about

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,770
them is that they're actually pretty

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,720
easy to program interesting and having

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,820
something that's really cheap and really

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,320
low power and has a bunch of compute on

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,570
it I mean it's kind of like the next

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,790
level beyond the Raspberry Pi in terms

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,770
of just having something you don't have

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,340
to worry about if I step on one of these

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,549
it will hurt my foot a little bit I can

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,829
just pick up another one do the cats

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,380
pick them up in the toilet yes yeah I

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,020
actually had to do a reorganization of

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,340
my tech corner as it's called because we

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:51,649
discovered one of the cats had actually

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:53,880
taken a jump and lead which was really

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:57,619
like a cat so dangerous enough without

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,530
letting them getting to electronics

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:02,610
they're evolving yes what's what's the

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,270
name of a board like that

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:10,190
um so it's funny because this is

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:14,870
actually a a Chinese

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:17,890
created board and it doesn't have we've

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,230
seen various different names for these

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,330
yeah which is you know surprising but

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:29,860
they've come to be known as the blue

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:34,090
pill board yes and they are actually

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:39,380
clones they're very very similar to

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:41,870
stmicroelectronics f103 chips so they

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,800
they're they work exactly alike a you

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,890
know I think I might have seen that

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,920
they're actually licensed from st but

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,470
they're because they're the pretty much

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,160
the cheapest microcontrollers you can

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,510
buy individually interesting okay

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,670
they've become really popular with a

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,490
whole bunch of hobbyists and you can

00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,740
find all sorts of sort of websites about

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,130
like programming these to do you know

00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,110
whatever you want - ooh and for

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,150
programming do you use ticket cable in

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,610
and do it on your laptop yeah so you

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,220
actually you can do that I have I've

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:18,920
actually found it easier and I have some

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,230
resources on how to do this using a

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,960
Raspberry Pi Oh as the thing that you

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,510
program it from interest so the last

00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,740
loop I is kind of the Big Daddy and this

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:33,620
is the you use the GPIO ports and you

00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:37,060
just plug in like four wires from the

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:41,090
Raspberry Pi you use the open OCD

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:44,270
software you can download and yeah I've

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,670
got a whole bunch of instructions and

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:52,130
some pretty diagrams for how to wire

00:03:46,670 --> 00:04:00,170
this up on it's at github comm Ford /

00:03:52,130 --> 00:04:05,180
Google Ford / stm32 underscore bear VAR

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:10,970
e underscore Lib Li B as Google on

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:12,200
github and then stm32 bear live and I'm

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:19,910
sure we'll figure out some way of

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:22,260
getting the there's almost a kind of

00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,630
continuous deployment process

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,450
than going from the Raspberry Pi under

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,850
these boards yes and the other nice

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,270
thing is you can actually run software

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:37,200
emulation of these two so we do actually

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:40,080
have we have been doing you know you can

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,300
debug and test and run on your laptop

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,180
without needing any actual physical

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,040
hardware to hand so there's a great

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,690
project out there called renown

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:55,020
re n OD e which lets you you'll see some

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:59,310
references to it in the stm32 barely

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,690
project where you can actually just run

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,060
this without having any physical

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,410
hardware at all and just you know play

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,410
around with it Oh wonderful

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,480
and and also just to give some context

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,780
here what kind of applications are doing

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,180
with this so one of the things I'm

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,630
really interested in doing is running

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,080
machine learning models on this which

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:23,190
may sound like a crazy idea but

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,110
especially because I don't know if I

00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:31,050
mentioned but this only has 20 kilobytes

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:35,670
of RAM really and 64 K flash Wow my USB

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,310
stick probably yes and you might ask

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,620
well why you were looking at a you know

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,930
a chip that that you know that is that

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,120
little storage oh the main thing is that

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,430
chips like these are both very very

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,140
cheap like in industrial quantities you

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,380
can buy them for well below 50 cents

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,480
each and they use very very little power

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,970
like you can run something like this on

00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,580
a coin battery for you know weeks and

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:02,220
hopefully months so you're really like

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,530
you know liberated from having to you

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,360
know sort of charge or plug in you can

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,710
use it in all sorts of places because

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,900
it's so cheap you don't have to worry

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,730
about a little you know solar cell that

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,190
catches it or apply today or some

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,080
exactly energy harvesting from like you

00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:19,920
know just the lights in a room is

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,440
totally possible so it starts to open up

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,800
all of these applications for doing

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,420
compute completely off the grid like you

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,610
don't need any network you don't need

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,890
any power you just have little

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,190
standalone magical devices that just

00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,860
kind of like power self-powered you know

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,710
and a half cents

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,280
zongman can kind of hopefully make sense

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,020
of the world around them could they

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,599
conceivably do any kind of mesh or

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,879
networking low-power network amongst

00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,879
themselves they definitely could I've

00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,770
actually been really focused on things

00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,000
that you can do without any network at

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,729
all okay great

00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,340
just because the power that's required

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:02,490
to do any kind of radio it's like it

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,830
seems like the rule of thumb is like the

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,949
smaller distance you can move bits the

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,900
less power so doing computation on this

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,139
users up almost no power doing like a

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,569
with meticulous up almost no power if

00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,250
you have to fire up even a Bluetooth

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,319
low-energy or something like that then

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,590
you're suddenly into the you know double

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,300
digit milliwatts and then like Wi-Fi can

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,289
either easily be hundreds of milliwatts

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,629
and you know whereas doing computer on

00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:33,819
this can be like single-digit milliwatts

00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:37,210
which means you can do it for so much

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:39,490
longer Oh fantastic now what what types

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,669
of machine learning have you been able

00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:44,830
to do put onto advice like this so um

00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:49,839
it's still very much a work in progress

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,639
but you really can take your networks

00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,199
you know like just like the ones that we

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,250
were playing around with five years ago

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,919
- image recognition and do things like

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:04,150
very simple voice recognition so if you

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,919
actually look at the you know the phone

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:11,830
the modern phones that are out today

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,839
things like Siri and you know okay

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:20,849
Google and my phone usually goes off

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:25,419
when I say that but they actually have

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:29,409
very simple voice recognition models

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:32,260
running locally on chips very much like

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,120
this so that the main CPU doesn't have

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,149
to be powered up so that they can

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,690
actually spot when somebody says

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,610
something running on this like very very

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,199
low-power chip that's separate from the

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,449
main CPU so it's not draining much

00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,779
battery and then if it thinks it's heard

00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:51,079
you say the

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:53,990
words then it will actually fire up the

00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:57,050
main you know the main application

00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,319
process the main CPU and it will run a

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,199
larger model but if you like Apple had a

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:05,059
great article about how they do Siri

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:08,990
on their phones and they talk about

00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:13,149
running a very small sound recognition

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:15,649
like speech recognition network on their

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,730
DSP which is very very similar to this

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:21,740
sort of device yes interesting well I

00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,290
can imagine given the weight and the

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,569
power and all this could fit on to all

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:32,629
kinds of mobile devices I mean mobile as

00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:34,100
in things that fly and swim yes yes well

00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,079
I like I like the idea of just like

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,610
sticking this on as a sticker too you

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,470
know if you had a little bit of battery

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,180
or a little you know solar panel you

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,720
could basically just stick this to

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,129
anything you've only got and then you

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,569
know that's a fascinating part to you

00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:49,370
you're just going before there's only

00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,410
few chips but it seems like the bigger

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,029
parts of it are actually the the

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,309
switches the parts that would be

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,449
sometimes try to touch if you didn't

00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:59,000
have to do that it could be a really

00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:00,500
flat exactly so the main you can see

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,990
that sort of like the diamond shaped

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,000
chip that's really the only sort of

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:08,269
essential pieces everything else is like

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,670
peripheral so yeah we've actually found

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,610
we have some great little prototype

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,519
boards from ambach micro who are startup

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:19,009
doing extremely low-power versions of

00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,120
these and they actually have a coin

00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:24,800
battery circuit board and the coin

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,180
battery is like the largest piece and

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,879
the rest of the circuit board is just

00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,240
kind of you know the you know the chip

00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:35,509
in the middle and then so yeah the power

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,389
use of the power is really the you know

00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,920
the limiting factor here and the really

00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:41,929
nice thing about them your networks is

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,029
they're almost all compute there's

00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:47,660
almost no memory access needed they

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:50,240
don't need a network radio so it's

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,910
something that's really really cheap in

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,559
terms of power usage it's running your

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,949
networks which is why there's such an

00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,620
interesting fit for these

00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:02,300
microcontrollers

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,280
for these networks can you give some

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,530
scales and reference it competitively

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,760
how large are they with the types of

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,560
deep learning models that people are

00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,260
talking about the conference yeah so

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,740
they really one of the things I really

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:20,010
like about your networks is they tend to

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,130
scale down very very gracefully so what

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:26,310
I am working on at the moment to run on

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:30,750
this little device is a neural network

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:34,800
that has 20,000 parameters and they're

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:37,560
8-bit each so that works to be about 20

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,620
kilobytes in the flash in the read-only

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,010
so I've got another like 44 kilobytes to

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:48,210
play with for the rest of the program

00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:49,950
and the model that I'm actually using is

00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:53,370
a very simple convolutional model it has

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:57,300
one convolutional layer it takes in a 49

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,580
by 43 one channel input image and that

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,790
input image is actually a spectrogram of

00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,910
the last one second of audio so what it

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,490
does is it runs an FFT for every sort of

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,910
like 20 milliseconds through the audio

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:14,040
data and then out of that you get this

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,170
and then it sort of squashes the FFT

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,540
down like six times so you know you have

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,910
256 buckets normally for the FFT and it

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,070
goes down to like you know 43 or

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,650
something like that so maybe four people

00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,630
aren't as familiar with DSPs and signal

00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,480
processing would be fair to say that

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,670
that's like having a histogram at time

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,960
slices just sort of rolling across in

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,240
the stream that's a great way of

00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,220
describing it a histogram showing what

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,490
the different like frequencies are

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,930
present in like each time slice right so

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,760
if you have like you know for a high

00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,100
frequency you'll get like the bucket

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,380
that's you know high up having a lot of

00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,720
having a high value and then otherwise

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,850
like low values will fill up like the

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,520
lower bucket so what's interesting is

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,500
you end up with this if you look at it

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,050
as an image you end up with this kind of

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,550
fingerprint of the noise a fingerprint

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:07,260
of the the sound that's happening and

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,480
I'd have to admit I was actually a

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,769
slightly disappointed where because I

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,739
was learning about

00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,779
how to do speech recognition and like

00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:17,519
how people do like audio recognition and

00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,800
I thought I was gonna be like learning

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,540
all of these like crazy new techniques

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,550
and there are some crazy new techniques

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,920
out there but actually just doing image

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,519
recognition like turning your audio into

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,769
a picture and then doing image

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,540
recognition using the networks that you

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,850
know and love is actually a really

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,649
effective solution so - so songs

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:42,360
yes but yeah and what gets really

00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,759
interesting is you can actually look at

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,679
using things like mobile net it has a

00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,709
very cut-down mobile net like for

00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,529
slightly larger microcontrollers you

00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:55,499
know if you can squish mobile it into

00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:57,929
250 kilobytes interesting that becomes

00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:59,879
quite an effective simple image

00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:02,189
recognition network that you can use for

00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,739
audio recognition but also potentially

00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:07,949
for things like gestures or you know

00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:10,319
sort of gaze tracking or other sort of

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:12,509
you know tasks you typically do with

00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:14,519
image recognition - distributed systems

00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,579
trusting me immediately things - is

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,009
there a way to switch between audio and

00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,679
image and then I sort of slap myself and

00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:26,339
go no it cost 50 cents you just pile if

00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:28,519
you want well I mean the other nice

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,170
thing too is that you can actually

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,540
because you're using the same your

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:37,350
network software to deal with both the

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:39,779
image and the audio it means that you

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,279
have a really simple path to just like

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,230
oh I want to pull in an image sensor

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,980
okay as long as I can just turn it into

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,660
some numbers I can feed into the network

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,480
I'm curious to you about your your

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,790
perspectives on audio I think that a lot

00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,309
of people will coming into the field of

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,379
they'll hear the word audio being used

00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:02,480
they'll think of speech to text or some

00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:04,619
sort of spoken but audio is very oddly

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,470
ubiquitous in our lives it's like we

00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:09,299
can't turn off our hearing yes and and

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,369
it has profound effects on us even if

00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,769
we're asleep on a plane the the

00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:17,399
distribution of the noise affects things

00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:19,830
like taste and digestion well one of my

00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:23,220
favorite stories is

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:24,570
I was talking to an engineering large

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,010
engineering firm and they were talking

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:32,220
about their factories where especially

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,230
their factories in Germany where every

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,210
morning they say you know there's almost

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,180
every factory there's usually you know

00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:42,960
usually a guy usually named hands who

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:45,210
walks about and he puts his hand and he

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,880
like listens to all of the machines and

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:49,050
each one he's like oh okay that one's

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,380
gonna have to go offline for some

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:53,580
servicing today and then he's like next

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,020
one he's like oh that one's gonna be

00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:59,460
okay but in a couple of weeks you're

00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:02,130
gonna want to take it off and they like

00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,930
they like every factory has one of these

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,850
like people who are really like

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,800
understands the machines and listens to

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,360
them and they're usually going to be

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,150
retiring over the next five years so

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,010
yeah so if you can actually have

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:16,560
something that's able to do that same

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,000
kind of like listening and predictive

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,710
maintenance and just kind of

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,080
understanding the world around you it

00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:24,270
doesn't have to be just sound it can be

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,580
like vibrations it can be sort of like

00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:30,630
any kind of like time-series signal and

00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:33,240
just do that very like human intuitive

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:35,130
like something doesn't sound right like

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,340
out of this really noisy data like

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:41,610
that's why I think you know attaching

00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,650
your networks these like cheap sensors

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,420
and just being able to kind of do that

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,510
kind of like oh I think something's a

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,110
bit off here interesting I can imagine

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:53,640
also for environmental changes and

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,610
adaptation have you seen the thing

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,440
recently were Finnair hired sound

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,560
designers to work with their chefs no

00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:04,830
and the idea is you actually flate your

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,830
your taste flavor profiles change based

00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,180
on high or low frequencies and so one of

00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:12,449
the reasons why airline food tastes

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:13,620
perhaps not the best and and you can

00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,880
change the soundtrack and actually

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,680
change the flavor I think there's a

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,250
chocolate shop somewhere here in London

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,709
that does tastings based on audio oh wow

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,390
[Laughter]

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,730
yeah no that's a that's a fascinating

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:29,070
idea and being able to do that sort of

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,200
sense of fusion as well because one of

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,240
the things that I ran across that I

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,870
found really interesting was

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,820
even if you're doing like speech

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,550
recognition voice recognition you can

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,470
really improve the voice recognition by

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,460
taking in video at the same time Oh

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:48,000
interesting

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:51,510
so there's a great paper that were

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,580
Google recently published about dealing

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,740
with the cocktail party effect which is

00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,360
where you know if two people are talking

00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,520
at two or more people are talking at the

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,800
same time from a microphones point of

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,480
view it just hears this babble and it's

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,180
very hard to pick out like one

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,880
individual voice but it turns out if you

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,210
have video you can actually train a

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,000
network to pull out all of the distinct

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:17,580
voices from the audio track using the

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,020
video as a sort of you know looking at

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,500
the like lip movement and things like

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,000
that and I also think you know one of

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,490
the things I struggle with with voice

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,730
interfaces is once you have multiple

00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,400
devices like the whole idea of having a

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:35,910
wake word becomes a lot more problematic

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,430
so if you can use image sensors to sort

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,300
of tell hey I'm actually looking at the

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:45,000
light switch which I want to turn on and

00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,520
then sort of like combining like image

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,960
and audio and any other senses and

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,230
actually making more sense of the world

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,590
hand movement yes gestures yes with some

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,310
types

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,950
you turn on oh that's such a fascinating

00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,240
area of design and just also so human

00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,070
almost people that dance with the

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,320
machines exactly I've always loved that

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,000
idea of sort of like the Disney Disney

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,100
world where you can actually like talk

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,800
to all these objects and they talk back

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,740
and you know you live in this happy

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,230
little alternately there's sort of the

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:22,680
the 2001 scenario of like open that pod

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:24,930
bay doors yes well they Wow okay so this

00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,590
is pure magic but it's also very real

00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:32,580
how are you accomplishing this so I'm

00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,990
getting a lot of help people in the in

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,970
the embedded world and in the

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,860
microcontroller world because you know I

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,920
really am a complete newbie when it

00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:45,360
comes to like working inside the kind of

00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,320
constraints and yeah I've had a lot of

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,820
you know hardware

00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,320
sort of partners who've been incredibly

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,420
helpful sort of you know an incredibly

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,360
patient helping me figure out how to

00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,330
like program these you know we've got a

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,620
great team working on this intensive

00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,690
flow like this is actually something

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,550
that a lot of us you know I should be

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,670
clear like this is definitely not just

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,460
me like eventually you know my teammates

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:12,640
rocky and Andy especially have been

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,500
doing some amazing work you know getting

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,130
these devices up and running and you

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:23,830
know know a lot more about it than I do

00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:26,010
but yeah we we've really been diving in

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,750
to seeing how we can strip down and

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,270
streamline tensorflow so that you can

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,970
take models that you've trained in the

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,280
cloud and in Python and they're like you

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,770
know squeeze them into a really you know

00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,080
sort of the tense flow light framework

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,440
so that you can actually run then

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,630
tensorflow light on these devices only

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,490
using like a you know a few tens of

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,370
kilobytes of memory to run the program

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:55,690
and then you know 20 kilobytes for a

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:57,280
model and it's still very early and it's

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,760
still very much a work in progress but

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,180
it's been really fascinating just seeing

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,160
how well these very modern techniques

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,770
kind of translate back to something that

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,510
feels a lot like you know the the

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:17,920
computers agent would program in the 80s

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:20,230
you know like circa 1970 80s you know

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,930
and there's no operating system per se

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:26,400
on the board no you can actually get

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,770
operating systems but this is actually

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,110
the way we run it is you know what they

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,720
call bare metal yeah where you know

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,300
you're just directly poking like memory

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,850
locations the turn LEDs on and you have

00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,160
complete control mostly because you know

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:45,730
there's so little room you want to

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,350
really make the most of but we also you

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,570
know we do work closely with like arm

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,850
and they have their own bed OS and

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:55,330
there's free artists and there's all

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,840
sorts of great sort of microcontroller

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,039
OS solutions but we're trying to

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,139
basically make it

00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:05,169
so that tensorflow is essentially just

00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:06,970
math so if we can have as few

00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:10,720
dependencies as possible and be as

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,519
portable as possible across as many OSS

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,129
and devices if we don't have to rely on

00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:17,379
iOS services like this

00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:19,059
we don't use any dynamic memory

00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,369
allocation and we don't use any of the

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:22,899
standard c library and we don't use you

00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:25,299
know so there's a lot of stuff where we

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,440
and we don't use floating-point and you

00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:30,690
know there's a whole bunch of stuff that

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:34,320
we actually avoid so that we can be as

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:37,090
fully portable to all of these different

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,710
well I mean interesting because when I

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,619
hear the word tensorflow my immediate

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,720
thought is some ginormous cluster

00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:46,479
running in the cloud some huge data

00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,970
center and and just fantastic networking

00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:52,179
and all going on and this is as far away

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,789
as that as conceivable have there been

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,899
learnings by working the small have

00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:59,139
there been learnings that factored back

00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:02,320
into tensor foot proper yeah and what I

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:04,389
find really interesting is the more we

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,549
strip it down the more we get to sort of

00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:09,759
like the essentials of what's kind of

00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:12,099
required to do these networks so you

00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,499
know a good example of this is we've

00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:17,590
done a lot of work on the mobile in an

00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:21,009
embedded team on running your networks

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,049
in 8-bit so actually getting down to

00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,909
sort of you know instead of doing 32-bit

00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,759
float for all your values actually do

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:31,210
things as sort of 8-bit integers because

00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:35,019
a lot of these devices are much better

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:37,119
at doing 8-bit math and 32-bit but that

00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:40,359
actually translates back nicely to a lot

00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:42,029
of these server and the you know some of

00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,769
the cloud like Nvidia have some great

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:46,659
tends to RT sort of 8-bit solutions

00:23:44,769 --> 00:23:49,029
Intel have some great code for doing

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:51,009
8-bit stuff so the work we've been doing

00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:54,129
on the training side to help train

00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:56,590
networks to run an 8-bit precision

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:58,899
because they need to be sort of modified

00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,059
so that they can handle the lack of

00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:05,169
precision has then sort of fed back into

00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:07,269
some of the you know the cloud sort of

00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:09,820
deployment and the cloud training stuff

00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:11,470
so there's been a lot of you know it

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,090
still we're still very much part of the

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,980
main tense

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,140
hello team and there's you know it's is

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,909
a lot of really productive back and

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,279
forth that happens when you're running

00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:23,669
all the way from tiny chips like these

00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,880
up to sort of crazy you know TPU yeah

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,840
exactly I was thinking like a large

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,559
ensembles of teepees

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:34,770
well another question I have is sort of

00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,600
seeing looking ahead and seeing the

00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,419
future through your eyes I'm really

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,220
curious because it's coming from a Riley

00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:43,200
what we're hearing a lot on the ground

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,580
that I don't think is fully appreciated

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,470
as much in the industry is just how

00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,360
dramatic the hardware changes are that

00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:55,590
are coming down the pipe and what the

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,210
consequence is on AI data in general it

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,649
seems like this is a game changer to get

00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,320
a device like this out in the real world

00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:03,659
well the nice thing is that they were

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,110
already like 10 billion of devices like

00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,730
this being sold every year and more more

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,260
like more and more every year there's

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,169
like tens of billions of these out there

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:15,050
already so the hardware is kind of

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:23,970
sitting there waiting for us

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:23,970
[Laughter]

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:31,529
waiting for us to actually get these

00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:33,240
things running on there so and there is

00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,789
a lot of really exciting new hardware

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,350
coming out to in this world which is

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:40,110
going to make things even better but

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,610
even if we can just run with what's out

00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,250
there already I think there's some

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,320
really fascinating ways that we can

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,470
improve sort of products and improve

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:53,429
people's lives and then if we can if the

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:56,399
hardware is even better then you know we

00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:58,950
can do even more so it strikes me I

00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:02,640
remember a conversation right around the

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:06,029
dot-com crash I mean showing my age no

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,980
no I was bit you know I remember

00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:09,690
conversations somebody was was saying

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,149
this for this striking thing about a lot

00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:14,070
of dark web their dark fiber that was

00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:15,750
out in the world I was being brought up

00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:17,580
and possibly could use and other people

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:22,049
were arguing and saying well there's

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:23,210
really no need to transfer that much how

00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,820
on earth did somebody really

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,620
that a business use case yeah and here

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,630
we've got a similar kind of thing with a

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,640
lot of I won't say dark hardware a bit I

00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:35,120
mean it's late it's yet its latent

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,710
compute that's kind of not doing

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,919
anything right now and could be doing

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,500
some really useful stuff so fantastic

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,460
and and also just I mean going back to

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:49,070
the physics of edge and cloud and IOT

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,539
and all that it's a hard problem to take

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:52,460
called water data and send it up to the

00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:54,020
cloud and yeah bring it back down and

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,799
make any kind of judgment within

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,330
microseconds yeah the latency is a

00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,159
really important use case for doing

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,470
things on like mobile phones and on the

00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,899
edge but the other thing that we find is

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:08,529
if you look at you know something like

00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:11,179
serial okay Google

00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:13,760
it's essential that you have something

00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:17,149
running on the device to wake the device

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,690
up but then it actually sends a lot more

00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,580
traffic to the cloud so it's not like

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,980
these are and you know the cloud in the

00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,710
air during competition we see like the

00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,020
more intelligence you get at the edge

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,419
the more chance you have to do things

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,700
that the cloud level as well to really

00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:36,620
use it yeah it's really use it well to

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,590
use it efficiently but even like if you

00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,659
think about it you couldn't have

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:45,080
launched something like Siri without

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:47,899
having on device and cloud right yeah

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,760
you know capability so if the on device

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,470
capability hadn't existed the cloud

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,970
capability would never have been like

00:27:51,470 --> 00:28:00,230
you know used so interesting interesting

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:02,360
so a I mean what what that portends is

00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,730
that there's a lot more these kinds of

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:09,020
applications we haven't envisioned yet

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,260
yes and also design patterns they yeah

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,779
interact like now that we have the

00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,700
ability to recognize gestures and to

00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,929
recognize you know starting to be able

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,289
to do a much better job recognizing

00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,270
speech and you know gaze and all of

00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:25,429
these things like how can you sort of

00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:28,429
interact with objects in the world in a

00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,750
very natural way where you know if there

00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:31,580
was another person sitting across from

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,639
you they would know what you were

00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:37,510
talking about so why you know why

00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:37,510
doesn't your toaster

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,650
