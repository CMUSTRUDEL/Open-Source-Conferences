we'd like to take a few minutes to give

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,480
an overview of the state of automation

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,059
technologies we'll try to highlight a

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,429
few areas where applications can be

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,750
built today and sketch out how these

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,090
tools may evolve over the near term

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,760
first let's look at adoption earlier

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,630
this year we did a survey which garnered

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,820
over 11,000 respondents we basically

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,070
wanted to find out how enterprises were

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,349
using machine learning and what we found

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,860
is that many companies are in fact still

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,020
in the early stages of adoption and we

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,670
also found that one of the main things

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,590
holding companies back is lack of

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,629
skilled people or a skills gap the good

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,390
news is that developers have taken heed

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,300
in this growing demand in our own online

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,170
learning platform Safari which has over

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,090
2.1 million subscribers we are seeing a

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,239
strong growth in usage in all topics

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,820
related to AI and machine learning so

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,530
for example you can see here

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,460
double-digit growth in people reading

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:10,560
about tensorflow but we are also seeing

00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:13,130
really strong growth in new top tools

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,299
and topics including pie charts and

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,920
reinforcement learning both of which

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,530
were subjects of tutorials yesterday now

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,900
a recent survey of close to 4,000 IT

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,479
leaders across 84 countries found that

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,310
more and more companies are no surprise

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,220
starting to invest in AI automation

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,619
technologies but the level of investment

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,000
really depends on the company and in

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,100
particular the companies that already

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,200
consider themselves to be digital

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,509
leaders tend to report a much higher

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,570
level of investment in AI in machine

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,159
learning location matters too given the

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,860
highly competitive business environment

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,420
China we're seeing that companies there

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,700
also tend to invest at a much higher

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,140
clip so recent progress in AI and

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,680
machine learning has been fueled by

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,420
growth in data compute and models so

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,990
let's briefly examine each of these

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,000
elements so let's look at deep learning

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,730
so the resurgence in deep learning

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,190
happened around 2011 2012 with record

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,650
setting models in speech in computer

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,019
vision in fact when I first began

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,290
following the deep learning community in

00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:27,230
2013 that community was still relatively

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,480
small you actually had to do an

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,819
internship in a few groups scattered

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,360
across the world a lot of the knowledge

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:39,349
was in the form of oral tradition today

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,360
that community is much much larger now

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:43,069
progress research has been made possible

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,860
by a few things namely the study

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,920
improvement in datasets but also a

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,870
hardware and software tools specifically

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,760
easy to use open source libraries for

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,489
machine learning have really leveled the

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,079
playing field these open source ml

00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,459
libraries have made it possible for even

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:00,590
non expert developers to build

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,569
interesting applications in fact last

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,510
year in 2017 we featured a couple of

00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:06,829
teenagers at our us AI conferences where

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,069
they were self-taught and they were able

00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:14,000
to build potentially high-impact

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:16,640
prototypes involving deep learning so

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,500
now companies have taken notice and a

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,849
lot of them now want to really start

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,970
getting serious and building and

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:25,549
deploying ml and AI systems into their

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,980
products in 2015

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:30,290
LinkedIn conducted a survey in the US

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,359
and they found that there was at that

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,760
time at least a surplus of data

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,819
scientists today that's no longer the

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:40,160
case demand for data scientists in key

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,889
metropolitan areas in the u.s. is very

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,410
high and we believe actually this will

00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:49,700
continue to spread to other industries

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:52,370
and other geographies in the future with

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,590
that said having great models isn't

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,750
sufficient at least for now

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,519
many of the models we rely on including

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,440
deep learning and reinforcement learning

00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,750
are extremely data hungry now since they

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,900
since they have the potential to scale

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,599
to many many users the large companies

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,549
in the large countries has seemingly

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,919
have an advantage over the rest of us

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:20,419
for example China in particular has been

00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,640
dubbed the Saudi Arabia of data that's

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:24,620
right in because AI research depends so

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,360
heavily on access to the large data sets

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,620
we're seeing more and more cutting-edge

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,080
research coming out of

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,669
US and Chinese companies nips for

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,919
example as some of you might know or

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,870
remember used to be a bit of a sleepy

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,180
academic conference but now it sells out

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,830
within minutes and we're seeing more and

00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,770
more papers coming from these large US

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,360
and Chinese companies the good news is

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,240
that there are many new tools that might

00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,790
help the rest of us gain more access to

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,680
more data namely services for generating

00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,690
labelled data sets are increasingly

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,639
using add technologies the ones that

00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,380
rely on human laborers are beginning to

00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,600
use machine learning tools to help their

00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,120
human workers scale and improve accuracy

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,850
and in certain domains exciting new

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,370
tools like Gans and simulation platforms

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,350
are able to provide realistic synthetic

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,360
data which can be used for training

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,979
machine learning models we'll have a few

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,570
of these sessions to cover some of these

00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,740
topics at this conference in fact so

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,979
definitely feel free to check it out

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,919
this is a generating data another

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,389
important aspect is sharing data and my

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,910
co-chair here Roger is going to give a

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:31,070
great talk tomorrow about the rise of

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:33,110
new data networks for sharing we are in

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,810
the seventh year of this renewed

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,820
interest in AI and deep learning and if

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,820
you fall if you follow the history of

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,220
computer architecture typically you want

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,610
to figure out what sort of computations

00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,830
you need to do and decide whether or not

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,410
you have enough scale and at this point

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,870
it seems like we do have enough scale to

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,169
start building specialized hardware for

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,550
AI and machine learning

00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,530
now machine learning researchers are

00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,820
constantly exploring new algorithms and

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,070
in the case of deep learning this

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,289
usually means trying new neural network

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,020
architectures we're finding parameters

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,300
or exploring new optimization techniques

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,060
the challenge is that experience can

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,780
take a long time to complete hours days

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,229
or sometimes even weeks but help is on

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,510
the way

00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,669
numerous hardware startups are targeting

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,070
deep learning both in China in the US as

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,780
well as out here in the UK with

00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,180
companies like graph core which will be

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,070
a speaker at this event the SF Bay area

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,050
in particular though is a hotbed for

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,849
experienced hardware engineers and

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,400
entrepreneurs many of whom are working

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:39,020
on a I related startups and as you can

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,330
see many of the hardware stirrups are

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,039
targeting edge devices

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,050
we know about the opportunities in

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:50,000
monitoring but the market for inference

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:52,520
is also going to be enormous now we've

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,919
talked about data models and compute

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,139
mainly in the context of traditional

00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:58,009
performance measurements namely

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,440
optimizing machine learning or even

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:02,360
business metrics but the reality is that

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,550
there are many other considerations for

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,500
example in certain domains including

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,620
health and finance systems need to be

00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,479
explainable this is a real concern for

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,240
many companies and in a recent survey we

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,860
found lots of awareness and concern over

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,449
these issues on a part of data

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,099
scientists and did engineers so while we

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:24,590
can start building interesting

00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,680
applications today we need to remember

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,599
that a lot of these machine learning

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,990
models can still be brittle so I'm sure

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,669
all of us have read examples of computer

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:40,159
vision systems that seemingly fail under

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,360
reasonable conditions so the thing to

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,710
remember is there's actually two

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,529
dimensions here right so there's

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,960
efficiency efficiency provided by

00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,370
automation but in certain domains you

00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,909
really need to take into account

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,669
reliability as well so the founders of

00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,560
mobile I described it best right so the

00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,620
main parameter in the race for

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,759
autonomous cars cannot be who will have

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:07,430
the first car on the road

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:10,699
developing safe fair and secure AI

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:13,490
applications will happen in stages so

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,039
you and you can look at the technologies

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,099
available today they may not get you to

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,590
full automation but you can start

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,529
thinking about partial automation so you

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,289
need not adopt an all-or-nothing

00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,479
attitude so one of the things to

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,409
remember it's really hard to predict how

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:36,229
these technologies will play out in fact

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:39,440
in Silicon Valley were base we even have

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,709
an informal law Firdous called Amara's

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,449
law named after roy amara the co-founder
