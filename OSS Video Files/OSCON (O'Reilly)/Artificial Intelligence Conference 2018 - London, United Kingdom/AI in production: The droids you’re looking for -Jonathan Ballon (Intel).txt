Title: AI in production: The droids you’re looking for -Jonathan Ballon (Intel)
Publication date: 2018-10-10
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Artificial intelligence in the future, at least represented in science fiction, can learn, interpret, and take action based on data analysis. AI in production is the present, a present that feels decidedly futuristic. AI is transforming the IoT at the edge: improving healthcare outcomes through more accurate diagnoses, automating factory assembly lines, reducing traffic congestion in smart cities, and much more.

Enhancing the IoT with AI will directly create new products and services; without AI, data from the deployments will have limited value. Jonathan Ballon explains why Intel’s leading portfolio of AI and computer vision edge technology will drive advances in machine learning, accelerate natural language processing, and create opportunities to monitor and inspect where humans can’t—improving how we work and live.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,029
if you have small kids you may know

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:08,069
Wally this is a Pixar movie from only

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,790
ten years ago and this little guy

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:16,080
basically his job is to cruise around a

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,600
post utopian world and clean up the

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
trash and he has been doing this for

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,800
seven hundred years on solar power and

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,449
the way he does this is through computer

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,490
vision technology he has the ability to

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,619
identify things that are trash and not

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:33,620
trash and sort them appropriately put

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:36,210
him into his chest and compact them but

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,700
it's only been ten years and you know

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,559
this is no longer that far off I mean

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,190
here's a customer of ours hikvision

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,670
which is a leading AI company in China

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,719
and this Factory that they've automated

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,670
with these little robots ships about 15

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,910
million dollars worth of product every

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,699
single day and by automating the entire

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,699
sorting process they've reduced their

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,680
cost by 80% and at the same time they've

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,400
increased the efficiency of this

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,680
particular warehouse by 60% there used

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
to be just hundreds of workers in this

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,630
building and they completely retrofitted

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,060
it to enable these cute little robots

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,170
that are operating entirely autonomously

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,750
using computer vision optical sensors on

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,880
the robot to help them determine where

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,119
they are and understanding where they

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,259
need to be pretty cool here's another

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:38,009
example The Terminator the t800 whose

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,700
primary directive is to destroy humanity

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,000
by finding Sarah Connor and eliminating

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,040
her before she can give birth to her son

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,640
also a user and fan of computer vision

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,670
technology what the Terminator also has

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,799
is natural language processing so he has

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,560
the ability to communicate and he's got

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,990
a neural net processor CPU which enables

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,439
him to be a fully functional cybernetic

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,969
organism what some of our customers are

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,680
doing rather than destroy humanity

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,979
they're trying to save humanity by

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,740
seeking out to destroy diseases in this

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,540
case GE healthcare is using

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:22,410
and production to be able to understand

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:25,980
highly complex CT MRI PET scan sonogram

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,170
mammogram images and what's really

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,850
important is that you know these types

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,470
of images can't be compressed they

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,230
really have to be looking at the full

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,690
res image in order to get the depth and

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,970
the complexity of the image that they're

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,540
looking at in the case of GE they

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:45,030
leveraged a tool kit from Intel along

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,850
with xeon processors and they're now

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,680
getting 16 times better performance on

00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:54,420
intel architecture than they were

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,490
getting prior and pretty interesting

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,620
case study that has an impact on

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,260
everyone's lives and of course no

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,880
conversation of droids would be complete

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:08,130
without c-3po and r2d2 c-3po also

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,800
computer vision user fluent in six

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,170
million forms of communication and also

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,380
uses machine learning to detect people's

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:21,000
emotions in the case of r2d2 an

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:25,070
astromech droid used to transport secret

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,960
rebel communications as well as repair

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:30,180
starships operates in low-power mode

00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,700
very important in fact what you're

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,080
seeing here is a lot of these droids

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,940
because they're operating outside of a

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,660
data center they do require low-power

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,130
and they do require high degrees of

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,230
computational capabilities to handle all

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,030
of the inference that's coming in

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:48,690
through the variety of sensors that they

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,410
have and so what we see is that vision

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,200
is becoming almost the ultimate IOT

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,860
sensor and it's transforming every

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,420
industry so in retail we're using

00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:03,330
computer vision technology to allow for

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,160
staff 'less stores so now in the u.s.

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,760
it's Amazon go that's rolling these out

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:11,010
in China it's JD comm and now shoppers

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,950
have basically the ability to replicate

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,670
the online experience offline which

00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,590
means online it's a one-click purchase

00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,540
customized and personalized for your

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,010
individual needs in the case of a staff

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,480
'less store you walk in you take

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,670
whatever you want off the shelf and you

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,850
walk out there is no check

00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:32,670
process we're gonna talk about a couple

00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,850
of industrial cases in transportation

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,670
computer vision technology is going into

00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,470
vehicles with gaze control so you can

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,350
understand if the driver is distracted

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,890
and looking at their phone or if they're

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:51,720
in fact dozing off hugely important for

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,270
safety in smart cities digital security

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,070
and surveillance has been the key

00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,950
workload or use case for computer vision

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,590
technology particularly here in London

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,110
which led the way with a completely

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,660
blanketed security system across the

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,360
city that allows city operators to

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,820
actually track people and vehicles from

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,890
camera to camera in a networked way but

00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,290
it's gone way beyond just security and

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:20,280
surveillance now cameras are being used

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:23,640
to help automate traffic situations to

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,550
automate the parking situation and

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,870
really help with pedestrian movement and

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,870
