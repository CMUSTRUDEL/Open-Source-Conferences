Title: The missing piece- Cassie Kozyrkov (Google)
Publication date: 2018-10-11
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Why do businesses fail at machine learning despite its tremendous potential and the excitement it generates? Is the answer always in data, algorithms, and infrastructure, or is there a subtler problem? Will things improve in the near future? Cassie Kozyrkov shares lessons learned at Google and explains what they mean for applied data science.

	00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,720
so with all of that incredible potential

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,840
and with that future why do businesses

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,429
fail at machine learning well I think

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,250
it's because the world doesn't realize

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,609
that there's actually two ai's here even

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,650
though we tend to make it sound like one

00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:24,060
there is the research side of things and

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:28,019
the applied side of things now research

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,330
AI is a lot like building microwaves

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,579
building general purpose tools for other

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,739
people to go cook with to go solve their

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,840
business problems with and that is what

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,750
all of our university courses are about

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,540
they teach us the underlying math of how

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,860
these things tick because frankly how

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,710
are you gonna build a better microwave

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,320
if you don't know how this one works so

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,090
that's the right thing to know if you

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,379
want to be in the business of selling

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:59,190
microwaves research but now that this

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,960
stuff is potentially pretty useful a lot

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,489
of folks out there just want to get

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,439
cooking they want to be in a different

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,880
business they want to serve things to

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,780
their customers in restaurants they

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,090
wanted to apply to AI and yet for some

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,040
reason we seem to be telling them go

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,680
take all the same courses go learn how

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:22,140
to wire your own microwaves before you

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:24,270
can cook very strange especially since

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,770
if you're going to open an industrial

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,159
scale kitchen if you're gonna run

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,810
something like McDonald's even if you

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,210
didn't have to wire your own microwaves

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,890
this still an awful lot that you would

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,320
need to know now it also happens that

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,030
thanks to all those research efforts

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:51,390
there are warehouses upon warehouses

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:54,090
these microwaves out there and yet the

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,299
emphasis is still on rebuilding from

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,640
scratch if you want to cook and what I

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,090
see teams doing well business teams

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,640
doing is hiring a bunch of folks who are

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,620
researchers so think of that as

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,160
engineers who've spent their entire life

00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,560
perfect advancing some small component

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,620
in that microwave and grab a team of

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,660
these folks they open an industrial

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,660
scale kitchen they ask these folks to

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,440
run that kitchen what could possibly go

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,260
wrong

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,120
right now if it doesn't go wrong I

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:34,560
shouldn't pat themselves on the back for

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,740
good planning that's luck they hired

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,530
engineers who just so happened to also

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,630
be great chips sure sometimes research

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,390
folk and I myself have a research

00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,820
background originally sometimes they

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:50,700
look around and they start to see that

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,880
appliance side as interesting and then

00:02:50,700 --> 00:03:01,080
they go and master the entire whole

00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:04,650
discipline around application now what

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,830
is the actual hiring plan there there is

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,440
there one by what mechanism are we

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,370
guaranteeing that attempting to train

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,000
and hire a bunch of microwave builders

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:20,550
is going to help us actually cook as

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,489
reliability engineers at Google say hope

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,590
is not a strategy just hoping that you

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,970
hire a researcher and they transcend

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:34,590
into the applied stuff that's a pretty

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:38,070
risky proposition there and yet most of

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:43,260
the training out there is all about how

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:46,110
to build more more more microwaves we

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,800
should be talking about this but we're

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,489
not instead we're just encouraging the

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,110
world to go and start from scratch

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,470
learn how electricity works learn how

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,510
wiring works

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:04,200
nothing oriented on the actual cooking

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,120
at scale which again even if you don't

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,510
have to wire your own microwaves is not

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,510
