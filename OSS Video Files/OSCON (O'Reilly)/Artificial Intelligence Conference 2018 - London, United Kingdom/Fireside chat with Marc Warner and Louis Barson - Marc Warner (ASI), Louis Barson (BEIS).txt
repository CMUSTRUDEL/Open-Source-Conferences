what do you think is holding us back at

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,569
the moment those that the complete

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,040
solution so it's a really good question

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,269
I mean there's there's many many

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,759
barriers that we still need to address

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,170
and actually the Cossack review that

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,900
some Jim has been leading has started

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,130
sort of surface some of those barriers

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,380
and now these are these are barriers for

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,410
gov tech companies but they apply to AI

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,910
in particular so firms in the sector say

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,800
they often find access to finance more

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,830
difficult in comparable funds because

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,060
investors don't necessarily understand

00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,050
the use cases of alien government or

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,160
don't have confidence in the great

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,329
potential of a sort of government

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,219
focused business model firms say they

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,320
find difficulty accessing government

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,079
data because well we know that about 80%

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
of data in the world is not easily

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,250
amenable to AI analysis and that goes

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,690
just as well for government data you

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,879
know even data sets like the NHS which

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,809
are crown jewels as we found through you

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,730
know the Moorfields pilots etc and then

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,949
in the date sets of course the issues of

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,690
diversity and bias become to the floor

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,489
and then there's a bunch of sort of

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,379
demand signed issues as well so there's

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,510
uncertainty about the the regulatory

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,090
environments there's uncertainty about

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,619
sort of public trust you know will

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,990
public at the end of the day come to

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,970
come to know and trust government by AI

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,439
is a really important question

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,180
there's doubts about sort of

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,369
government's ability to deliver the

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,170
technical pasty in infrastructure and

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,460
you know there are some some reasons for

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,570
those doubts but we hope things are

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,400
moving in a positive direction

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,810
and there's of course you know just the

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,799
mechanics of how public procurement

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,270
works and in particular how it works for

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,390
small companies and we know that's a

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,860
challenge so there are sort of you know

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,720
starts at solutions to a lot of those

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,000
issues for instance the small business

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,439
research initiative has been focused on

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,200
trying to get more innovative small

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,060
businesses you know addressing

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,740
government problems and and trying to

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,110
ensure the government problems are more

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,140
easily accessible to businesses so they

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,340
can start to to try to address them but

00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,469
I think overall so one of the amazing

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,450
things about AI is that it can deliver

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,750
transformational change not just

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,560
incremental change and that's also it's

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,600
a bit of a double-edged sword because

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,489
that can make people nervous you know

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,170
might be get difficult to go back if if

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,640
things don't work so it's really

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,110
important that we as the UK in

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,710
particular sort of move forwards

00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,480
with ethics and with safe and secure

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,550
implementation at the heart of part of

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,990
what we do and I think we've we've made

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,610
a start on that in terms of the way in

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,130
which we've progressed some of the AI

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,600
pilots and we've sort of concretize that

00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,190
through the establishment of the Center

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,070
for data ethics and innovation as part

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,320
of the AI sector deal so this is a an

00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:37,990
advisory body to government that will

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,880
deal with some of the big tricky

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,740
challenges around Gosford intelligence

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,940
and data implementation and they will

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,110
sort of you know make some

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,490
recommendations to government on how we

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,900
could move forwards in the

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,120
implementation of AI which we all know

00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,220
is really important but do is do so in

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,220
