	00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,820
so great to be here I wanted to just

00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,460
share a little bit with you about what

00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,940
we're seeing in the adoption of AI and

00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:12,070
machine learning at AWS both from the

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,590
perspective of usage within other parts

00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,059
of Amazon but also with the large number

00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:19,029
of external customers that we're working

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,039
with in this field right now as you

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,140
might know Amazon has been using machine

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,090
learning technologies pretty much since

00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,500
day one I guess it quite a few of you

00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,660
will have visited a website called

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,580
amazon.com and you maybe even bought

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,160
something on there and maybe you've used

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,410
the recommended for you or customers

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,540
that bought this also bought this item

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,149
features which are both long-standing

00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,790
examples of vectorization machines

00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:44,829
deployed within a service which is very

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,210
widely used by Amazon retail customers

00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,969
and of course that tradition of

00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,129
innovation continues today with things

00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:54,160
like Amazon go the checkout --less

00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:56,350
cashier free retail experience that we

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,600
recently opened in Seattle and that

00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,190
we're in the process of expanding to

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,930
other cities in North America right now

00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,720
this uses machine learning based

00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,850
computer vision sensor fusion in the

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,650
built retail environment to enable

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,600
customers to purchase without

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,030
interacting with any store staff simply

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,950
walk in pick up the product you want and

00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,509
walk out again and in a few seconds

00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,369
you'll get a push notification to your

00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,560
phone telling you what you've purchased

00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,000
and charging your Amazon account for

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,290
whatever products you can move so it's a

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,990
really friction-free

00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:28,150
experience for customers another similar

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,460
example of course is the Amazon echo

00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,100
powered by the Alexa voice service which

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:36,369
pioneered a new form of human-computer

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,990
interaction just use your voice ask the

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:39,939
system the product for whatever it is

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,460
you want an Alexa will figure out what

00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:43,869
you need return answers to you fast

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,049
enough for it to sound like you're

00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:49,000
interacting with the human being really

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,579
important services and products for our

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,189
customers built using the same kind of

00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:57,159
technology that AWS makes available to

00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:59,229
its customers so I just wanted to dig

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,969
into what some of the important

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,710
characteristics are in building

00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:04,750
applications of this type in my role I

00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,689
work primarily with software developers

00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,340
and software developers are highly

00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,349
focused on building products and apps

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,060
and in doing that in the AI and machine

00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:13,840
learning space there are three core

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,940
areas that we

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
think fundamentally important to

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,080
software developers they're building

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,410
these kinds of applications the first is

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,599
that data is the fuel that drives the ML

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,360
engine for app developers of all types

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,790
and collecting data has never been

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,310
easier or cheaper than it is today

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,220
thanks to hyper scale cloud platforms

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,980
like AWS it's very easy to ingest and

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,989
store data at high scale regardless of

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,299
whether that data comes from a physical

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:45,040
device in the IOT domain or it comes

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,829
from an application you want to have the

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,560
ability to reliably store and aggregate

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,989
data at stea scale with the right kind

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,940
of control characteristics and also the

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:56,920
ability to bring in different types of

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,110
processing application to that data

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,420
might be machine learning it might be

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,760
more traditional analytics but having

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,980
all of your data in one location makes

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,799
that really simple to do you can also

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,319
annotate data of course you've it using

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,840
services like the Mechanical Turk I saw

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,400
on a slide just a second ago providing

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,650
the capability to apply human

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,819
intelligence to live link tasks you can

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,230
do that with data stored in AWS as well

00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,389
the second and probably most important

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,359
thing is that developers are not

00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:30,010
ubiquitous or uniform in their focus and

00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,620
if you talk to software developers that

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,940
are building ml applications you'll find

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,130
that they broadly fall into three

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,200
different categories experts like a lot

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,540
of the attendees here today are really

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,269
interested in running known frameworks

00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,280
often open source tools in a highly

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,349
optimized performance and cost efficient

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,950
way and for that you want access to high

00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,230
performance GPU or CPU capacity with the

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,200
right type of integration and simplicity

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,760
to use the cloud for those purposes

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,859
secondly platforms which I'll return to

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,440
return to in a second and then finally

00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:04,000
very simple to access application

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,700
services that just make it really easy

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,440
for developers to incorporate human-like

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,200
characteristics that are delivered by

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,780
pre trained models directly into their

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,010
apps for things like image recognition

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,070
natural language understanding or

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,169
conversational interfaces in the area of

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,969
platforms what we're focused on here is

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:24,490
helping developers iterate really

00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:25,870
rapidly on their own models and for this

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,700
we announced the service last year

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,130
called Amazon sage maker

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,590
provides an end-to-end tool chain for

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,480
developing training testing and

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,220
optimizing machine learning models and

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,260
then deploying those into production

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,340
with elasticity and failure tolerant

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,080
characteristics and we've made a lot of

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,240
optimizations with sage made maker to

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,910
improve the algorithms that are the core

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,830
of this service simple things well they

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,870
sound simple like keep making it

00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:55,630
possible to train on streaming data or

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,220
to incrementally update a model based on

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,990
new data samples that you have without

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,490
having to do a complete from scratch

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,740
training job these are things that we've

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,200
built into sage Maker at launch and

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,820
iterated on since roughly a year ago

00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,640
when we launched the service and the

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,710
reason for this is ml model development

00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,140
is actually very similar to other

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,360
software development activities it's all

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,580
about iteration it's all about rapid

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,980
experimentation getting a new version of

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,980
the model out there tested so that you

00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,540
can iterate and improve upon that and to

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,460
this end we have some very specific

00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,620
features within sage maker that are

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,170
intended to improve the speed of the

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,000
development process training on a local

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,470
notebook on a laptop and then uplifting

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,240
that environment then using something

00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,890
that is exactly consistent with high

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,320
performance computing resources within

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,330
the cloud and that encompasses the

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,580
ability to scale out across large

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,500
numbers of node which materially

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,810
improves the speed at which external

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,670
developers can build models and also the

00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,010
speed at which developers within Amazon

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:58,540
can achieve some of these results with

00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:00,160
services like Alexa and Amazon go so

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,750
hope you'll take a look at other

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,570
customers that have already made the

00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,640
decision to use AWS for their ml and AI

00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,050
workloads and we have tens of thousands

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,120
of customers that are doing that today

00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,250
if you want to learn more about these

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,450
and also more about the services that

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,340
I've talked about in this quick

00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,920
presentation this morning you can find

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,260
us on the internet of course at ml dot

00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,329
AWS thank you

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,329
