Title: Notes from the frontier: Making AI work - Michael Chui (McKinsey Global Institute)
Publication date: 2018-10-11
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Drawing on the McKinsey Global Instituteâ€™s groundbreaking research, Michael Chui explores commonly asked questions relating to AI and its impact on work, including: How big is the AI opportunity? Which sectors and functions can capture the most value? As AI takes hold, will there be enough jobs for humans? What will they be, and what skills are needed? What are the implications for leaders? Michael also previews new research showing that despite the rapid pace of AI adoption, much foundational work in enterprises remains to be done to capture value at scale.

	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,470
we've actually surveyed for two years

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,560
now now you know those of us who are in

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,670
software know that you know we have

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,889
questions about the degree to which we

00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,019
want to have backward compatibility well

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,030
we asked a certain set of questions in

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,500
2017 we asked a slightly different set

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,100
of questions so they're not perfectly

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,380
comparable but in 2017 we did identify

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,140
you know out of thousands of executives

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,349
that we surveyed roughly 20% of

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,810
companies had either deployed AI at

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,550
scale or in a core business process now

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,110
we didn't ask exactly the same questions

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,550
this year but we think if they're

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,770
roughly comparable and that said about

00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:42,690
50% of companies now or 50% of our

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,420
respondents say that their companies

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,570
have deployed AI and embedded it in

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,730
standard operating processes within at

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,469
least one business unit or function so

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,910
not exactly the same question but you

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,920
know that twenty and fifty percent are

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,390
roughly comparable and the top-line is

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,850
definitely incomparable right in terms

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,830
of anyone who's done anything including

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,869
piloting going from 62 to 61 to 77% so

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,869
we are seeing what we view as

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,240
accelerating adoption of this technology

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,939
and in fact if you try to add it if you

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,710
try we did dry we ask where have you

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,720
actually deployed these technologies and

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,729
we've cut it near by industry sector

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
we've cut it by use cases we have a lot

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,590
of detailed data but I'm gonna share

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,900
just one finding here fortunately it

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,409
looks like that corporate executives are

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,170
deploying AI where there's the where the

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,750
most value can be found so again if you

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,579
think again the the the vertical lines

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,640
are different functions within the

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,310
enterprise look you know where has

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,229
service ops where has AI been deployed

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,850
most in service ops in the telecom

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,130
sector that makes sense there are a lot

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,490
of surface ops questions in telecom in

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,229
product development hi-tech is the the

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,909
sector which leads there that makes

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,590
sense because by the way when we talked

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,659
about product development that included

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,640
embedding AI into products and services

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,610
so that that's primal er what did there

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,099
as opposed to AI taking the place of of

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,629
engineers marketing sales in retail that

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,400
makes perfect sense as well as the same

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,610
with supply chain and then you know

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,680
manufacturing being

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,990
you know one of the places where AI has

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,540
been adopted in automotive and assembly

00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,610
also makes sense and then also risk in

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,980
financial services so in some ways

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,960
there's a tremendously good story about

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,330
the way that AI has been adopted already

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,250
even in I'll describe it as short

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,460
history although we all know that AI is

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:36,790
you know over a half a century old but

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,890
in terms of this recent wave of AI we do

00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,150
see it you know the acceleration and

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,709
adoption and secondly primarily being

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,660
adopted in places where it can drive the

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,260
most value at least at the level of

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,260
