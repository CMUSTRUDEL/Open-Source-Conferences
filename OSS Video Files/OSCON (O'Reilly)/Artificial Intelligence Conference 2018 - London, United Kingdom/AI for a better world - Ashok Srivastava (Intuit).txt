	00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,750
now let's switch to economic disparity

00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:07,850
you know the fact is that there are so

00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,980
many things that are happening in the

00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:13,099
world today that are due to the fact

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,589
that there is economic disparity around

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,869
us it doesn't take a lot to see that as

00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:20,420
we stroll around in the world we see

00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,789
that all around us the question is as AI

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,099
practitioners do you and I have the

00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:27,500
ability to influence that in some way

00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,840
well this is why I joined into it

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,060
because it's a company that has put

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,150
powering prosperity around the world as

00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,580
its ultimate mission and as it a person

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,800
who thinks about ways that we can help

00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,990
Society this was something extremely

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,310
compelling to me and something that I

00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,470
really value as a member of that team so

00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:52,370
let's just think about how this might

00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:55,040
work quickbooks capital is a technique

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,100
it's a it's a it's an offering that we

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,270
have built at Intuit that allows people

00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:05,900
to take out personal loans for their

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,820
small business in the setting where they

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,270
might actually not be able to get those

00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,030
loans from financial institutions let's

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,650
step back a second and think about the

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:21,560
overall situation that economically we

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,150
find if you look at SBIR data small

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,420
business data from the United States

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,610
that about half of small businesses fail

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,230
in their first five years this is from

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,510
the Bureau of Labor Statistics and

00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,810
eighty-two percent of small businesses

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,120
failed because of cash flow issues what

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,310
that means is that people are working

00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,600
and they're trying to pay the bills

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,630
they're trying to run their small

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,610
businesses and yet because of some error

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,220
for instance and their ability to

00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,720
forecast what's going to happen next

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,900
with respect to their cash flow 82% of

00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,900
small businesses fail now I'm going to

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,299
tie this back to that aviation issue

00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,640
that I talked about a moment ago they're

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:06,260
very similar and this is the kind of

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,270
discipline that I try to bring in my

00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,160
teams try to bring as we think about

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,260
artificial intelligence and its

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,349
application across a number of different

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,299
domains

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,760
what I find so compelling in that

00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,890
airplane incident that I described to

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,440
you is that we had the ability to

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:26,830
forecast and look into the future and

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,190
say 20 to 30 flights from now there's

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,569
going to be an engine failure right here

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,120
what we're trying to do is build

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,700
technology that says not 20 to 30

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,819
flights from now but maybe 20 to 30

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,040
months from now or 20 to 30 days from

00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:46,930
now this small business might actually

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,930
be in a poor cash flow situation that

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,750
could lead to an economic distress for

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,239
them a financial distress for them it's

00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,849
exactly actually exactly the same

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,340
problem and this is what I find so

00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:03,940
compelling about this type of work when

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,579
you see that there is a constant stream

00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,579
of data technology and people that tie

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:12,849
together all of these variants disparate

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:15,069
situations it is extremely compelling so

00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,380
we use rich datasets and advanced

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,500
modeling techniques to help understand

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,870
how people are making their financial

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,280
decisions and most importantly how we

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,010
can help them make better financial

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,840
decisions in the future so let me take

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,030
you through this sixty percent of

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,269
customers are approved for loans that

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,700
are undable by financial institutions

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,340
using QuickBooks capital so for instance

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,280
if a person says you know in order for

00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,470
me to hit that next payroll I need to

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,919
have let's say fifteen thousand dollars

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,930
they might approve apply for a loan they

00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,090
might get that loan and then they see

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,090
immediately their total drawdown cost

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:58,780
the total repayment and then also a

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,180
payment repayment plan and this gives

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,370
them the ability to make the best

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,269
financial decision they can in order to

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,269
