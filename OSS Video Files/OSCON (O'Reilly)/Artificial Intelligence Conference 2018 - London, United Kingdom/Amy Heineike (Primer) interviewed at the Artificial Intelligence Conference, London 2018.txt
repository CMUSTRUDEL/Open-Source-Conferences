hi I'm parka Nathan with a Riley media

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,859
and it's pleasure today to get to speak

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:12,469
with a good friend Amy Hunicke from

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:16,080
primer AI welcome Amy thank you so much

00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:18,330
you know we've been around data science

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,880
and big data and machine learning it's

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,680
been it's been a few years now everyone

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,990
I think you've probably met around 2012

00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:34,739
ish somewhere back there started working

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:37,200
on my first startup in about 2008 well

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,770
so much has changed and involved

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,309
I'd love to get your perspectives on how

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,160
this is all rolling out now that AI is a

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:50,640
popular media buzzword a lot of your

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,350
work is in NLP also and it strikes me

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,410
that there's a lot of discussion about

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,120
deep learning and consequences of AI and

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,129
Industry know but deep learning is

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,390
something that's also evolving I'm sorry

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,910
NLP is something that's evolving very

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,540
rapidly yeah that's right and I think if

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,740
you look at like image analysis after

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,680
image net came out there is some

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,409
enormous breakthroughs and the state of

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,670
the art there is it's very advanced but

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,229
NLP is kind of like that for a while and

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,570
I think what we're starting to see is

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,320
there's a really rapid pace of

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,150
publication going on and especially

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,130
recently this I mean some much more

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,650
successful applications of transfer

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,020
learning and other concepts that seem

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,820
like they've got the opportunity to push

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,170
the field forward and pretty

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,630
significantly so I think it's a very

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,640
exciting time it's also kind of a time

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,470
when a lot of the foundational pieces

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,320
are starting to get much better so you

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,540
can pull and off-the-shelf software

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,149
library like Spacey for example and it

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,520
can do a really good job of take a

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,840
sentence figure out what that sentence

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,100
is about what's what are the parts of

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,710
speech how do they relate to each other

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,170
what are the entities so because you can

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,090
do those foundational pieces now you can

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,530
start to spend more of your time on the

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,930
creative piece where you're thinking

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,099
well how do I want to leverage that you

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,050
know what's the product that we could

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,069
build and so that makes it really fun

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,900
right you're not worried

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,519
the business case not being tied to the

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,519
pipeline but actually thinking more

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:22,659
about the business case absolutely feels

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:24,430
like we work with clients in a bunch of

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,870
industries and what we find is everybody

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,260
we sit down with we talk about what we

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:33,310
can do and then they basically say yes I

00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,099
have a huge plan we have all of this

00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,530
text and and then they sheepishly say

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:40,769
we're meant to read it but we don't we

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,560
don't even know what's in it and so

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,269
there's just tons of use cases out there

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,010
where people are overwhelmed and

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,019
normally they end up just skip skipping

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,269
stuff and skipping stuff and so there's

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:55,540
a huge need for this stuff to get

00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,859
applied but it's only just getting to

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,879
the place where you can start to think

00:02:56,859 --> 00:03:02,829
about applying it and you know playing

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,659
it you have to spend a chunk of your

00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:05,620
time learning about all of these new

00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,639
frameworks that are coming out and

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,459
reading all those people is sit around

00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,959
stay on top of this wave I've researched

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,299
this coming through so it's kind of an

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,120
exciting yeah it's a pretty exciting

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,599
time sort of a giant scientific habit

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,859
trail running around and eluding well

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,099
I'm curious too I mean from the

00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:25,569
customers perspective I think often

00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:27,280
we'll talk about data exhaust where

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,680
people will talk about that and it's

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,329
it's somewhat of a dismissive term but

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,759
it does sound like a huge opportunity

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,409
from what you're describing also yeah

00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,650
and I think I mean one thing that I

00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:40,810
really like about text is so we often

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,060
work with long-form text so this is a

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,949
report that somebody wrote so if you

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,680
think about like a whole company full of

00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,150
analysts so maybe it's an intelligence

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,709
based off you know financial analyst

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,389
they are making really important

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,229
decisions and then analysts are writing

00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:58,120
really thoughtful reports where they're

00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,680
highlighting you know what what matters

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,540
that's happening in the world and so you

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,189
know text is the way that it's getting

00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,099
communicated but underneath that are

00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:08,439
these really deep stories about what's

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,609
happening so I've spent a lot of time in

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,669
the last few years thinking about

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:13,750
narrative how do you tell stories what

00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,189
are the important points that you're

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,989
going to communicate and we actually

00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:19,030
have a few people on our team who've

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,459
come from the journalists world and one

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,620
guy was a science journalist for 15

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,260
years and another was a visualization

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,120
expert

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,730
see creative visualizations for the New

00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,810
York Times in The Guardian and so you

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,490
know we'll have conversations with them

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,410
and they'll say like you know Oh in a

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,870
newsroom the way that we care through

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,100
this process of understanding what was

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,510
going on and then communicating the

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,440
story would be this right you know

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:43,910
what's that process and so yeah it's

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,380
it's kind of fascinating to find this

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,910
place that's at this intersection of

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,990
kind of storytelling and then like

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,880
hardcore mathematics you know I've never

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,430
heard this before but what you're

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,950
describing the newsroom is sort of the

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,380
the model for like summarization and

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,180
natural language understanding yeah

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,270
absolutely

00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,950
well I'm the kind of analyst what is an

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,780
analyst to write they read all this

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:13,010
stuff and then they figure out what's

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,990
significant and then so you know one

00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,430
level of the task is just summarize

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,790
what's going on there really good

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,230
analysts so really good analysts will

00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,850
try and figure out this so what of that

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,040
yeah so what does that mean for a

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,110
business and you know that is that's

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,460
hard right I don't know that we should

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,140
even expect that we want to automate

00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,150
that our way like maybe you want to have

00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,650
people go through that process but to

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,420
get there they have to do all this like

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,490
trolling around and finding stuff

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,740
there's this huge research stage so

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,690
they're spending like hours and hours

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,300
days and days just trawling through

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,860
stuff trying to find the inputs to their

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,040
process and then they do this really

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,200
interesting thing where they try and

00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,120
understand what's important from all of

00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,140
that and that's what we want to that's

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,790
what we want to help but yeah but

00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,130
absolutely the analyst workflow we think

00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,690
about a lot like and you know they're

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,070
not only individuals either then only

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:07,160
teams so you think of intelligence right

00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,810
intelligence advanced skills is you know

00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,240
it's normally a team endeavor and

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,740
there's a bunch of processes around that

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,810
so you have people with different roles

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,240
so you'll have a junior analyst or more

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,620
specialist analyst well they'll be

00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,030
tracking particular companies or

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,680
particular pieces of the world and

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,150
they'll know everything that's happening

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,770
there and then their job will be to

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,290
figure out the most important things and

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,730
share those with their colleagues and

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,170
then they'll get together in a room and

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:31,940
decide of all of this stuff

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,710
what's the most important of that that

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,660
we need to highlight and when is there

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,310
something so important that we need to

00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,620
you know do something about it

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,850
immediately or when does this fit into a

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,500
long-term trend that we need to get

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,820
together and think about um but yeah

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,250
yeah it's just interesting so I think

00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,480
newsrooms do this in disseminate to

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,980
large groups of people all right they're

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,560
telling the world what what they think

00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,720
is important and then internally in

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,060
organizations intelligence teams and

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,100
maybe doing this for executives or

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,650
strategy teams so kind of narrow down to

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,080
what's the last important thing so we

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,660
actually think about probably the

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,450
ultimate summary and it takes about a

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,100
hundred thousand people to make this

00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:17,420
crazily is the daily presidential

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:20,390
briefing in the US because it's the you

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,760
know it's condensing everything that is

00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,040
known about what's important across the

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,420
world most expensive and provocative

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,470
summaries in the world interesting I

00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,490
mean at conferences people talk about

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,930
understanding the brain the structure

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,550
the brain and can we can we make

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,010
something artificial that mimics that

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,230
but what you're describing is more of a

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,020
kind of collaborative intelligence or

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,600
collective intelligence and that isn't

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,540
about how the neurons are wired as much

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,740
as it is about how we as people use

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:57,110
linguistics to work together and thus

00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,860
back into NLP and the linguistics domain

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:03,140
yeah and it's you know when we so when

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,820
we started primer so I had some

00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,919
conversations with Sean who's the CEO

00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,280
and he you know he'd had this idea that

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,690
we really wanted to do text generation

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,340
it wasn't clear that this was possible

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,040
and I remember a series of conversations

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,560
with my husband where he was like this

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,600
is crazy how do you put data in a table

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,100
like it's much easier in a shot right

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,950
like why do you want to generate text

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,690
and and I think it wasn't clear to me

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,180
though we'd make much progress with this

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,710
either right it's kind of mad in fact

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,530
wouldn't you know when I talk to experts

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,520
in NLP well have done over the last few

00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,200
years normally they're the most

00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,210
skeptical about what we're doing cuz I

00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,430
guess that's really really hard but

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,719
what's interesting is that when you yeah

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,180
when you think about these communities

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,250
of people you know text is what they're

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,710
having back and forth right yes it's

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,520
certainly not a dashboard of like

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,550
high-level charts

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,920
it's text because it's conclusions and

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,960
thought and when when you have that as

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,280
your goal one of the interesting things

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:04,580
is you so it's one thing to build yeah -

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,500
border or series of analysis and

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,080
visualizations of your data it's another

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,870
to say what of all of that should be the

00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,240
first sentence at the top of the

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,560
document right and so this question that

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,960
significance is actually the most

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,250
important one about summarization so the

00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,160
first thing you have to do is say well

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,390
what matters so I'm gonna take my ten

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,920
thousand documents pull them apart

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,570
figure out everything start to

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,580
everything I can about them look for

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,900
sinkholes and all kinds of ways and then

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,940
I'm gonna answer which thing if this

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,910
seems to be the most important is is

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,650
that purely a matter of text or is this

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,960
introducing notions of say knowledge

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,850
graph to try to understand where the

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,070
significance is yeah I mean I think it

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,350
depends on use case partly and on the

00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,900
the kinds of signals that may be present

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,210
in the data or maybe things that people

00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,710
look for so for news for example and

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,440
when something important happens lots of

00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,270
people write about it so actually

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,030
knowing that important sources wrote

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,380
about this thing and now often what

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,910
happens at the same time is a really

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,270
sure signal that hey this thing is a big

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,190
deal

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,740
so there's a thing called a 10k filing

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,480
that every American company has to as

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,280
part of SEC so these are really long and

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,200
most people who read them like have to

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,490
do this with like highlights of pens and

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,280
post-it notes it turns out it's like

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,660
very painful to read them what's

00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,520
interesting there is if you look here to

00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,490
year they don't change very much so the

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,480
differences between them interesting the

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,740
differences between them are really

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,530
significant because that's the company

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,090
saying like you know oh actually there

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,770
was a huge lawsuit this year that we he

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,420
really have to disclose so we're going

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,030
to make that change

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,280
oh we you know we acquired a Chinese

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,050
company and so now we're subject to

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,190
Chinese regulation or something like

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:52,550
that and so so in that case significance

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:56,600
maybe you know where the edits are and

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:59,180
where they kind of updated something you

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,010
know in some cases significance is kind

00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,690
of a classification problem it's like

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,320
you know if there's a stream of news

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,020
about a company

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,340
and one of the news articles about them

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:12,260
talks about the fact that they just got

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:14,720
a major data breach you know actually

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:17,690
even if that only got you know talked

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,730
about in one document that's probably

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,780
important so it depends but there's it

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,770
so there's a couple of ways of getting

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,580
at it so some some topics classification

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:31,490
of certain topics could be particularly

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,460
poignant if it's about a company and

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,280
there's a data bridge or something has a

00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,350
downstream significance yeah interesting

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,320
so you mentioned about summarization and

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:45,230
maybe for people who aren't doing as

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,560
much day-to-day in NLP how does that fit

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,580
in

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,340
what's yeah so summarization is it is a

00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,410
really interesting problem to so we

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,850
think a lot about multi document

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:01,070
summarization which is hard so there is

00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,900
a lot there are more and more papers

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:05,030
about this and there's been some really

00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,640
interesting progress so yeah Google had

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,700
a big paper in February which is which

00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,380
is pretty fun to read so roughly

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,900
speaking there are three kinds of

00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,580
summarization so the first one Oh

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,110
actually sorry I should say text

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,870
generation there's three types of text

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:24,560
generation that people do so the first

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,140
one is template based text generation so

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,150
the idea is you write a sentence that's

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,210
got gaps in it and then you go and

00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,220
structure data and you drop the facts

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,460
into the sentence

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,900
so this means that rather than having a

00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,300
table with those facts and you can just

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,380
represent it in a in a sentence and this

00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,470
is actually a really nice way to

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,690
summarize or to maybe more to synthesize

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,900
condense information you can structure

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:53,750
about a corpus and you can make this

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,550
pretty rich surprisingly rich so you can

00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,130
learn what those templates should look

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,470
like from the text or you can combine

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,800
together bits of phrases to make new

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:06,110
kinds of sentences and you can

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,550
prioritize which sentences based on how

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,780
interesting they seem to be after you've

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,810
generated them so you can actually

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,890
create a system which is which is very

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,670
rich

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:19,180
that's the first time the second type of

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,920
text generation is extractive

00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,180
summarization so in an extractive model

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,490
what you do is you start with all your

00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,510
corpses of text and what you're trying

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,720
to do is find phrases and sentences that

00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,330
you can pull out and put back together

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,430
again and give you a block of text so

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,240
the Frankenstein assumption Frankenstein

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,040
options yeah so what's cool is you can

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,230
use a number of different kinds of

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:51,820
signals to figure out which which

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,820
fragments are important so well you know

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,440
[Laughter]

00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,260
so you know there are some signals that

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,670
come from within the text they indicate

00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,970
which things might be important but you

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,870
can also use external signal so you know

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,710
some of the sources very interesting or

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,060
entities that are being covered a

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,740
particularly important to some reason or

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,310
something like that is it from the title

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,110
is it from the abstract right so you can

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,790
use a lot of different signals to figure

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,630
out which kind of sentences and then you

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,670
need some level of model to try and help

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,440
you make sure that you your Frankenstein

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:32,060
fits together well something the last

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,500
the last style is abstractive and

00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,640
there's been a lot of completely cool

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,770
research on this and the last few years

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,420
so the idea is you build yeah some kind

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,890
of sequence is a sequence model where

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,350
the input is a lot of text and the

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:44,090
output is a small amount of text so it's

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,250
kind of like a translation algorithm

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,450
it's just translating from a lot of text

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,140
to a small amount of text rather than

00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:53,270
one language to the other and what's

00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,700
actually some of the advances recently

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:59,420
have been that those models can fall

00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,920
back onto just extracting text I hope

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,140
interesting so if they can't figure out

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,760
new ways to combine they just pull

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,380
original content interesting so this is

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,110
what Google's paper included the

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,910
sequence is a sequence of paper so yes

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,770
they're summarization paper in February

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,500
I leveraged some of these ideas so

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,910
there's a pointer model that helps do

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,380
this kind of fall back to extractive

00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,720
summarization the abstract is not

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,370
working super well so so there's some

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,660
really interesting research around here

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,480
now what's interesting

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,569
that this sometimes fails pretty fast

00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,040
today so that's fun the other thing

00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:36,139
that's kind of challenging is it's it

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,600
can be hard to know exactly where

00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,209
everything came from and sourcing is

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,069
really important so where exactly

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,779
differently information come from so I

00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:46,610
think we're we're really excited at the

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,889
moment is actually hybrids between all

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,769
of these systems so you can kind of

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,089
figure out what the your the kind of the

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,589
best that you can get from each one of

00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:58,100
the minutes and figure out how you can

00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,899
combine them together so who makes the

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,480
determination then or how is a

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:04,990
determination made that one approach is

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,490
better than the other for a given output

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:11,839
so I think so some of this depends on

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,660
the use case and what you're trying to

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,259
achieve and I think it's something that

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,759
we can also you know train and learn

00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,579
about right so we can see which one's

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,319
working but yeah it's a really

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:26,329
interesting space and it's kind of

00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,899
amazing that we're making progress on it

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,759
at the moment

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:34,250
guessing I mean it seems like such and

00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:38,449
such a characteristically human thing to

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:40,069
write a story and seeing this kind of

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:43,009
natural language generation is seeing it

00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:45,110
actually work it's it's eerie in some

00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:47,269
ways to me well and I think you know one

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,620
of the things that makes it so hard is

00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,600
it's really hard to measure how well

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,540
you're doing so there's a couple of

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,880
standard metrics called fusion that

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,300
people use but and they're mainly

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,860
getting it are the words in the summary

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,300
words that you want to have included

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,390
which doesn't really tell you anything

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,980
about the logical flow or the you know

00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,860
how the how the paragraph works who

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,750
people often then have to just fall back

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,449
on having people read it yeah and then

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:19,280
scoring what they like but the fact that

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:21,199
that measure is hard to nail down is it

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,789
I think indicates how hard this program

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,829
is great for that because it's such a

00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,079
human thing to do and I can imagine some

00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,030
of the failure cases are hilarious if

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:33,860
you write set of words and just sort of

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:36,110
scramble them does does that lead to say

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,630
human and bloop kinds of scenarios then

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,550
where you've got people engaged in value

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,970
results one way we've thought about this

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:48,780
is one of our goals has been to create

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,870
software that can draft a report as well

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,200
as a junior analyst can interesting so

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,880
if we can draft that report for you then

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,570
it's more of an input into this

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,100
community process so yeah I don't know

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,080
this is kind of a rich way of thinking

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,700
about this right because it might be

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,890
that the next step is for somebody to

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,720
actually completely riff off of it you

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,010
know it's like an interesting input and

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,070
then they're going to create that kind

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,420
of refined final report or maybe it's

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,940
enough for them to have kind of this

00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,550
rough draft like they got that instantly

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,150
and they can kind of move on but there's

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,860
definitely some interesting boobs

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,030
through the business of you know how

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,280
does this information then cut

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,500
appropriate through the team and where

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,530
where does the human editing come and

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,790
where does the automated editing come

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,800
and then actually what happens over time

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,810
so like you know if you made a report

00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,440
today it's out of date tomorrow

00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:45,810
so maybe the system can notice that

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,680
Ava's new content and put that alongside

00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:51,750
your humor an edited version yeah so I

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,640
think there's just a lot of richness

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,890
here in terms of user experience as well

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,560
as the algorithm piece I can imagine the

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:02,430
design becomes very much of a priority

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,590
because exactly that you have to have

00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:08,700
people working comfortably with what the

00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:12,480
machines produce I'm curious two out of

00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:17,070
the three different areas of extraction

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:20,460
or any of them surging ahead of the pack

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,320
or they all kind of neck-and-neck this

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,850
read text generation approaches yeah I

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,530
think I mean I think there's probably

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,210
the most academic interest on the

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,780
abstract of summarization so I was

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,670
seeing a lot of that at the moment I

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:39,570
think templated stuff is probably used

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,950
more extensively in industry but it's

00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,950
maybe not published about so much

00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,990
interesting and the ability to learn and

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,410
generate templates also sounds like a

00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,390
very sophisticated process I can imagine

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,510
that has a long way to go and nobody's

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,440
everybody's terrified of well I think

00:19:53,510 --> 00:20:00,090
think about what would be possible there

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,280
in terms of style right yeah I think

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:08,100
there's a lot there's just a hugely rich

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:11,450
ground here for exploring yeah fantastic

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,950
let's see another question I had was

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,260
really curious about your perspectives

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,809
on how this has been changing over time

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,420
and if there's any sort of truisms that

00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:30,480
you lenses that you can look through

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:33,419
what's changing to give you guidance one

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,470
thing that's been very interesting in

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:39,690
all the work we do is just seeing the

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:42,630
the breadth of skills and the number of

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:46,890
kind of domains you hit on when you're

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:48,210
building these products and so actually

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,710
one thing that was kind of fun for

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,419
primer is when we started out we had a

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,340
very small team for quite a long time so

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:59,010
we built everything you know I I sped up

00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,600
office of a but you know deployed

00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:02,580
elasticsearch on it and and then tried

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,200
to ingest all the dates so you know you

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,929
end up doing all these different things

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,910
so a bit of its algorithm design a bit

00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:12,690
of its product design a bit of its

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,640
deployment a bunch of its data munging

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,130
and thinking about data so you have all

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,140
these different things and actually one

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,750
of them yeah one of the huge pleasures

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,360
of being in a and privileges I think of

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,620
being in the startup is when you've when

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,330
you've had a small team you've had to

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,160
build everything and then you start

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,429
growing and you hire in people who are

00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:35,280
experts and then you you know you look

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:38,490
at and you look with awe as they make

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,410
Jenkins you know he run continuous

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:43,919
integration in a beautiful beautiful way

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,929
you think oh you know this is incredible

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,190
so you know seeing people with expertise

00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,380
in these different fields come in is

00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,530
interesting but you you have to somehow

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,470
bring all of this together and I think

00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,120
that's you know that's been true for a

00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,380
long time in that you know building a

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,290
data product took all these different

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,140
skill sets but as different parts of it

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,010
get more and more specialized you know

00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,680
that's a huge amount

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,090
to learn and I think when we're hiring

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,240
we often think about this you know

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,460
people have you know they're specialists

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,780
in some part of the problem to me right

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,050
they know a lot about machine learning

00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:22,140
algorithms or they know how to deploy

00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,550
stuff or you know whatever it is so they

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:28,020
never come in knowing everything they

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:30,600
need to know to do the job and so I

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,250
think yeah that that's been fascinating

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,950
that you need kind of a real mix of

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,330
skills to kind of come together to be

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,360
able to pull it off and even within the

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,770
algorithm space we find you know the

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
chunk of the algorithms we're using our

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,620
machine learning deep learning models

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,870
but actually quite a few of them

00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,830
optimization algorithms right there we

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,960
end up doing a lot of pairwise

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,390
comparisons and so you're making a lot

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,490
of choices amongst good candidates but

00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,290
you have to pick which right so there

00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,520
may be ranking young so maybe many types

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,230
so we we actually have a lot of

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,550
computational scientists in the team so

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,110
we have one guy who's a computational

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,420
astronomer and it turns out he knows a

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,490
lot about just-in-time compilation and

00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,130
ways to optimize double for loops which

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,960
turns out to be really useful and then

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,910
we have people who are computational

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,550
biologists you've just like stared at

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:18,930
I'll be data and very messy data for a

00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:25,740
long time it turns out this is really

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:27,360
useful and so but you know I but but

00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,320
this is a challenge I think if you come

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,570
in and you try and build one of these

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,120
systems having it all of these skill

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:36,170
sets counted for you know how do you get

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,430
there that's are you actively

00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,680
cross-training people who might come in

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,540
and say someone has expertise in a

00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,700
particular area they're doing deep

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:46,320
learning but gosh they don't really know

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,700
that Jenkins all that well and they're

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,290
going to need to are you doing a lot of

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:50,670
cross-training along those lines yeah

00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,260
that absolutely happens you know so

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,840
people come in so we look for people who

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,810
have kind of a depth and skill somewhere

00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:02,310
and then who are kind of curious about

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:04,950
other pieces of it and so yeah people

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:07,470
end up just learning a huge range of

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,320
things as they go through so yeah that's

00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,540
absolutely happening and you know you I

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,250
think I should you know so one thing

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,830
that's been interesting is if you look

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,910
back to the people who were kind of data

00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,470
scientists back in 2008

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:24,040
it's actually interesting to see how

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:27,040
many of them became kind of he who built

00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:31,060
kind of software infrastructure for data

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:35,980
science afterwards like like Jade Krebs

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:37,510
who went and felt Kefka so I think

00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,860
sometimes people come in and they were

00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:45,700
interested in one part of the problem

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:47,020
and then they realized that like kind of

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,880
a lot of different problems to get stuck

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,530
into interestingly I mean that has

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,500
implications because now we're seeing

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:56,020
data science go mainstream like we we

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,540
had strata in New York I think that was

00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,160
last month and and one of the takeaways

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,030
was it's much larger and a lot of people

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,460
had never been there before

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,560
and it was real mainstream kind of

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,090
businesses who are encountering ideas

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,700
and going why never considered that

00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,290
that's fantastic and so now what's going

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,630
to happen with a lot of new data

00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,580
scientists also seeing wow there's

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,310
opportunity I should go I should go work

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:22,060
on this for five years sorry I'm

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:24,670
doubling I think there's a lot for us to

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,680
figure out still but what's possible and

00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,500
how you do it well and what it means

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:32,410
what strikes me is that I hear the term

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,900
AI talked about a lot and I also hear

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:37,090
various speakers attempting to define it

00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:40,300
but when I look at what your team has

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:44,020
done this is truly an AI system and it

00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:46,390
is a very complex system so a kudos to

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,130
you but also I think that your

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,630
perspectives on this to reflect them

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,790
what does it mean to build an AI system

00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:57,130
as opposed to oh I've just built a

00:25:51,790 --> 00:26:01,120
tensor flow model yeah and I think so

00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:02,680
our use cases up are around and normally

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,630
around people who want to learn about

00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,220
the world so we really are getting

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,180
straight into the intelligence problem

00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,070
right in a very direct way how do you

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,260
help somebody understand what the heck

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,990
is going on out there and you know most

00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,120
of the toolkit people have is kind of

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:23,110
search and document retrieval like they

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,940
know you know they can go find the fact

00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,990
but if they don't want to find one fact

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,940
they just want to get a lay of the land

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,640
there's not so many tools out there for

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,360
that so

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:35,630
and yes absolutely we're thinking about

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:40,270
it and actually I think that's been you

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,270
know so we're a 65% startup now a primer

00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:47,720
but it's but it's been four so one thing

00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:49,430
that's cool is like we very engineering

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,250
heavy and even within the engineering

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:55,490
team we've very you know a lot of people

00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:58,700
have these deep algorithms or machine

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,860
learning kind of backgrounds and so you

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,240
know we just get to think about these

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,280
problems all day long like that is the

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,780
product the whole product is around you

00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:10,070
know how do you make people smarter yeah

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,810
excellent and and definitely

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,650
intelligence is a team sport

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:17,120
that's one of my takeaways today yeah

00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:19,150
thank you thank you very much okay thank

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,150
you

00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,010
