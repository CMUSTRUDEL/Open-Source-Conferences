hi I'm Paco Nathan from O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,309
and today it's a great pleasure to get

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,099
to speak with Gary brown director of AI

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,469
marketing at Intel nice to meet you

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:14,849
great thanks for having me here oh can

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,770
you tell me a bit about your background

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,869
and and sort of the the paths coming

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,800
into Intel oh that's an interesting

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,439
question

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,779
I had an exciting career as a design

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,750
engineer in the past graduated from a

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,689
university and went to Japan to work as

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,520
a semiconductor design engineer was a

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,649
lot of fun but I realized I needed some

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,530
more advanced technology training came

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,960
back to get a masters degree and I found

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,090
myself wanting to go work for some small

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,739
companies one of them was Dolby

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,570
Laboratories the audio company where I

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,610
fell in love with audio digital signal

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,260
processing and in digital signal

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,059
processing there's a lot of mathematics

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,469
my degree in school was in engineering

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,750
mathematics so I found in audio and then

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,399
later in multimedia and video there was

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,020
a lot of interesting kinds of things

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,059
people were doing at customers were

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,189
doing I'm a very social person so I

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,840
started working with customers and then

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,270
I got this bug to work in marketing and

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,340
the rest is history

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,530
and and these kinds of applications the

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,140
audio in the video into those kinds of

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,970
use cases it leads directly into AI yeah

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,880
that does because especially in video

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,280
and visual technologies there's always a

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,570
need for some level of intelligence so

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,570
there are tons of technologies with

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,840
cameras but all of these use cases

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,240
whether it's video cameras for consumer

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,159
use or industrial use or retail use

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,350
they're always getting smarter and so

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,259
the movement of cameras to go from just

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,200
image capturing or video encoding to

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,270
having some intelligence sending data to

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,979
an analytic server in the data center to

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,040
be able to have better security in an

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,049
airport or better you know security in a

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,200
retail store or medical imaging and

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,659
medical analysis that all lends itself

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,979
to AI technology and now what we're

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,960
finding is there's this new era of

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,360
moving that AI technology to the edge

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,219
close to the camera sensors so having

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,340
cameras that within themselves can do

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,770
processing media analytics tracking of

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,600
people or being able to do things for

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,020
for these kinds of industries

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,390
or for medical imaging in a handheld

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,680
device but also in small appliances and

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,020
making these kinds of technologies

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,570
available for small appliances small

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,100
devices that require comes with a lot of

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,870
huge challenges but there's also a lot

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,200
of opportunity just because of the sheer

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,820
amount of AI research going on now so in

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,890
contrast to what we usually think of as

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,620
like ginormous data centers and you know

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,810
massively compact addressing what

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,100
business needs out in the field with

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,690
these kind of you because there was some

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,640
announcements recently from Intel yes

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,800
that's right just the other day here at

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,230
the O'Reilly conference we announced a

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,270
set of vision accelerators so what Intel

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,810
is doing at the IOT group that where I

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,460
work we're putting out software that can

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,980
kind of help developers create AI

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,020
algorithms and port them to our CPUs

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,870
which are very commonly used in data

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,610
centers NPCs development platforms and

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,590
then move those AI algorithms easily

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,750
into these very low-power accelerators

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,690
so we're taking these vision processors

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,090
and FPGAs and other kinds of low-power

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,890
cost-efficient processors and are able

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,380
to accelerate the same algorithms that

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,670
people are developing for CPUs so what

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,320
that means in these kinds of

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,200
applications let's just take a smart

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,880
factory for example many smart factories

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,580
I think in the next few years are going

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,380
to be upgraded to visual more visually

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,150
intelligent factories that are able to

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,550
in one out are there many applications

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,900
even within a factory where a factory

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,220
worker are they wearing a helmet are

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,290
they wearing their safety equipment or

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,120
not and just to have latent cameras

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,010
being able to detect when a factory

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,970
person should be worn to wear their

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,200
helmet cuz they're not wearing their

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,240
helmet or they don't understand

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,580
detecting helmets and detecting people

00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,590
you you could easily do that but to be

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,970
able to do it on-site and not have to

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,530
stream to the network means you're

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,470
saving power you're saving performance

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,570
you're creating small on-premise

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,700
appliances that can quickly give you the

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,140
the answer and with privacy you don't

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,820
have to send data into the network and

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:11,940
back and so these kinds of applications

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,910
in transportation smart cities being

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,280
able to keep Airport safe cameras are

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,500
going to have to maintain their video

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,560
and do very fast low latency analytics

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,000
on-site and then through the cloud you

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,640
can take the metadata

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,330
and then be able to do intelligent kinds

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,190
of decision-making based on the metadata

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,110
rather than based on the video streaming

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,210
itself so at a higher level more

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,640
aggregated that's right that's right so

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,920
the hardware behind all of this comes

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,120
from Intel and what we announced was the

00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,040
ability to be able to put these

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,020
accelerators out in a way that scales

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,880
really easily because of a big partner

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,560
ecosystem that we're building people

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,120
that can take our chips and build boards

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,600
people that can take the boards and

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,160
build the boxes and then companies like

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Microsoft and Amazon who announced their

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,630
cloud services running on these kinds of

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,520
platforms as well as Honeywell doing

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,180
security and other kinds of technology

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,430
company companies doing retail making

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,740
the experience for consumers much better

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,350
based on visual intelligence in the

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,880
retail store for example you go to find

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,290
a product on the shelf and you pick it

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,240
up and the price is too high and you put

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,010
it back but using the cameras in the

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,419
store they can tell when how many times

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,620
people have actually picked the product

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,930
off the shelf you just put it back

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,460
things like that very very that's right

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,229
that's right and even in medical

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,720
applications where you're trying to

00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:34,530
identify either cancerous tumor on us

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,240
getting a skin sample using the cameras

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,820
to be able to quickly give you a sense

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,950
of is it probably something you should

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,400
be warned about or not we have examples

00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,010
of customers that are detecting disease

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,690
in ice cans that just really quickly and

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,520
being able to put a lot of images

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,890
through to be able to have very accurate

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,510
detection of disease so all this has to

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,310
be done in very low-power to be able to

00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,200
deploy it to many hospitals and in many

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,720
doctors offices it's really exciting the

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,360
the scale is it's almost overwhelming to

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,760
to look at the the addressable scale out

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,290
there can you give me some idea of like

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,850
sort of order of magnitude how does that

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,729
compare with say what's going on the

00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,650
data centers I would say that in the

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:18,060
next five years the data that we've seen

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:21,000
shows that the the the value of the what

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,520
we call AI inference or deploying the

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,110
technology and the AI algorithm training

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,020
and inference that's in the data center

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,720
the growth is going to be about 25 to 35

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,610
percent annual growth in the number of

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,289
billions of dollars and the growth is

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,930
bigger at the edge compared to in the

00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,610
data center and

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,940
everyone's talking about it but that

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,830
from what we've seen more of the growth

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,300
is in the edge in a lot of different

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,979
applications that just require the

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,930
miniaturization and low power and low

00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,610
cost and and as you're saying that

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,289
growth is within business I mean that

00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,850
those are direct business applications

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,320
that's right how businesses can save

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,130
money businesses can save time

00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:00,530
businesses get become more efficient and

00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:03,169
provide more accurate and more you know

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,970
valuable services to customers through

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,370
this kind of intelligence at the edge

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,630
because you know who wants to wait for

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,669
the data center when you need to know

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,139
where the customers are coming in let's

00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,599
say to a store and being able to track

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,009
customers and decide how to how much

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,780
food you need to be able to make in the

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:20,090
kitchen these are real problems that can

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,710
save big food chains a lot of money

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,419
every year and as we were saying it

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,160
actually it enhances privacy because now

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,780
we don't side of the data leaking back

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,490
out to other places to be honest right

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,440
that's right I mean imagine a digital

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,449
sign that you walk up to and it looks at

00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,400
your demographic it estimates your age

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:36,020
or gender and then has some kind of

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,490
advertisement I mean you'd like all of

00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,870
that to be kept locally you don't really

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,360
want to but you want to kind of have all

00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,370
of that disseminated at the edge and not

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,470
necessarily bringing that data back to

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,659
through the network so having privacy is

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,030
very very important your background in

00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:52,760
to me is defining a new sense of

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,409
full-stack I mean you come from a deep

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,300
bench of doing the technology building

00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:57,500
during the circuit design but then going

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,180
out into the business applications very

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:04,280
directly can you see I guess to give the

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,849
business use cases a little bit more

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,440
background

00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:09,050
it sounds like come here some of what

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,300
you've done with DSP work before fits in

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,740
these low-power applications really

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,310
directly rather than doing a lot of data

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,770
munging

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,750
they're taking data directly these kinds

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,610
of chips right yeah yeah yeah the

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,169
interesting thing about you know the

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,380
decades ago when I was getting a degree

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:26,300
in studying DSP technology you could

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,220
prototype on a computer and run

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,470
applications on a computer and it didn't

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,479
have to be as real-time and then slowly

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,159
and and more and more quickly at an

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,180
exponential rate we have the need for

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,219
real-time for my talk here at O'Reilly I

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,529
did some work pulling out computer

00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,180
manuals from the 1960s there was no

00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:46,490
mention of performance you had

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,990
functionality you've had tape drives and

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,740
this and that but the need for

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,950
performance is just

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:55,260
so much I think it's so much more

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,910
important now because I mean the whole

00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,850
idea is that we want to have autonomous

00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,770
devices an autonomous and and smart

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,110
things to enable us to lift ourselves

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,120
out from having to do very menial manual

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,500
tasks and if I could have a robot tie my

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,080
shoes in the morning I would have that

00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,970
robot but to build such a robot you

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,860
actually need intelligence running and a

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,600
low-power robot on a battery that can

00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,430
last a long time or to even have a smart

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,980
thermostat in your house controlling the

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,630
temperature you have to have a battery

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,070
that lasts more than a few minutes and

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,770
you can't recharge it every night right

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,690
so it's it's challenging to be able to

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,000
do this really sophisticated AI

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,500
technology which is now requires even

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,149
more performance than the kinds of

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,270
algorithms we were developing in school

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,380
decades ago to get the kind of accuracy

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,140
that we're able to get with those

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,880
algorithms but you know having trillions

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,950
of operations per second of performance

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,440
in a couple of watts of power you know

00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,970
it takes a lot of work and that's what

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,250
we at Intel are trying to do day to day

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,290
to be able to deliver this technology

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,209
wonderful how about making this

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,279
accessible for developers to get their

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:59,399
hands on are there are there kits or

00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:01,470
SDKs or so it's great you asked this

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,540
earlier this year we launched a kit to

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,279
be able to allow people freely to look

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,050
at how to deploy their their deep neural

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,399
network for example so for an AI deep

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,740
neural networks are kind of the rage

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,600
right now so being able to deploy it on

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,490
the CPU and do prototyping of it and

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,829
then deploy it on a low-power vision

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,730
processor so we have this toolkit called

00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,370
open vino

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,079
the open vino toolkit which basically

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,200
was for a neural network optimization

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:30,089
which optimizes models for AI it also

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,829
has an inference engine that's able to

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:34,230
target whichever platform you want to

00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:37,829
target your x86 machine or your CPU or

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,140
your GP vpu or your fpga and so

00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:41,850
depending on which kind of customer you

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,709
are what your business need is or what

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,540
your requirements are you can use the

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,550
same tool kit in order to deploy on

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,029
different kinds of platforms so this

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,959
toolkit has been great and it's been

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,610
people have been getting their hands on

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,520
it using it to achieve much greater

00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,250
speed up even just using the same CPU

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,410
before developing technology a AI

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,100
algorithms people have just used this

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,440
new toolkit to get 100

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,700
of times faster performance so it's

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,020
really interesting to see the kinds of

00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,780
things people have done with this

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,840
toolkit that we deployed earlier in the

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,270
year and yeah the sky's the limit in how

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,710
we're able to deploy the chip technology

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,660
and that allow people to be able to

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,370
shift among what technologies they need

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,020
because some companies want to use the

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,750
cloud but then they might deploy some

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,420
devices at the edge so it's depending on

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,310
what people what businesses need I think

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,380
there's really exciting technologies

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,450
that we have to offer as a developer

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,700
could I be working with say a Python or

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,710
some sort of tooling developing on my

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,990
laptop and running on the CPU there and

00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,910
then use open vino just to go directly

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,280
into that's right open vino is freely

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,390
available and you can use tensorflow or

00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,560
a bunch of other commonly used

00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:50,140
frameworks for your deep learning

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,360
algorithm and then port them to your cpu

00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,980
on your machine that you're using or and

00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:00,220
then be able to get some of these low

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,810
powered low power platforms one of the

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,610
interesting low power platforms that we

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,100
deployed last year and which is doing

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,860
really well is this deep learning

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,990
development kit called the Intel neural

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:13,030
compute stick and the neural compute

00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,200
stick is a USB stick plugs into your

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,150
laptop and then you can have an

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,310
accelerator running so we're trying to

00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,810
deploy easier and easier platforms for

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,730
people to use to be able to get their

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,950
hands on AI algorithms without having to

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,010
go get a PhD and have to go you know

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,080
spend thousands of dollars on platforms

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,850
we want cheap and inexpensive platforms

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,580
that people can use to develop AI and

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,480
then be able to deploy them on Intel

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,920
fantastic thank you very much Gary
