	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,230
so what's your biggest or most recent

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,750
epiphany of that architecture well when

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,460
I started architecture was really very

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,349
simple and in fact if you heard the word

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,340
architecture what they were talking

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,720
about was the design of the chip

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,070
software architecture as a discipline

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,170
really wasn't talked about in that

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,180
context because it was very simple you

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,890
had a mainframe and you had something

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,599
where things were persisted and there

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,550
wasn't really database at that point it

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,850
was still something else and so

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,079
architecture was very simple and I think

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:40,559
one of the things that I've noticed is

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,450
every time we get a tool whether it be a

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,660
new development tool or a new

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:51,270
architectural paradigm everything needs

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:55,530
to be that and what I worry about is

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,539
that we want there to be a silver bullet

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,940
even though as technologists we know

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,619
silver bullets don't exist we want there

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,080
to be the one true architecture and it

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,810
doesn't exist just like the one true

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,159
programming language doesn't exist we

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,140
need to accept that as there are going

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
to be situations where this architecture

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,659
is appropriate and this one it is not

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,189
and we all want that we all want to know

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,470
that we understand the problems that

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,840
that we're facing and that we know

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:31,490
specifically how to deal with it and our

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,200
systems are just becoming more complex

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:39,180
when when I started I actually read a

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,500
paper that said there were roughly 20 to

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,810
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,119
that would ever be written on the planet

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,759
because all the problems that could ever

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:53,009
be written were one of these 20

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:55,020
varieties clearly that's silly now to to

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,630
even conceive that you could put a

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,939
number on the on the different kinds of

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,009
programs different kinds of algorithms

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,570
the way you might combine them but that

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,020
was what they believed at that time and

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,390
we are living now with an architectural

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,760
complexity that as such we have to

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,020
accept that sometimes we're gonna have

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,310
to dive into something that

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,950
looks completely different than what

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,660
we're used to which to me is exciting

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,660
because I I get bored very easily

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,690
