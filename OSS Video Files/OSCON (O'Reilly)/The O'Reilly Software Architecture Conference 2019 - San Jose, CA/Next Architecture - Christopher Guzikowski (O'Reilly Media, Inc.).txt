Publication date: 2019-06-13
Playlist: The O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	The nature of software architecture is changing. O’Reilly’s research into anonymized behavior on our online learning platform bears this out. Software Architecture Conference co-chair Chris Guzikowski presents the relevant findings from our research, introduces the concepts behind Next Architecture, and invites the community to join in an ongoing dialog toward learning and improvement.

	00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:06,140
so what is next architecture without

00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,149
getting too into the weeds we believe

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:13,960
next architecture can be broken down

00:00:08,149 --> 00:00:17,720
into four distinct aspects aspect one

00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,270
decomposition organizations are reaping

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,350
tremendous benefits by breaking large

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,900
and complex activities into small

00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,180
loosely connected pieces through

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,580
decomposition these activities can be

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,860
turned into standalone services that can

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,140
be developed independently and linked

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,610
together to create a more complex

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,710
application

00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:42,980
Micra services the manifestation of

00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,050
decomposition was the number thirteen

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,370
search term on our online learning

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:53,770
platform in 2018 the second aspect is

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:56,870
cloud we need the flexibility to adjust

00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:00,100
scale and innovate our digital presence

00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:02,450
often across time zones and geographies

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,150
the cloud supports this need with

00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,360
compute instance compute instances that

00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,470
are fungible coming and going as needed

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,659
and it automatically replaceable if

00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,060
failures are detected the move toward

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,860
decomposition has helped accelerate the

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,430
trend toward the cloud by providing more

00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,290
impetus for quickly spinning up and

00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:28,670
managing services that support the need

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:31,130
for dynamic adaptable applications cloud

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,140
related terms had a significant presence

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,940
in the learning platforms search and

00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,340
usage data AWS Amazon suite of cloud

00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,760
related cloud-based tools was the number

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:47,960
for search term and it had 28% growth

00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,380
year over year in usage Google Cloud and

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:55,250
Microsoft Azure also increased cloud had

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:57,530
66 percent growth in usage and Microsoft

00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:01,850
Azure had 60 percent growth in usage

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:04,820
over 2017 in addition the generic topic

00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:08,689
cloud migration was up 40 percent in

00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:11,540
usage in 2018 the third aspect is

00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:13,279
containers containers provide a

00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,240
lightweight means to achieving the

00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:17,260
modularity

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,990
favored by decomposition and the cloud

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,840
docker the number seven search term in

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,790
2018 makes it easy to automate the

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,590
deployment and Mike of the micro

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,870
services that are created through

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:35,390
decomposition and the fourth aspect is

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,820
orchestration the huge number of Micra

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,360
services running on containers often in

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,520
the hundreds or in the thousands even

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,190
exceeds the capacity of humans to track

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,980
and manage them orchestration tools

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,940
notably kubernetes fill the gap through

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,830
rigorous specifications and automation

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:57,740
kubernetes was the number 5 search term

00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,110
in 2018 jumping 11 spots from the

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,470
previous year and kubernetes usage

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,200
growth was up a whopping 160 percent

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:10,870
year-over-year

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:16,550
so those four aspects decomposition

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:18,980
cloud containers orchestration these are

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,930
what the data is telling us are the

00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,930
