Title: Choices of Scale - Michael Feathers (R7K Research and Conveyance)
Publication date: 2019-06-14
Playlist: The O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	Most discussion about scaling is about how to do itâ€”but hardly ever about why it's difficult or whether it's really necessary in particular cases, let alone what the alternatives are. Join Michael Feathers to explore scaling your teams, organization, and architecture and learn the costs and benefits of various strategies in light of research about human cognition and systems cohesion.

	00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,449
coding heroes how do you feel about

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:05,970
coding heroes you've heard that

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:08,340
terminology before yeah it's kind of

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,620
funny quite often this notion of having

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,360
a person who is actually like gonna run

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,429
in and save the day and do various

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,990
things in a software project is seen as

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:17,430
toxic and something which is kind of you

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,230
know painful in the context of all sorts

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,029
of software development and we've done

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,439
so much that we can we've done so much

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,750
to basically make workplaces as egg

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,250
latarian as possible and have nice teams

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,320
without much in the way of lines of

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,670
authority or stuff like this but I saw a

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,590
very interesting paper about a month ago

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,090
and it's kind of a shame that they use

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,250
this term heroes because it's kind of

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,930
triggering but this is the title of the

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,180
paper it's called why software projects

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,760
need heroes lessons learned from over a

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,980
thousand projects now they're using the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,289
word hero there for a project and they

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,129
say a hero project is essentially a

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,039
project we're about 80% the contribution

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,510
comes for 20% of the participants and

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,410
they're not talking about their measured

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,610
this stuff they're not talking about

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,620
just the commits they're also talking

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,660
about the amount of involvement in

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,030
conversations through say slack and

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,260
there's different media but they've done

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,640
these measurements across like over a

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,020
thousand open-source projects and

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,710
discovered that this tends to be true

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,000
and it's even more bizarre than that it

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,860
turns out that when you look at the

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,320
quality of the contributions the

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,520
resulting quality on the software turns

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,540
out the higher-quality contributions

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,630
come from the ones that contribute the

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,159
most so this is kind of bizarre is this

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,220
picture fit your picture of the way

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,600
things work in software development I've

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,009
had people go and say ok well this is

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,030
only open-source but then I've talked to

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:30,930
people who basically go around do

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,180
measurements in different organizations

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,490
I'd say not really you'll see the same

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,680
kind of preto contribution graph across

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,939
most proprietary development and the

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,920
thing that's interesting is we can look

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,290
at this and say this is a problem to be

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,329
solved or we can go and say well if this

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,250
is the way things kind of work can we

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:48,509
kind of basically sort of work with this

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,369
and make it humane and make sure

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,360
nobody's being overworked and do

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,439
different things to make sure that

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,460
everything works out ok when I read

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,619
about this when things I started

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,020
thinking about was again Fred Brooks the

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,659
mythical man-month

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,299
he referred to some theories of Harlan

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,099
Mills way back in the early day and they

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,440
had this concept at IBM they called the

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,580
chief programmer team and what their

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,290
idea was supposed to go and basically

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,569
have like one or two people

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,040
who are just like strong devs and have

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,510
other people basically support them as

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,579
they're going and developing the system

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,780
the theory behind this was that

00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,549
essentially the best thing you can

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,010
probably have in a system is to have

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:27,239
coherence of vision such that the

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,590
software they develop looks like it

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,409
basically emerged from a single mind

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,579
right and so their mechanism for doing

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,840
this was to go and say look let's go

00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:35,939
ahead and have a couple people that do

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,349
all the coding and other people that act

00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,150
in support roles to go make sure that

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:40,290
everything goes okay with quality with

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,480
administrative and all these different

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,099
things now if when you look at this it

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,170
seems almost like Neanderthal doesn't it

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,720
seems pretty archaic and not the kind of

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,920
thing that might fly today but you know

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,329
recently I've been talking to quite a

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,489
few people across organizations and

00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:55,829
seeing places where they have like two

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,720
three-person teams and they try to do a

00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,760
lot in the context of support around

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,470
these things had an interesting

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,239
conversation last night over dinner just

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,209
as I'm you know playing around with

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,220
these ideas about this entire thing of

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,109
team history right what do we do to

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,849
basically record the architectural

00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,010
decisions that we have made over time in

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,299
a codebase and you know one of things

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,250
that's possible is maybe we just need to

00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,260
hire people that can that can basically

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,389
record decisions as they occur and not

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,849
even being writing code at all kind of

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:25,290
an interesting thing so I'm not here to

00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,150
offer solutions but just going to kind

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,430
of point out that you know essentially

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,989
it's like if we kind of take this as the

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,940
thing which tends to happen in systems

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,560
you know what does that mean for us and

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,829
we have lots of choices in the context

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,829
of that

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,360
