Publication date: 2019-06-14
Playlist: The O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	Most discussion about scaling is about how to do itâ€”but hardly ever about why it's difficult or whether it's really necessary in particular cases, let alone what the alternatives are. Join Michael Feathers to explore scaling your teams, organization, and architecture and learn the costs and benefits of various strategies in light of research about human cognition and systems cohesion.
