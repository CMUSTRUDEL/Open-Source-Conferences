Title: Architect as storyteller Nathaniel Schutta (Pivotal)
Publication date: 2019-06-13
Playlist: The O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2019 - San Jose, CA
Description: 
	Nathaniel Schutta explains why an architect’s job is to be a storyteller. Architects are essentially the Rosetta stone of an organization, providing translation services (or, as some would call it, the “elevator” between the executive suite and the development floors). The challenge lies in not only crafting a compelling message but doing so for wildly disparate audiences. (The pitch you give your developers will not go over well with the executives, for instance.) While we may not want to adopt iambic pentameter anytime soon (Though who knows? It might encourage more people to read our various artifacts), we must consciously think about the story we’re telling.

	00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:04,670
the hardest part about this job is the

00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,100
reality that we have a lot of

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:09,650
stakeholders and they don't speak the

00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,330
same language but we have to be that

00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,580
glue we have to go from a meeting with

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,440
our developers to a meeting with the VP

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,990
of the business side to a meeting with

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,430
the CIO we got to bring the same message

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,960
to all those folks we can't use the same

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,760
words we're the Rosetta Stone of the

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,720
organization help bridge those gaps some

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,360
people refer to this as the

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,149
architectural elevator that we're the

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,730
ones that that go from the proverbial

00:00:31,149 --> 00:00:35,810
engine room to the penthouse of course

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,280
part of the challenge we're all dealing

00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,780
with is the reality that there's still a

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,280
number of companies that look at IT and

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,860
say oh it's a pure cost center how can I

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,910
do it for less they don't look at us as

00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,880
a center of innovation which is

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:53,210
unfortunate because let's be clear

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,370
technology is disrupting everything it's

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:56,840
changing how people book rooms when they

00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,910
travel it's changing how people get from

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,910
point A to point B it's changing our

00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,989
cars I mean if you've got a fairly

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,689
recent car there's pretty good chance

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:07,630
there's a lot of software in that it's

00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:11,450
changing where and how we buy groceries

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,759
it's affecting your industry and so the

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:17,299
challenge for us is being able to tell

00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,579
compelling stories we have to be able to

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,740
move seamlessly between these different

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:24,049
disparate groups and bring that message

00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,939
along with us and part of the challenge

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,229
here is we need to adjust our message

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,789
depending on who we're talking to we

00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:30,740
need to know what resonates with this

00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:34,249
particular group how do I communicate

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,020
most effectively with them in some cases

00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:38,179
it's all about cost savings here's how

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,619
this is gonna save us money in some

00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:41,350
cases it's about speed to market here's

00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,159
how we're gonna get to market faster and

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,700
others it's like hey that's not gonna

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,659
make your life better as a developer and

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,420
I know what at least some of you are

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,299
thinking hang on I have a computer

00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:55,609
science background software background I

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,919
didn't study Shakespeare you know that

00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:59,119
whole lit things not for me and and if

00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,950
you're really snarky you're probably

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,450
gonna say something like I heard if I

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,099
put enough monkeys in a room they'll

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,409
eventually create the complete works of

00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:08,090
Shakespeare so really that doesn't sound

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,299
so important now the real irony to me is

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,079
it only takes one monkey to create

00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,079
something like this

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,630
every single one of you has seen

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,890
something like this probably multiple a

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,080
few of you have even built something

00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,490
like this and you were probably very

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,090
careful to make sure none of the lines

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:32,360
crossed and let's be fair that can serve

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,120
a purpose it can help people see the

00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,900
complete picture it can be very useful

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,660
if we're trying to impress leadership it

00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,770
can be used for shock and awe trust me I

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,620
know what I'm doing I'm really smart

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:48,050
look at this diagram it can also be very

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,670
counterproductive one of the things I've

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,350
seen time and time again you flash this

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,090
big diagram up and people just glaze

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,830
over their eyes or they grab their phone

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,990
and start checking Twitter I don't want

00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,170
to pay attention to this as a presenter

00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,820
I cry every time I hear this you

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,250
probably can't see this then why did you

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,340
show it to me but trust me it's

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,750
SuperDuper impressive just just trust me

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,880
I'm very much of the opinion we need to

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:15,410
spend an awfully lot less time creating

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:18,800
these architectural I charted with

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,480
people it could be really difficult to

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,220
explain technical concepts to

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,769
non-technical people this doesn't come

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,480
naturally I was trying to explain to

00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:28,970
somebody what it meant that the cloud

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,290
was elastic and so I tried a couple

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,150
approaches and that didn't resonate I

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,489
finally settled on this I said imagine a

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,630
dynamically resizing party sub no matter

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,489
how many people show up to your party

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:42,140
it's always the right size he said oh I

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:43,550
get that now of course the reality is

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,010
sometimes these aren't our stories

00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,570
sometimes we are the keeper of tales we

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,239
are the institutional memory of an

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,640
organization I guess we're the brand of

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,790
the company which means we're gonna win

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,050
the game of Thrones how many times have

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,040
you asked that question hey why do we do

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:02,180
it that way well we had a good reason

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,989
it's important to us

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,470
to keep those stories alive it's not an

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:12,080
easy job the last thing we need is yet

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,660
another dry architectural document that

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,049
no one reads all we need is compelling

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,049
