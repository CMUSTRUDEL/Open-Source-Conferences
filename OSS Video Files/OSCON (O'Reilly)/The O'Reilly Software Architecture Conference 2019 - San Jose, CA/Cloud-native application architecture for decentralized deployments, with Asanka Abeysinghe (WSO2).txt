	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,259
how is cloud native application

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,879
architecture or CA different from

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,799
traditional architecture styles

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,260
yeah because traditional architecture

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,650
styles were more layer than centralized

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,030
with the the things that had that I'd

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,279
have added to the cloud native

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,310
architecture it's becoming more

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,650
decentralized and going out of this

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,660
traditional layered architecture that's

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,060
the key reason that I see as a

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,000
differentiator and how do the

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,009
characteristics of CNA fit into agility

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,690
and full-stack developing yeah so

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,239
because the cloud native architecture

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,329
adding some fundamental stuff that we

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,920
see with the D full-stack developer so

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,920
full stack developer there are many

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,140
definitions but for me I think it's a

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,770
architect a developer and a DevOps

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,110
person

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,300
so this decentralization as well as

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,649
adding more responsibility for the

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,379
developer to plan develop as well as run

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,570
and manage these applications so the

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,210
main features in the cloud native

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,390
architecture nicely fit into the role of

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,360
the full stack developer as well as the

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,439
agility required more flexibility as

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,960
well as less governance I would say so

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,880
the cloud native architecture principles

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,680
are clearly supporting agility and

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,920
improving agility of the develop and

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,500
making their productivity as a developer

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,020
who can quickly plan build and release

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,299
their applications and what challenges

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,560
do you see enterprises facing when they

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:38,400
adopt CNA yeah so the main problem is we

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,630
purchased a lot of software during last

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,000
two decades and I believe the the the

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,189
raw data set as well as Rho

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
functionality of enterprises still

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,299
exists in those applications so how you

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,310
build a new architecture by consuming

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,979
those data and services is the main

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,110
challenge that the enterprises are

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,290
facing as well as there's a cultural

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,000
shift so how they can adopt these

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,489
cultural shift by utilizing the existing

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,140
workforce and move with the change is

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:13,750
the main challenge most of the

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,320
enterprises

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,290
are facing from the technology side

00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,690
process as well as people perspective

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:26,200
and how is wso to contributing to CNA

00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:29,440
yeah so we contribute in many ways but I

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,959
would say a mainly five areas that we

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
have done so the first we introduced

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,800
this cloud native programming language

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,810
called ballerina how you can write a

00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,500
micro services integration micro

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,810
services and then build enter in a cloud

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,150
native application platform is the first

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,400
way we contributed the second thing we

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,590
started this project called salary it's

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,530
a way how you deploy cloud native

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:56,440
applications into communities and other

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,080
cloud native infrastructures so that's a

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,760
second level and then we introduced

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,770
something called cell base architecture

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,080
a completely cloud native architecture

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,150
pattern that you can architect these

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,410
applications and there's a reference

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,290
methodology that explain how you can

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,870
improve the existing processes and fit

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:20,500
into the cloud native applications then

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:23,230
last but not least we are improving the

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,660
existing runtimes as example we have a

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,580
lot of integration related products like

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,860
Enterprise Service bus if your

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,989
management platform identity component

00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,989
so we are making them very lightweight

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,840
and then high-performance stateless and

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:40,060
how you can fit into a cloud native

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,010
infrastructure deployed in those

00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,410
runtimes so that way and the

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,920
enterprise's who's using these products

00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:51,100
can move into a cloud native

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,380
architecture without much changes in a

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,110
shorter time period so that's how as a

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,299
technology provider we are supporting

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,400
cloud native application architecture

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,519
and do you have any predictions on what

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,299
will happen next in the future yeah so I

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,760
believe the middleware basically we use

00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:12,700
middleware for a in two decades now

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,100
so middleware is moving away with the

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,919
cloud native architecture into two sides

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,109
a one basically it's a move into code

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,560
and then it's moving to infrastructure

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:26,790
so you can't add middleware like we used

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:29,220
to do so you need to find a language

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:31,680
support middleware so that's a ballerina

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,900
coming into the picture and then the

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,590
middle are moving to the infrastructure

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,270
basically kubernetes is kind of

00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,310
justifying it as well as we as a

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,620
technology provider we are taking to the

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,680
next level with salary that you can have

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,900
most of the middleware capabilities that

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,050
we used to use inside the infrastructure

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:55,650
with salary so those are two things that

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:58,290
I predict and where the cloud native

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,030
architecture will take the industry in

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,130
the near future thanks so much for your

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,460
insights today thanks Kathleen for your

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,460
