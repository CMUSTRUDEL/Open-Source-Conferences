Publication date: 2019-06-13

Description: 
	If it seems like humans are easy to deceive, it’s because we are. The myriad traits that make humankind so eminently exploitable are practically baked into our DNA. Too often these same traits make it into the software we build. Michael Carducci takes an entertaining look at why humans are so easy to fool and goes on to explore what we can do to overcome our weaknesses and build more secure software.

Security is everyone’s responsibility, but the burden disproportionately falls on the software developers and architects. As software engineers, you’re the last line of defense in your organization. You build the technology, and that technology is constantly scanned, probed, and tested. Building truly secure software requires going beyond mere functional requirements; it requires a complete shift in how you think about problems.
