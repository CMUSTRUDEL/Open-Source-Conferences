Title: Architect as storyteller Nathaniel Schutta (Ntschutta.com)
Publication date: 2017-10-16
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Nathaniel Schutta explains why an architect’s job is to be a storyteller. Architects are essentially the Rosetta Stone of an organization, providing translation services (or, as some would call it, the “elevator” between the executive suite and the development floors). The challenge lies in not only crafting a compelling message but doing so for wildly disparate audiences. (The pitch you give your developers will not go over well with the executives, for instance.) While we may not want to adopt iambic pentameter anytime soon (though who knows, that might encourage more people to read our various artifacts), we must consciously think about the story we are telling.

	00:00:02,689 --> 00:00:06,990
but that then leads us to this

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,050
interesting question what does it mean

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,360
to be an architect what is an architect

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,889
you know I suspect if we pulled the room

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,379
we'd get a lot of different answers and

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,000
this is a tough question different

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,520
companies have very different meanings

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,250
for architect solution architects senior

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,980
architect etc one of my colleagues

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,260
pulled a bunch of folks and said what do

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,240
you think and for 20 people he got 20

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,149
answers and I'll be honest I'm surprised

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,950
he only got 20 you know now you look at

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,800
a lot of organizations today and they'll

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,980
even say well we're agile we don't have

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,280
architects they have people making

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,560
architectural decisions I had a student

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,989
last year who told me that her

00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,470
application had four separate UI

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,200
frameworks baked into it someone was

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,640
making architectural decisions and this

00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,140
is why I think that company finally

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,770
decided they needed to get some people

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,660
with that architect title now again we

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,309
can argue about these definitions and

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,690
some might actually be right some are

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,159
probably gonna be wrong depending on

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,710
your definition of right and wrong and

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,299
I'll admit for me my first experience

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,820
with architecture was really positive

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,620
I had a great architect on one of my

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,270
first web projects although admittedly

00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,970
we referred to him as dr. evil he used

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,110
to sort of wander over to us every so

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,170
often have this big grin on his face

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,780
like hey guys guys great work in the

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,990
last iteration but we're gonna have to

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,640
throw that all away and start that part

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,500
over again sorry about that we made some

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,960
changes in the architecture and he was

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,390
infamous for basically saying everything

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,170
was a small matter of implementation

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,270
detail yeah now as a young developer I

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,770
looked at this and thought man that's

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,259
what I want to be when I grow up I want

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,360
to be that technical decision maker I

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,060
want to be the person who gets to make

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,220
all those fun interesting choices like

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,729
which language should we use on this

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,570
project

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,369
what pattern should we use over here

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:11,360
which JavaScript library will we regret

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,360
using six months from now

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,560
this is awesome where do I sign up I

00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:19,750
don't get this gig fast forward a few

00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,730
years and sure enough I get this vaunted

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,400
title and I look around and I go hey

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,430
wait it isn't just making these

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,310
interesting technical decisions is it at

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,680
least not in its entirety it's a very

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,989
important skill it's something we have

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,450
to be able to do you know the one

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:39,519
guarantee I have in an industry is it

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,440
will change it will be different the

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,239
technologies we're talking about a year

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,680
from now two years from now three years

00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,049
from now will be different than what

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,700
we're talking about this year and so we

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,130
have to be able to evaluate those

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,500
technologies don't we we have to be able

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,950
to make that decision quickly often

00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,560
without complete information that's hard

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:02,440
for us to do and that's an important

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,780
part of the job but that's not it we

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,510
have to go beyond just making that

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:10,780
decision and we have to be able to

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,730
convince others about that decision we

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,269
have to channel that inner salesperson

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,930
and always be closing with our various

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,930
audiences

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,730
