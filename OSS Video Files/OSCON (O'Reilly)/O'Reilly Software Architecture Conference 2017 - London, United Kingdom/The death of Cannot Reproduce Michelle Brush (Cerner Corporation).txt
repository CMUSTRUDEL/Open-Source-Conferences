Title: The death of Cannot Reproduce Michelle Brush (Cerner Corporation)

Description: 
	Software practitioners believe if you can’t reproduce a bug, you can’t know if you’ve fixed it. This belief has led to many long days and late nights spent trying to brute force a system into behaving just as the bug report described to no avail. Issue tracking systems have a special resolution type for just this situation—Cannot Reproduce.

What does it mean when we can’t reproduce an issue? It means there are variables outside our understanding of the system, such as inconsistent configuration in the environment, state that isn’t observable, or race conditions happening in real time. However, things are getting better. Michelle Brush highlights modern programming principles and practices that deliver reproducibility in systems, arguing that these approaches are bringing us closer and closer to the death of Cannot Reproduce.

	00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:07,700
so if you search something like the

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,120
Apache Software Foundation xopen JIRA

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,849
queues for a resolution type of cannot

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,950
reproduce you will find twelve thousand

00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:18,349
eight hundred and forty nine issues as

00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:21,560
of when I collected this data which is

00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:22,999
about a week ago this means that we're

00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,560
struggling nowadays to actually

00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:28,759
reproduce the issues that are reported

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,979
by people when an issue is closed as

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:34,850
cannot reproduce it's almost like we're

00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:36,260
waving a white flag and we're admitting

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,330
that we cannot reproduce the issue

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,090
because maybe some system state was not

00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,770
documented well maybe there was some

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,660
sort of dependency or variable outside

00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,130
of our control maybe we can't even

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,660
comprehend the hardware on which it was

00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:52,640
running we don't know what to do and you

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,770
see this in some of the comments and

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,780
some of these issues you'll see things

00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,760
like I tried to reproduce the problem

00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,480
but failed please provide some more

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,210
details

00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,269
I just tried but cannot reproduce it is

00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,380
there anyone that can reproduce it it

00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:11,149
looks like the problem might have gone

00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:13,490
away or in intermittent not sure hmm

00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:15,939
seems to be working on my side can you

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,499
give us a sample to simulate the problem

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,299
you'll want to provide more details if

00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:21,560
you expect this to get any attention now

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,289
they're getting angry they're getting

00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,880
frustrated but then even the person

00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:28,249
reporting it might suddenly be pollo

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,229
apologetic sorry for the false alarm you

00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:32,509
can close this one as well apparently

00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:36,409
this person's a habitual reporter of

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:38,539
issues that can't be reproduced it is

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,780
frustrating to be on either side of the

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:43,069
cannot reproduce conversation I remember

00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,170
once being told by my corporate IT

00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,909
department that they couldn't reproduce

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,279
an issue I was having with the VPN

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,429
software and I was on my own to figure

00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:56,709
it out they said it probably was my

00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:59,509
machine so I ended up systematically

00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:02,990
uninstalling and reinstalling every

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:04,549
package of software on my device and I

00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,700
would see if there was some sort of

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:10,250
conflict with all of those applications

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,780
it turned out to be a PDF viewer that I

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,510
had to remove from my device and

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,110
suddenly the VPN software worked

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,780
this wasn't a monotonous

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,120
and terrible terrible way to spend my

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,100
day but I was so excited when I

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,120
prevailed it was like I won I beat the

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,120
corporate IT department

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,750
