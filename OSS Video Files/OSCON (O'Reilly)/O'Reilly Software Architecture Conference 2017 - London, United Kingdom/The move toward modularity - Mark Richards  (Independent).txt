Publication date: 2017-10-16
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Business, society, and technology are changing at an ever-increasing rate, and we technologists constantly create new programming languages, frameworks, platforms, and tools to help us keep up. However, in most cases it is not enough. We must also rethink how we approach the design and architecture of software for the future.

Architectural modularity will be a cornerstone of these software applications. Mark Richards explores the history of architectural modularity, discusses current architecture patterns that support modularity, and explains why architectural modularity is so important (and necessary).
