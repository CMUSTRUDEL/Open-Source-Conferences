Title: Apache Kafka and the rise of the streaming platform Neha Narkhede (Confluent)
Publication date: 2017-10-16
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	Streaming platforms have emerged as a popular, new trend, but what exactly is a streaming platform? Part messaging system, part Hadoop made fast, part fast ETL and scalable data integration, with Apache Kafka at the core, streaming platforms offer an entirely new perspective on managing the flow of data. Neha Narkhede shares examples of Kafka in action and explains why Kafka has become the central nervous system for modern digital businesses.

	00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,300
everyone kind of knows that we're onto

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,420
something here something's happening

00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,570
all this data is pointing to the

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:17,259
emergence of a new category of software

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,330
the streaming platform this is the thing

00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:22,810
that's powering these streaming use

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:25,150
cases this is the architecture of these

00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,039
technologies having companies I think

00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,170
this is destined to be a major platform

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,080
that we will see in every company in the

00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:34,150
world in the time to come but then what

00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,199
is the role of this streaming platform

00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:40,000
what is it supposed to do the role of a

00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:42,940
streaming platform is to sit at the

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,909
center of a company to interconnect all

00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:48,549
your micro services to capture streams

00:00:45,909 --> 00:00:51,940
of events from applications to connect

00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:57,010
data systems and do that in real time

00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:59,619
and global scale this streaming platform

00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,379
is what enables your company to have a

00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:04,150
central nervous system that you can

00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,719
capture all the events happening in your

00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:11,200
business in real time but then what does

00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:13,780
it look like there are a set of core

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,509
capabilities that of streaming platform

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,429
needs to have around streams of data the

00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,649
first is the ability to publish and

00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,909
subscribe to streams of data I think

00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:25,000
we've been doing this for a long time

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,969
messaging systems have enabled this the

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,119
big difference now is the ability to

00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:34,060
store streams of data and do that

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,079
properly in a distributed replicated

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:41,380
manner the final capability is to be

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,479
able to process these streams of data be

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,950
the center of stream processing

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,130
initially what started off as a

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,850
messaging system kafka over the years

00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,950
has evolved into being a full-fledged

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,960
streaming platform there embodies a lot

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,799
of these quintessential characteristics

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,799
