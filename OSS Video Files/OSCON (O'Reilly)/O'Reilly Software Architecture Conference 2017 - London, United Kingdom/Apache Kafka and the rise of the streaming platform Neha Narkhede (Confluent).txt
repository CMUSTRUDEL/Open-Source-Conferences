Description: 
	Streaming platforms have emerged as a popular, new trend, but what exactly is a streaming platform? Part messaging system, part Hadoop made fast, part fast ETL and scalable data integration, with Apache Kafka at the core, streaming platforms offer an entirely new perspective on managing the flow of data. Neha Narkhede shares examples of Kafka in action and explains why Kafka has become the central nervous system for modern digital businesses.
