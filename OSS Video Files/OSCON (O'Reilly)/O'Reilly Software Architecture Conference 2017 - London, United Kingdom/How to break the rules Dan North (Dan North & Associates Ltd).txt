Title: How to break the rules Dan North (Dan North & Associates Ltd)
Publication date: 2017-10-17
Playlist: O'Reilly Software Architecture Conference 2017 - London, United Kingdom
Description: 
	We invest so much in technology, so why do we seem to get so little benefit in return? We introduce new processes, tools, and methods, but when you stand back and squint, the organization still looks just the same.

Is technology overhyped and oversold, as many would have us believe, or are we doing something that means we lose out on all those promised benefits? Societies work because we follow the rules, but what if those same rules are holding us back?

The problem may be because we are failing to change our habits. Dan North introduces some uncomfortable truths from Eliyahu Goldratt, author of The Goal, a cornerstone of modern management theory, that help us recognize and challenge this behavior and unlock the true value from our technology.

	00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:06,649
one of my favorite takeaways from beyond

00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:08,090
the goal so there's a series of lectures

00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,180
and they've really messed with you

00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:14,930
they're great fun um he says this he

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,950
says technology can bring benefit if and

00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,410
only if it diminishes a limitation

00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,180
that's it that's all I've got for you

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,260
okay you can go now you are now wise

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,910
right

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,710
okay okay I'll unpack it a bit

00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:31,039
technology can bring benefits if and

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,809
only if it diminishes a limitation so

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
what does that mean well what I took

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:37,760
away from that is this we have really

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,289
really bad at adopting new technology

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,739
okay we've rubbish at it

00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,479
and what's more and what's worse is this

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:46,819
we're really really bad at benefiting

00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,710
from new technology and this is why when

00:00:46,819 --> 00:00:51,170
James comes in with his platforms and

00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:54,170
Michelle comes in with her automation

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,260
and a unit testing and her observability

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,789
it doesn't land people don't apply it

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,559
then it benefit from it even if they do

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:03,799
it they do it by rote and they don't

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,079
benefit from it so why we're so early

00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,090
gold rep proposed four questions he says

00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,619
when you're adopting a new technology

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,320
there are four questions you must answer

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:15,049
and you must answer them in order and

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,030
mostly we don't and that's his entire

00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:19,070
thesis right so I'm just gonna offer you

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,719
these questions he says these four

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,630
questions the first question is this

00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,880
what is the benefit what is the power of

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,829
this new technology what does it give

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,439
you that's the easy one to answer

00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:33,409
because that's on the brochure right

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,719
that's what the salesperson is telling

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,640
you you should use our cloud platform

00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,250
you should use a new washing liquid you

00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,380
should use our stuff because right the

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,270
new power okay so what's the power of

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,789
the technology that's easy also

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,890
relatively easy is the second question

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:51,170
what limitation that does that

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,729
technology diminish okay

00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,679
so there's something that we currently

00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:57,799
can't do that we currently struggle with

00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:00,890
that this limit that this new technology

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,600
is going to make better for us and again

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,179
if we don't understand that limitation

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,660
in our context usually even if we adopt

00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,790
the new technology we don't gain from it

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,020
then it gets a bit more complicated

00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:15,310
because then we need to start looking at

00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,650
the rules we need to say what rule

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,430
did we have what rules have we set up

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:25,120
that enable us to manage this limitation

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,530
okay what rules do we need and those

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,180
rules are typically hiding in plain

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,130
sight it's really often quite difficult

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,920
to figure out what those rules are and

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,180
then finally we can say well what new

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,770
rules are we going to need then to

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,520
exploit this new technology to actually

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,520
make the most of it

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,730
