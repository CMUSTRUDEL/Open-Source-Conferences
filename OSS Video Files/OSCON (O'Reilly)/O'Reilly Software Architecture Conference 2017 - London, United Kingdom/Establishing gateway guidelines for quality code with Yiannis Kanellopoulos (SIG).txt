hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,980
software architecture in London I'm here

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,420
with Yanis from software improvement

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,400
group you wanna say you're doing fine

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,809
very well thanks rocky so we've been

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,320
you've been around for a while with us

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,890
and I'd like you to explain to me what

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,410
does the software improvement group do

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,550
yeah essentially we start from

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,500
evaluating the quality of the code that

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,150
our clients produce and then we take

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,920
this evaluation the results of this

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,960
evaluation and we go to their management

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,849
to the CIA overseer whoa

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,710
and we explain them what's going on in

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,710
their IT in the IT side of the

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,989
organization and then what they need in

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,290
order to improve the situation there how

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,210
much time they need to invest how much

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,809
money how many people do they need to

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,260
bring in in order to improve things on

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,390
the IT side so in every project there

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,760
are typically four variables that are in

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,800
play time cost quality and scope it

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,280
sounds like you guys have looked at the

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,829
quality aspect and are those other three

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,960
gonna be traded off a little bit or

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,780
because quality you don't want to trade

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,390
off on or what well you you won't have a

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,310
balance in everything else we disagree

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,229
we say we've liked our clients to get

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,670
their software right so not to get an

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,920
excellent software from a technical

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,619
point of view but at least it should be

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,369
of a high quality or at the high level

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,520
in order to be able to change it more

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,250
quick quickly or to fix a bug in a

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,630
quicker way so you don't want the

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,159
perfect software from a technical point

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,869
of view but you want suffering a good

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,020
condition so you can easily change and

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,140
adopt it in the regulations new business

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,060
requirements less downtime it's kind of

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,460
also in today's business though where

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,390
we're hearing about continuously deploy

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,119
mm-hm

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,630
so it's always on the train to be

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,180
deployed yes so where you interjecting

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,430
quality is that always in every phase of

00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,420
that how do you get quality inserted

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,610
into a continuous environment first of

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,740
all we also help our clients to do to

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,049
build this continuous deployment chain

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,470
this flow as we were talking this

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,970
morning in the in the keynotes

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,350
but the other thing that we do is that

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,420
we help our clients

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,940
some gateways some cold gateways as we

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,130
call them and and and so there are

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,950
certain points that the code that the

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,080
developers commit to their repo is going

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,530
to be checked against our guidelines and

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,480
if it meets the criteria then it will

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,000
the flow will continue if it doesn't

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,650
meet and the team is very strict and the

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,680
developer needs to take the code back

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,870
fix it and then commit it again and so

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,640
you have a tool that works with repos

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,610
and github yes is that correct exactly

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,350
we have a better code hub tool which you

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,120
can access in better code capcom

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,770
actually and you can play with it

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,660
because there is a freemium version so

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,100
if you have your own et hub repo you can

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,290
connect and play with it and it's fully

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,140
integrated so every time you push your

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,150
code then you get you get a feedback

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,590
from our tool score it's called so it's

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,840
in in ten

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,910
one out of ten is really bad and ten of

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,950
out of ten is excellent we advise our

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:11,490
clients to go somewhere around eight out

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,050
of ten so at least they have some they

00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,070
are both average let's say when it comes

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,290
to the quality and it is being buy used

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,880
by teams in the way that you suggest so

00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,190
part of the continuous deployment part

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,770
of the flow and then somebody checks the

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,350
score and if the code is not a place

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,870
cannot comply and then it's being sent

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:33,780
back to the developer to correct make it

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,490
8 out of 10 and then commit it so in

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,740
your experience with working with

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,900
companies are there some common patterns

00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,950
or some common themes of things that

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,080
they could do better to make their code

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,690
work better be more efficient whatever

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,070
it may be they're looking for yes so the

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,540
first pattern which is the lack of

00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,330
communication and it's kind of

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,220
surprising communication yes yes because

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:59,850
for instance we may have a discussion

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,500
with two guys from the team and we agree

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,580
on the standards and agree on our model

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,830
and how we're going to work together

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,380
with them but then this information is

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,960
not being passed to the rest of the team

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,250
or it's not being delegated and then you

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,390
have this discussion that you need to

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,940
communicate those things to your

00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,950
colleagues but the other thing we see is

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,920
that the lack of cooperation between the

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:22,200
developers so okay how what we do as

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,729
experts and our tooling helps because it

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,550
gives you a score but on the other hand

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,620
the team needs to collaborate to improve

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,539
and meet the standards so if they don't

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,220
collaborate they don't do peer reviews

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,870
pair programming they don't spend time

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,240
with each other then it's also difficult

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,970
to achieve the desired level of quality

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,710
so these are the two things we see from

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:42,569
a human perspective let's say then the

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,639
third is of course always the business

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:47,009
pressure the time pressure so everybody

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,409
wants everything yesterday of course and

00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,060
they want a lot of things and I think

00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:52,819
that methodologies like the agile

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,580
development or the extreme programming

00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,830
hard helping towards that direction so

00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,930
that business and IT need to work

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,940
together but if you ask me I mean these

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,810
methodologies are nice we of course we

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,340
upload them and we want our clients to

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,240
enforce them and not enforce them but to

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,789
adopt them let's say in their

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,560
organization but mainly what we say is

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,210
that business and IT they need to

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,430
collaborate then it's a matter of

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,340
philosophy you can apply any kind of

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,560
methodology and if the applause off' is

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,120
not right then the methodology is not

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,099
going to be applied in the right way so

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,139
again you can say we're doing agile and

00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:31,199
you just doing waterfall but in a

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,240
different mode yeah so these are the

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,310
these are the patterns that we seen so I

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,990
noticed you you use the word enforce and

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,880
then you backed off on that is that

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,770
because in most environments when you

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,169
try to enforce a standard or a

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:46,800
methodology you're gonna get resistance

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,599
yes I think that the the teams the

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,190
developers even the vendors or the

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,610
integrators that our clients have they

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,400
need to adopt it they need to to to kind

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,169
of agree with that and and then you can

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,330
have maximize your impact because if you

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:03,990
try to enforce something to someone then

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,789
easily backfires and our experience is

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,229
that we're getting paid by our clients

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,940
to help them improve their system and

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:10,560
have an impact in order to have an

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,229
impact you have to work with people and

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,389
the people need to feel that they they

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,699
are part of the game they're not against

00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:19,289
that they're not against the wall or

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,120
against a tool that rates their work

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,680
they need to become part of it so in in

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,630
your in your experience with building

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,729
better software and that's what you help

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,789
your customers do is build better

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,770
software isn't training like the key

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,389
ingredient for them to build better

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,029
software I mean that they're all in the

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,960
same understanding of what we're doing

00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,169
what we're trying to accomplish

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,910
push yeah we become realize we began

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,069
realizing this three or four years ago

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,419
so usually our clans we're telling us

00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,819
you know you do an excellent work

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,770
telling us what how are the systems are

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,780
doing from a technology what are the

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,400
points of attention but hey can you do

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,620
something about our people can you train

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,630
them in your methodology can you help

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,520
them to understand that the basics or

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,800
the essentials for having a code of good

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,009
quality so that's why we create this we

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,300
call quality software development

00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,509
training program also leads to a

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,310
professional certification and we teach

00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,440
developers exactly those things there

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,669
the basic the most common guidelines

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,139
that they need to follow in order to

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,210
make sure that they have a code base

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,560
which is clean which is easy to change

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:28,500
easy to fix and it go it will

00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,479
compliments nicely our our services and

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,759
also the way our clients perceive us

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,460
because from what we see now when we

00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,009
work closer with them and we train them

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,599
to our methodology then also you get

00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:44,580
it's easier to get their buy-in because

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,620
now it's not like a model that it's it's

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,229
you don't understand it or it's like a

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,570
blackboard for you we just open it we

00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:53,370
explain you how this works and what are

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,250
the elements of the model and then how

00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:59,330
you can work using the model in your

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,740
favor and that that helps us also to

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,770
remove the barriers or the impediments

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,199
from improving the code and so that's

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,080
key for organizations to have everyone

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,110
on the same page using the same terms

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,210
understanding whether gawky yes that's a

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,530
nice thing because what we see team

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,210
leads they like this kind of training

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,009
for the junior developers because it's

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,380
and it's nice for that onboarding

00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,940
process so this is how we all work this

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,979
is the pro this is the standard this is

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,360
a certification and then everyone is

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,550
kind of the same page and they start

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,889
using the same terminology and also the

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,310
kind of easier line with our consultants

00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:40,070
because then we all speak the same

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:42,690
language so when a CIO comes to you guys

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,209
what is their typical request we have

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,360
bad software or we don't understand how

00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:50,430
to do agile or we're trying to adapt to

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,160
the market changes what what is the

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,209
comment

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,940
theme you feel from the c-level people

00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,129
Regis executives well in the previous

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,180
years I would say it was like we have

00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:07,089
bad software can you help us nowadays

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,790
it's like we have bad software and we

00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:14,470
want your help and tell us what we need

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:16,779
to do but they that but the challenge

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,480
now is not to tell them how bad the

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:21,069
software is because yeah some years ago

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,470
it was for them every user to know how

00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:25,060
bad it is but not how to fix it but now

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,500
the most important thing is how can we

00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,660
fix it and how can you work together

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,850
with our team in order to fix it because

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,110
we know it's bad we don't mean the

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,540
consultant to tell us that the system is

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,430
bad and we can tell you a thousand of

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,560
examples why is this bad the point is

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,180
can you help us fixing it and and make

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,639
sure we don't do it again yes yes yes

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,769
like preemptively like we now understand

00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,500
what we're doing is that that's really

00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,629
the goal isn't it exactly and but in the

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,029
previous years the the it was more

00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:54,689
important to get the insight on how bad

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:57,310
it is but now it's the question changes

00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:59,170
in the sense of how we can improve in

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,639
the long run and we don't repeat the

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,880
mistakes of the past

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,949
so speaking of changes and not repeat in

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,319
the past if you and I sit down twelve

00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:10,360
months from now here in London next year

00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:13,240
right and have this conversation

00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,370
what changes for sig and what do you

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,610
hope changes in the whole landscape of

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:22,120
software development first of all we

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:24,790
hope that people will interact in a

00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,819
better way bit with each other and there

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,769
is moral communication also that the

00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:31,600
management pays more attention and they

00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:33,040
invest in the well-being of their

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,660
software developers and their happiness

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,290
as we were discussing also in this

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:43,990
conference and we SSID what would like

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:50,410
to see for ourselves is of course yeah

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:52,720
to and enhance our consulting services

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,519
with more let's say benchmark with more

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,110
data that might be useful for the

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,240
managers so to give them more

00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,439
perspective and on the other on the

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,569
other hand when it comes to the

00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:03,399
technical side of things the developers

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,900
we would like to see more developers

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:07,240
adapting our training

00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,750
more developers using our better code

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,050
help to link so more developers actually

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,540
and embracing our way of thinking in our

00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,520
methodologies and the rest will follow

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,380
excellent Yanis we look forward to that

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,310
conversation about doing better software

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,140
thank you thank you

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,140
