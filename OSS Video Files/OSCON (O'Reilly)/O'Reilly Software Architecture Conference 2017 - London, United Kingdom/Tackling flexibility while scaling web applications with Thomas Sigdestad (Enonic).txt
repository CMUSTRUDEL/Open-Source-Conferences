hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,830
software architecture in London I'm here

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,520
with Thomas from e Nanak Thomas Thomas

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,719
how're you doing

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,750
right so you Nanak yeah what do you guys

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,150
do we we build the platform technology

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,180
so we make it easier for people to build

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,240
web sites and web applications basically

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,279
and preferably for customer-facing

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,859
scalable solutions so a platform is that

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,519
different than a framework or some other

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,769
way to describe platform architecture

00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,030
yeah you could say so a platform the

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,620
difference between a platform and a

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,210
framework is that a platform is

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,380
something you build on a framework it's

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,510
something you bring into your

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:45,629
application and in our system you could

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,250
say it's a little of both essentially

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,800
when you choose to build an app on our

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,360
platform which is called the Nanak XP we

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,850
say that you're building an atomic app

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,469
and what we're trying to do is we're

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,050
trying to simplify that journey because

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:03,390
normally we would need to build an app

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,970
today you need some storage database you

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,600
typically need some search engine to to

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,210
do fancy magics give that and then even

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,049
need an app engine of some kind java.net

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,030
JavaScript static Commerce cool yeah and

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,720
some done some as you as you go up the

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,869
levels you need identity right and maybe

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,119
contact management so before you call

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,450
the single-line right you have already

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,060
have five different pieces of software

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,030
running even the CMS might have its own

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,130
stack over here so we thought that that

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,490
was kind of a messy thing why not make

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,689
it easier so our platform provides all

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,970
these services from a single dependency

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:50,899
so if you just build an another cap you

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,759
get access to store data you get

00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,759
powerful search elastic search stuff you

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,020
get ability to execute JavaScript code

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,340
on the server you get the common set of

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,909
identity concepts and actually also you

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,290
have on top of this we have built a

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:10,069
complement system that you can use if

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,950
you need some editorial stuff in there

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,780
our website so you could do all of this

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,969
with a single dependency rather than

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,719
having all this moving parts so are you

00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:23,120
similar to like the hosting sites so I

00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,939
can be hosted by you as well or can I

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,609
run my own hosting and just build with

00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:32,680
your framework or your tools yeah our

00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:35,030
slogan is your ID our platform any cloud

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,060
essentially means you you can run this

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:43,220
on a local Max or local on your PC

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,620
actually though that wouldn't be the

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,069
server but it runs on any operating

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:52,609
system and any cloud on-premise or

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:55,159
public clouds so AWS as your Google runs

00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:57,049
on any of them yeah whatever you you

00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,200
like so that's our sort of offering you

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:02,900
don't get locked into this new popular

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,060
platform as-a-service phrase so these

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,250
are in my opinion the new the new lock

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,680
is so I can run on the IBM cloud but I

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,709
don't have to use bluemix

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:16,280
but you could use it in cooperation with

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:19,190
bluemix okay yeah so so basically you

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,799
you provide freedom and we provide a

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,079
shorter way to to the goal if you're

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,139
building like scalable web app and it's

00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,849
about custom coding project so you can

00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:32,030
use any kind of fronting framework

00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:36,139
talking about framers like these you

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,810
like it what they did say yesterday you

00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:40,879
have you choose the fronton framework

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,979
that you will regret within the next six

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,349
months yeah you're free to do that and I

00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:47,319
regret and replace it and we don't push

00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:49,639
any of that on you we try to use the

00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,560
whatever standard out there so you

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,689
interact with anything that that I might

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,979
choose as a user games in your service I

00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:57,169
would try to try to be as open as

00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:59,150
possible but then have an opinion at the

00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:04,220
way of giving you this these core

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:07,220
services without being too sort of rigid

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,959
and so what do you see is like a pattern

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,549
with companies that want to use your

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,879
service what what what is their main

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,870
goal yeah typically we've had customers

00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,959
in traditional in financial in

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,760
government and logistics these various

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,510
things and they all wanted like achieve

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,390
a great

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,890
user experience and making being able to

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,940
let expose services write to their users

00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,950
so that has been our traditional

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,840
approach but with our new platform we we

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,240
are also able to let's say you have an

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,160
idea I wanna build a baby we can

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,880
actually enable it to build that with

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,380
our stack and naturally if you let's say

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,270
we're are we gonna do some transactions

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,390
there of course then you pull in

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,960
traditional SQL Server to handle those

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,170
data so we just offer a like a the core

00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:01,990
of your app to make that faster so what

00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:05,480
if I have a fairly mid-sized to large

00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,220
app built in a web app built can i

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,140
migrate to your services and then use

00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:17,060
your service is that easy to do or is

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:20,030
that scratch it's a rubber band but if

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,950
you have coded the server purchases lift

00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,650
the front end part should be easily

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:26,990
migrated unless you do it on the service

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,970
but the server part if you have done all

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,370
work with Java yes if you have done a

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,440
lot of lot of work with JavaScript yes

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,970
then you have a nice transition of

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,240
course if you build everything we don't

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,500
not then there's my G major rewrite I

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,870
guess okay yeah but if I'm in no js'

00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,460
site I'm good if you're a no if your

00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,650
server said no J's you can't just

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:52,430
migrate it because we don't support all

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,590
no J's parts but like 90% of no J's

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,080
things should be able to run directly on

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,820
our platform excellent so we we

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,110
differentiate in in terms of like

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:05,100
supporting multi-threading

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,900
than the no jest just as one process per

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,520
there's some different details there but

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,100
otherwise pretty much the same so what

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,570
is the number one requested thing that

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,420
people want when they're when they're

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:19,580
using your site is a responsive design

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:22,530
is it what do people looking for i I

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,660
think at least what we're seeing as an

00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,330
emerging thing because it's been yeah

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,770
responsive website a lot of content all

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,290
of these things people have used to seem

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,530
as functionality what we're seeing as a

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:37,950
huge thing coming is progressive web

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:40,770
apps and we basically believe that that

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,030
will sort of replace native app

00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,560
development within reasonably short time

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,180
short version of that is you get the

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,330
best from web and the best from native

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,490
and it looks looks like anything that's

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,710
native on your device and what is a

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,660
progressive web app in your in your mind

00:06:55,710 --> 00:07:00,390
yeah so essentially it's it's not

00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,120
hopefully not in my mind alone but it's

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:07,080
the definition is more or less that it

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,650
looks and feel like a native app it is

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,990
responsive works on any device it is

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,600
easy to discover like you can find it as

00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:20,670
a URL right you can link to it you can

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:24,030
install it it works offline so resilient

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:27,420
in terms of network conditions and and

00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,730
various other aspects around this that

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,590
sort of combined make up a pattern so if

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,230
you if you your app support all of this

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,790
then it's a progressive about it seems

00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,100
like maybe some of the airlines and

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:39,750
maybe hotels that have those apps and

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,410
like they could be doing that yeah

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:45,450
definitely we think that now companies

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,640
have to build one app for Android one

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,180
for iOS and they need a website and

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,830
maybe do something for Windows who knows

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:54,240
so we see that the Google is betting

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,130
really hard on this and we know

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,660
Microsoft is coming with full support

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,570
now in an upcoming Windows 10 release

00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,190
and this is Microsoft's opportunity to

00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,800
be relevant on the client side again I

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,470
know that they just ditched mobile our

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,870
windows mobile but they didn't say

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,780
anything about Windows

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm running stuff on mobile at least

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,370
I've seen that they are planning to just

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:19,880
crawl the web identify progressive web

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:23,030
apps and added to Windows Store so as a

00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,550
user the transition between an app or

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,200
website is gonna be completely

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,960
transparent so the moment you install it

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,030
you know the browser Chrome goes away

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,010
and you just feel like you're in the

00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,080
native app is won't that be a better

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,360
world for everyone when all companies do

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,100
that sort of thing

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,920
definitely it's a much more efficient

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:48,230
work but for the time being you pretty

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,860
much now can can go this road with

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,320
Android iOS is still like yes a year or

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,750
so in in the workings before you see

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,250
full support but if you build this

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,200
progressive web app you can you can

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,660
still wrap it in an iOS hybrid framework

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,260
out and go with that so it's only if you

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,360
need particular functionality let's say

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,180
at this moment if you need the Bluetooth

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,810
support on iOS and you then you have to

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,630
wrap it otherwise I think in two years

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,180
time we'll see that most of these api's

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,860
are available for all devices so

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,250
progressive is kind of the wave of the

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,570
future if you and I were to sit down

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,550
twelve months from now Thomas and and

00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,360
have this discussion next year here in

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,160
London what will change free Nanak and

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,010
what will change in the industry that

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,330
you think would be better for everyone

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,730
hopefully Apple has full support from

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,370
progressive web apps that's my number

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,050
one hope and we are positioning

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,000
ourselves as progressive web apps

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,240
platform where you can do everything

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,450
from the storing the data until content

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,520
management if you need that so I hope we

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,490
have many new progressive web apps to

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,760
demo and many of our customers have

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,110
built up excellent excellent Thomas we

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,890
have heard that conversation thank you

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,890
thank you yeah right

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,940
