	                              let me talk about today is basically                               what what Timur does and and the common                               strategic approaches that that that we                               see folks taking to trying to solve                               different problems around data variety                               so I'm Elliott I I run data science for                               tamer basically I work with our largest                               customers to actually deploy their data                               Lake strategies very commonly and and                                and what this is what I'm going to talk                                about is is sort of the common                                strategies as I see in what works and                                what what doesn't work well so just a                                little bit of quick background on on me                                and the company so so what we do and and                                what our largest folks folks do is that                                we try to solve the problem of data                                variety right so the problem of many                                many sources of data being pulled                                together right and and and and being                                being pushed into into very specific                                applications and very specific analytics                                now what most enterprises think about                                today and and what most of them think                                that their challenges is how do you                                deploy machine learning how do you use                                all of these new analytic and predictive                                analytic techniques but in fact they're                                one of the the biggest challenge is that                                the executive view that organizations                                have all of this well structured data                                all of these well formatted tables is                                completely incorrect in most cases you                                know the organizations that we deal with                                have been through countless M&A you know                                have thousands of systems and are                                dealing with the mess that's involved                                with trying to bring these different                                systems together and actually build                                analytics I was talking to someone                                yesterday that was very proud they had                                                                                                        data Lake of the NFL all of the                                enterprises data but I bet that when you                                actually go and you look into that data                                like you're probably going to see                                something looks like this right a lot of                                spaghetti that that isn't necessarily                                it's not easy to parse now the folks                                that recognize this is a problem you                                know they have a couple of different                                approaches that they try to take to                                actually solve this problem and and and                                where they see their role is as a data                                broker right how do you actually create                                these curated data sets                                and hand those off to people in the                                business that actually are trying to do                                trying to do work with it with data                                analytics so I normally see three                                different strategies that folks try to                                take to solve this problem number one                                they don't try to solve it at all                                they ignore it number two they try to                                use the sort of traditional approaches                                of someone like an informatica right to                                bring data together and in a rules-based                                way create create these curated data                                sets and then option three is that they                                say okay well you know we're gonna have                                this mess for a while it's gonna be a                                very very large mountain how do we not                                just chip away at this mountain but how                                do we actually have a solid strategy for                                for going after this use a probabilistic                                approach for managing all of this                                variety of scale so let me quickly walk                                through these three and and and give                                give a little bit of context so the                                didn't deny variety case is always the                                the most fun basically it's give folks                                the ability to get the data that's                                closest to them right I talked to a lot                                of quants at hedge funds right quants                                are usually physics PhDs that are                                incredibly smart and they'll very                                resourceful about getting data but the                                only data that they have access to is                                the data that's closest to them so they                                don't actually try to solve the variety                                problem they just try to grab whatever's                                closest so option two is to manage this                                data variety incrementally and there are                                six different ways I've seen this done                                the first is we're gonna standardize all                                of the sources across the enterprise                                right I'm a large manufacturing company                                I maybe have                                                          I'm just going to make all of those SA P                                 systems or in Oracle systems look the                                 same and then when I put it into my data                                 Lake and when I put it into my great                                 data warehouse right we're going to be                                 able to we're gonna be able to run                                 analytics on top of all of that data                                 option two is is aggregation I'm gonna                                 stick all of my data into a Hadoop                                 cluster into HDFS I'm gonna do full                                 replication of star schemas right from                                 application systems and relational                                 systems and unstructured data sources                                 I'm going to put it all into my into my                                 data Lake and I'm gonna begin to run                                 analytics and run aggregations of that                                 data across those different sources you                                 know this is by the way none of these                                 things are bad things right they're all                                 great but they all are incremental                                 approaches to trying to solve this                                 problem option three is it's an                                 interesting one master data management                                 we're gonna have a single master system                                 right and the single master system is is                                 going to then feed all of my downstream                                 systems and with my master data                                 management system I'm gonna have clean                                 and curated data that then my analyst                                 can use I'm gonna have my set of                                 customers I'm gonna my set of products                                 and we're gonna be able to to understand                                 an enterprise level that master data                                 number four is to rationalize systems                                 right number four is you know we are                                 basically going to take our all of our                                 different applications and recognize                                 that we can probably get rid of                                        those things right we just need fewer si                                 P and Oracle systems right in in our                                 enterprises in our global                                       companies and with fewer systems right                                 we're going to be able to to achieve you                                 know the data analytics that we're gonna                                 want to achieve ge is a phenomenal                                 example of an organization that's                                 actually been able to do this really                                 well they started off with                                         systems very very publicly and they had                                 a four year project to get down to                                     so over four years they got rid of                                     ERP systems a year which is thousands of                                 developers you know working working                                 working around the clock right but still                                 at the end of the day they have a                                 hundred and twenty systems                                 so you know their their rationalization                                 was incredibly value it's unlocked a lot                                 of value but it wasn't able to get them                                 to the data management that they need                                 option five is to throw bodies at the                                 problem we're just going to hire a                                 systems integrator or we're gonna hire a                                 lot of folks that are gonna you know                                 manage and munch this data and and                                 usually we're gonna get really great                                 rates to solve this problem but                                 fundamentally we're gonna do it manually                                 and then option six which i think is the                                 most common option if you walk around                                 the floor today is that we're going to                                 improve radically improve the individual                                 productivity of each of our business                                 analysts right so we're gonna give our                                 business analysts new tools right in                                 order to in order to help them be more                                 productive                                 doesn't necessarily solve how you want                                 your organization's to look it doesn't                                 necessarily solve you know the the                                 processes that you have in place but at                                 least if you're using stuff that's                                 better than Excel right you'll be able                                 to bring data together more effectively                                 now none of these things are or each of                                 these approaches are great they they                                 work phenomenally and then in a niche                                 use cases that they have but my                                 conjecture is that these things are                                 necessary but not sufficient to fully                                 solve the problem of bringing together                                 thousands of data sources of scale and                                 where we believe the world is going is                                 that today most of the systems around                                 doing ETL most of the systems run doing                                 master data management most of the                                 systems around pulling datasets together                                 are fundamentally deterministic I'm a                                 programmer I write a set of rules                                 I have lineage and those rules and and                                 and and I'm able to bring data together                                 programmatically there are a couple of                                 cases when folks are using probabilistic                                 stuff in the enterprise today but it's                                 it's very rare right in some master data                                 management systems they have modules                                 that do something like this you may have                                 developers that build homegrown                                 tools you yourselves may may use                                 correlations and use machine learning in                                 order to try stiff shader together but                                 much much you know but as we move to the                                 future and as we look at the design                                 patterns within large enterprises like                                 Google and Facebook and Airbnb and the                                 way that they bring data together is                                 that they use these probabilistic                                 approaches these machine learning driven                                 approaches in order to bring dinner                                 together effectively at scale and when                                 you go to Google and you go and you talk                                 to their each what are equivalently                                 their ETL developers right you're not                                 gonna see a lot of folks that are you                                 know in a very deterministic way right                                 building rules that that that are                                 bringing datasets together you're much                                 more likely to see data ingestion that's                                 done automatically or semi-automatically                                 so so we have a fundamental belief of of                                 the different you know components that                                 go into that and if you want to learn                                 more you know feel free feel free to go                                 to sort of the the booth and and I can                                 tell you much more about that there but                                 what I sort of want to leave you with is                                 that where I believe the industry is                                 going is that data and the data that                                 these enterprises are pulling together                                 is going to be a competitive advantage                                 not the algorithms and the machine                                 learning that's built on top it's sort                                 of painful I'm a machine learning guy I                                 love algorithms but when you go to large                                 enterprises they're much much more                                 focused on building these moats of data                                 these very valuable data sets rather                                 than the niche algorithms on top of                                 those data sets and and they see the                                 data itself as the competitive advantage                                 rather than what's being built on top of                                 it so I'm gonna leave you folks with                                 that hopefully hopefully there was some                                 interesting stuff here but up if you                                 want to learn more about tamer or if you                                 want to talk more about this I'll be                                 over at our booth over on the tamer side                                 and I think I'll                                                       any questions afterwards thanks so much
