	                              good afternoon everyone my name is                               Cameron sim I'm the CEO of Cru spark Cru                               spark is a an application of data                               science and project management                               application where we are attempting to                               essentially lower the barrier of entry                               for data science for all organizations                               we do that through a cross pollinated                               architecture of a project management                                providing notebook technology as well as                                data sets libraries project governance                                all right in a collaborative setting our                                clients include obviously clients in                                retail health and farmer space as well                                as media and clinical research and                                obviously rapidly expanding in that                                space we're based in New York City so at                                Chris Park we're trying to answer a                                couple of really really important                                questions how can we help organizations                                ensure transparency within data science                                projects how does transparency actually                                happen so within the realm of data                                science with all the slew of                                technologies and the specialized deep                                technology that's happening how do how                                do organizations actually adjust and                                begin to begin to manage those projects                                complementary to that is how do they                                promote common understanding of data                                science throughout that organization as                                we hire more and more highly technical                                individuals with specialized skills how                                does the rest of the company keep up how                                do they up skill how do they how does                                the company grow within that influx of                                new technology and maybe as a Third                                Point how do we sort of cross pollinate                                those skills as well so we're                                introducing you know AI and predictive                                analytics but we're also complementing                                that with how the organization has                                traditionally run so it's a challenge                                for any CEO to be able to manage that                                and still be productive last last but                                not least it's you know how do you scale                                that operations if you're an                                organization that you're you're hiring                                into data science perhaps you've hired                                one or two data scientists or maybe                                three or four how do you how do you go                                from three or four to                                                  is that that's certainly a challenge                                whether there's no there's no known                                track record to be able to do that and                                and certainly a challenge for lots of                                organizations after you've solved those                                challenges it's ideal to get to a point                                to be able to measure well we have we                                have the correct analytics in place we                                have the correct measuring and tracking                                mechanisms in place so how do we how do                                we be can currently say who the best                                data scientist you know organization is                                there are many other questions but                                that's probably one of them so what does                                crew spark actually do I'll move to the                                demo shortly but just to just to frame                                that discussion Chris Barker essentially                                allows an organization to integrate your                                current analytics capabilities with a                                project management lifecycle so at a                                very basic level you define a task you                                execute on that task you identify the                                insights from that task and then                                obviously you can take action and then                                rinse and repeat so we keep on we keep                                on within that iterative cycle part of                                that is or complementary to that is                                formal methodology in data science so so                                one of them might be Chris p.m. cross                                industry Stanford process for data                                mining this is something that we are                                heavily promoting with inside crew spark                                so this was taken from Wikipedia and a                                very quick demonstration of what that                                really is as a in a diagram medical                                sense now I'll switch to the                                demonstration I can show you how how                                we're solving these problems within                                Kreuzberg so let's shift                                so with increase park we have a I think                                a traditional project management sense                                we have sort of projects the sense of                                notebooks                                projects notebooks and and data sets                                essentially so what we're essentially                                trying to allow is for companies to be                                able to define projects within their own                                 ecosystem similar to what you would do                                 in say using JIRA so the idea being that                                 you can define a project and again we                                 promote the the methodologies that I                                 mentioned before Chris VM as well as kdd                                 and SEMO so these are well known                                 methodologies or emerging technology                                 emerging methodologies and data science                                 and we're actually helping organizations                                 build data science projects around that                                 methodology once you're able to create a                                 project it looks much like an agile                                 project but what makes us a little                                 different is that you can deep link                                 notebooks from within a project plan so                                 you can essentially assign a task to an                                 engineer or a data scientist you can                                 deep link to a notebook you have the                                 ability to fire up a notebook across the                                 different slew of different technologies                                 in this case python r r and we're able                                 to support different notebooks so we pre                                 can notebooks with the required                                 libraries that you need or data                                 scientist needs to be able to solve that                                 particular data science issue if you're                                 doing image processing or k-means                                 analysis or extra bucyk etc so we're                                 always supporting new technologies but                                 right out of the bat this is what we                                 support we're also providing the ability                                 to upload your own notebook so you can                                 you know really create your environment                                 to to be able to collaborate across the                                 project ecosystem so let's dive into a                                 notebook just quickly and show you what                                 else Chris Park is doing to be to                                 complete that sort of iterative life                                 cycle so we've enabled the ability to                                 define a project you can deep link a                                 notebook from within that project and                                 within Chris buck we actually support                                 the ability to execute Python and our                                 code just as you would in a notebook                                 session in Jupiter session                                 so once this executes so now just wait                                 for the leg so once this notebook                                 executes we've actually rebuilt the                                 Jupiter UI for a very specific reason so                                 we can we can actually manipulate the                                 artifacts that get created within the                                 notebook to the certain extent that then                                 they're reusable so we can link these                                 artifacts there might be graphs or                                 images or datasets etc and link them all                                 the way back to the project so over in                                 this case I maybe wanna I think this is                                 interesting I want to create an insight                                 I want to send this to my marketing                                 manager or maybe to send it to slack or                                 however an organization collaborates                                 then this is certainly a tool I can use                                 so just imagine for a second that I've                                 gone and done that and I've saved that                                 insight because it's it's definitely                                 interesting for us and and will help us                                 track back to the original ass what you                                 actually end up with is a series of what                                 might look like a little a Pinterest for                                 data science so the ability to see                                 graphs and charts without all the code                                 and without all the logic but what you                                 do have is you know what what did what                                 did we ask for how did we solve it                                 python r or whatever else technology was                                 involved and what was the outcome so                                 what is the insight so you're able to                                 then curate those insights we can we can                                 push that into a PDF and you can format                                 those results etc so that's what that's                                 what we're attempting trying to                                 implement within Chris Park so there are                                 a number of other innovations that we're                                 working on obviously crus Park is is                                 free from a SAS perspective but you can                                 also download it from an enterprise                                 license perspective you can run run it                                 entirety within your own organizations                                 and we connect to HDFS s                                                 all of the other common data science                                 solutions we're also supporting things                                 like model deployment straight from                                 notebook so in the same way that I                                 showed I demonstrated how you might get                                 a graph or a piece of a piece of data                                 set and you can you can say that back to                                 the project you don't also be able to                                 deploy a function from a notebook behind                                 a restful api and then be able to test                                 it so we'll provide analytics on that as                                 well and that that is really it so                                 that's Chris Barker's obviously always                                 evolving but those are the                                 the areas and that's how we think we're                                 trying to solve the collaborative nature                                 of data science a few more things that I                                 forgot to share is that you can                                 obviously swap between teams within data                                 science so if you're working within a                                 larger organization you can democratize                                 your how you how you build out your                                 teams or how you build out your                                 organization through if you're in a bank                                 it might be derivatives or pricing etc                                 and maybe you have an HR team that is                                 also working in data science so it                                 allows you to move projects between                                 those teams as well as operate at a at a                                 private a team and actually a global                                 level so you can you can move your                                 assets around so thank you very much and                                 thank you much for listening to me and
