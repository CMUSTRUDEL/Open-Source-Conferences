	                              so my name is Mike segala and I'm the                               CEO and co-founder of SFL scientific so                               today I'm going to talk about use case                               of using deep learning on big images and                               how technologies like this from a                               hardware and a software situation are                               really allowing us to do things that are                               revolutionising a lot of different                               traditional industries so just a bit                                about us before we start so as I                                mentioned I run SFL scientific so we're                                a data science consulting company so                                what we really focus on is building out                                very custom bespoke solutions for a lot                                of different clients doing a lot of                                different data related activities most                                of this work can kind of be thought of                                from a two-fold perspective right from                                an engineering side of you how do you                                actually set up and think about                                engineering and architectures and                                infrastructures that allow you to                                process and house large amounts of                                information and then from an algorithm                                side once you have that information how                                do you start applying some really                                interesting algorithms or math                                statistics to that to pull out some                                really interesting business value so the                                company was founded by myself in two                                others we all came out of academia a lot                                of physics PhDs and now we're pretty                                much focused located here in the                                Northeast but we have clients throughout                                the country in the world as well so so                                the use case that we're going to talk                                about today is just one of the kind of                                highlights around deep learning and this                                is for an insurance company that we                                worked with so traditional insurance                                companies they really care about                                assessing risk and then when you take                                out a mortgage or a house or something                                like that they need to know how much to                                charge you and then they need to know                                how much if there's damage how much that                                is going to be reimbursed for so this is                                this whole process of underwriting so                                when they're doing these underwriting                                services somebody literally needs to                                come out to your home they need to                                assess the square footage of your house                                if there's damage to the roof do you                                have a trampoline is there a pool that                                the baby is gonna fall into right a lot                                of these factors play into what they're                                gonna charge you from a monthly or                                yearly perspective so this is an                                extremely time-consuming and costly                                thing for the underwriters services                                themselves right a person needs to come                                out so the idea here is can you take                                images right satellite images that are                                constantly hovering around us that are                                capturing overhead aerial views of                                houses and can we actually take those                                images in near-real-time and assess all                                of these features right can we add some                                algorithmic kind of understanding on top                                of that where we can automatically                                detect houses in structures of roofs and                                properties and things of that nature so                                this is not a small undertaking right                                we're talking about nearly the entire                                coverage of the United States right so                                tens if not hundreds of millions of                                buildings and structures and other                                things so from a technical challenge                                right there's obvious business                                implications from a Naros or a live                                perspective or technically it's very                                complicated you have a huge amount of                                volume of images a huge variability                                amongst what you're looking at and you                                have to build these end-to-end robust                                pipelines that can now replace humans                                right this is this is a real case of                                automation replacing a complete industry                                so the cost right there's obviously an                                Associated cost with setting up                                algorithms like this but you have to                                think of the potential savings right                                there's a huge underlying savings to the                                business so what we came in right our                                objective is can we develop a fully                                automated pipeline to detect and                                classify all things about properties                                right what does the roof look like what                                is the condition of that roof is there a                                 tree hanging over it such that the next                                 storm will knock it down and cause                                 damage to the roof are there solar                                 panels are their pools whatever it is                                 right we need to be able to fully                                 automate this process and at the end                                 this is what we would hope to see right                                 this is your neighborhood each                                 neighborhood you can drill down and see                                 very specifics about the house what the                                 roof was and then if any change has                                 detected right if we go for a                                 month-to-month or season to season do we                                 see new damage on that roof and does                                 that actually tie back to the claim that                                 that person has made so the client had                                 started out they knew that well first                                 they needed to start collecting these                                 images and then the idea was they have                                 to have or they had                                                   full-time to actually annotate these                                 images right can we take these images                                 and somebody go in there and label                                 everything that's a Sun roof or whatever                                 it happens to be so this is a huge cost                                 to them but what they are essentially                                 we're doing I don't even think they                                 realized it but they were building a                                 very detailed training set right they                                 had                                                                      of thousands of images building us a                                 really robust training set so they had                                 tried some very true                                 shanell computer vision methodologies                                 right some out-of-the-box OpenCV and                                 such but was getting nowhere right so                                 this is when they were seeing huge high                                 false positive rates and things of that                                 nature and this is at the point where                                 they brought us in and we quickly                                 obviously discuss with them the need for                                 moving from a traditional computer                                 vision methodology to how do you                                 accelerate this using GPU technology                                 right how can we invoke the latest kind                                 of software and hardware stack to solve                                 a very difficult problem so that's                                 exactly what we did so there's pretty                                 much three main things that we need to                                 think about when we build these                                 end-to-end image processing pipelines                                 the first is how do we actually build an                                 annotation tool such that somebody could                                 sit there and label these things on the                                 fly you need to be able to encapsulate                                 the roof feature in the solar panels and                                 the pools in a way that somebody can                                 quickly go through this and actually                                 create your training set once you do                                 that right now how do you actually deal                                 with petabytes if not sent the bytes or                                 anything of that scale of images coming                                 in off the satellite stream in                                 near-real-time                                 right that's a huge engineering                                 undertaking and then finally of course                                 we get that we have the images we have                                 the pipeline now let's do the fun stuff                                 right what's the deep learning                                 architectures what is the infrastructure                                 that we're going to use to actually be                                 able to do something really                                 sophisticated so just to give you a bit                                 of a hint into this right so we we help                                 them completely build out their entire                                 hardware and software stack right we                                 were able to utilize a lot of open                                 datasets that actually existed on the                                 Internet then already labeled things                                 like solar panels and trees but we                                 obviously relied extremely heavily on                                 purchased satellite information from                                 hovering satellites and also from drones                                 then we we really kind of sat down and                                 we thought really long and hard about                                 the current neural network architectures                                 out there and how to build something                                 nearly from scratch using tensorflow and                                 NVIDIA GPUs and such to go through this                                 entire kind of process of being able to                                 do this and this ended up being quite                                 successful so we had a kind of first                                 phase timeline of about six months and                                 in this in this process we were able to                                 completely do everything that we were                                 set out to do right we were able to put                                 this full loop in there from ingestion                                 of the data from labeling to actually                                 the algorithms with a complete quality                                 control feedback so as new labels images                                 are coming in and being labeled where                                 to put that into our training set so now                                 you can get rid of your                                           working around the clock image labeling                                 right so that's a huge cost savings to                                 the business and what you have is a                                 completely scalable solution for this                                 insurance underwriting use case right so                                 now what we've literally done right in a                                 six months time is we've taken an                                 industry that relies on humans going out                                 to somebody's home and manually labeling                                 things to being able using satellite                                 images in deep learning technology to                                 actually revolutionize what they've been                                 doing for the past I don't know                                       hundred years or so so here's just a                                 kind of fun little example I know it's                                 really hard to see since you guys are                                 far by but this is roughly an image of I                                 don't know maybe                                                         or something and what you can see the                                 algorithm starts to do right it goes in                                 there and starts building very kind of                                 strict bounding boxes around the houses                                 and then once these bounding box you                                 kind of zoom in you can see key features                                 like here's the square footage of the                                 home here are the identified trampolines                                 or pools and then if you dig down even                                 further you can start to see even                                 granular detail like here's the quality                                 of the roof here's the actual material                                 that the roof is made of so it's a                                 pretty remarkable results that you were                                 able to get out so of course this is                                 only the first thing right there's                                 there's tons of other things that we                                 want to think about right can you                                 identify the difference between                                 above-ground or in ground pool right                                 small differences like this actually are                                 really meaningful from an insurance                                 policy standpoint so by no means right                                 is this a finished solution we can think                                 about all sorts of different                                 segmentation classification regression                                 metrics around the deep learning                                 architectures themselves oh good                                 I got about another minute so so this is                                 just a really quick use case right so                                 this is how do you build an end-to-end                                 pipeline on image analysis and insurance                                 but by no means is this only applicable                                 to insurance itself right every field                                 out there today is kind of pushing                                 towards this end-to-end pipeline using                                 some kind of machine learning or deep                                 learning right from health care to                                 agriculture manufacturing security                                 transportation all these industries                                 themselves are being underlined changed                                 fundamentally with a lot of the                                 technologies that are coming out                                 literally you know in the last few                                 months and you know will be happening in                                 the last next few years so that's us I                                 made my time so again so we're SF                                 scientific if you want to chat again                                 we're a consulting company so we really                                 help all sorts of people solve varying                                 different types of challenges with their                                 company and we're back there in the                                 innovator booth near the big nvidia tent                                 thank you guys
