	                              good afternoon everyone I'm Gregory ursu                               interaction architect at Devo it's                               really exciting to be here just to get a                               sense of how quickly things are moving                               in this space but with all this awesome                               new technology and greater and greater                               insights I think the business users                               question today remains the same you know                               what does this insight mean to me what                                does it mean for my business what does                                it mean for my processes and even though                                we're embracing big data along with the                                AI connectors that are becoming                                available today we can't we have to all                                come to terms with the fact that we                                won't provide enough value to the                                business users unless they can truly                                understand and create that impact within                                their own business context really apply                                that knowledge within their own business                                space so having said that I'm sure                                you're all familiar with Stern this guy                                on here                                I'm sure you're all familiar with the                                knowledge pyramid where we have data on                                the bottom this data doesn't mean much                                to us unless it's connected and                                organized so that we can digest it but                                this data then becomes information                                information that we can further connect                                look at contextually start understanding                                what it means in our own space and in                                our own time in our own context which                                then can become knowledge and the deeper                                this knowledge becomes the more we can                                understand and be able to not only                                process this knowledge but apply this                                knowledge and a lot of the excitement                                around AI today has to do with                                classification tools understanding the                                difference for example between a lion                                and on the road and a tree for                                self-driving capability and this is just                                again creating new knowledge we're on                                the other hand we're looking to layer                                all of this knowledge on the user                                context in their own business context                                and when we do that we can truly start                                understanding that knowledge and                                applying that knowledge without getting                                too esoteric on you we can define wisdom                                as really the optimal application of                                knowledge having that understand that                                deep understanding not only to see what                                the issues are but to understand the                                underlying factors or the why behind the                                what and I work with some very brilliant                                people that thought about I have the                                great fortune of working with them and                                they were able to think about a                                framework as far as you know how do we                                go from knowledge to wisdom and how do                                we make decisions optimally this                                decision cognitive decision-making                                framework is what we call the                                opportunity driven framework where we                                actually understanding business context                                and understanding the business user we                                can kind of package this wisdom into                                decisions these decisions are not only                                quantified for the user but the system                                actually starts that conversation so                                comparing it to any type of self-service                                bi tool                                really there is no comparison because on                                on one hand the user is really starting                                that interaction whereas with d---rom                                always working in the background to                                synthesize knowledge and user                                preferences and user context it really                                unearths these opportunity types these                                opportunities and articulates them to                                the user now the question is from a UX                                perspective how do we kind of create                                this symbiotic relationship between                                machine and the human decision-making                                process obviously that human                                decision-making process really changes                                depending on again context in my case if                                I'm making a decision and my wife is                                thrown into the mix then that whole                                decision-making process is taken care of                                but from a user perspective and from a                                user experience perspective the where                                the rubber hits the road we have to                                understand that we're trying to guide                                the user through their own specific                                decision-making process and in order to                                do that the way we really thought about                                 this was again the user experience is                                 really being driven and inspired by this                                 contextual thinking so if you can                                 imagine rather than interfacing with the                                 UI you're interfacing with your                                 navigation so the navigation knows where                                 you are along your decision-making                                 journey wherever that may be                                 understands it and you can converse with                                 this dual persona in order to understand                                 exactly what you're looking at and to                                 have a conversation with the persona in                                 order to make that optimal decision                                 again this means that the navigation                                 changes depending on the component                                 beyond this beyond this kind of layering                                 of information contextually we've                                 created                                 we've created the Devo persona has its                                 own kind of conversational persona that                                 we've separated and the user can have a                                 guided conversation inside this process                                 as well to give you a sense of what this                                 would look like I'm going to show you                                 one of the first iterations of a use                                 case that is being applied to a fast                                 fashion retailer where they're looking                                 at optimizing their assortment planning                                 it's great to see how you know                                 optimizing their process by                                       leading to a                                                   difference to their bottom line and in                                 this case the user is looking at a                                 specific assortment planned and he was                                 telling him them the difference but also                                 providing all these contextual tidbits                                 all this related information where the                                 user can understand exactly what's going                                 on with this specific decision that we                                 packaged for them inside their own                                 process without being encumbered by a                                 specific process that we've prescribed                                 for them as I mentioned this kind of                                 conversational aspect is quite unique in                                 the sense that not only are you having                                 an inline kind of conversation I'm sure                                 you've seen chat BOTS or different types                                 of applications where you can you know                                 question answer beyond that the user                                 would ask a question they would receive                                 an answer whether it's textual or visual                                 depending on on the requirement they                                 also received context an expansion of                                 that answer comes in the form of context                                 and again kind of tying in seemingly                                 unrelated information we can derive                                 insights with regards to this specific                                 conversation even though they're                                 seemingly unrelated people can                                 synthesize this knowledge in order to                                 kind of guide the conversation in a                                 different direction and of course by                                 giving the user related questions again                                 we're guiding the conversation whether                                 it's in                                 opportunity framework where we have this                                 persona layered on top of the the UI or                                 specifically in the conversational                                 persona so that's essentially in a                                 nutshell how we're guiding the                                 conversation in order to get from data                                 to wisdom data in wisdom out that's                                 doable                                 come talk to me at booth
