	                              I'm going to press an Lin scale alien                               scale is a new database the teacher is                               all of many years of research on                               translational and data management                               currently we are working with several                               big companies in different verticals                               like banking telcos tell tech concern so                               I will go through this series of pains                               that we solve how we solve them the                                first one is the lack of scalable                                operational databases as you know                                operational databases they don't didn't                                scale and they are the main IT                                bottleneck for the efficient what what                                we have developed is the scalable                                translational manager that is has solved                                the D key bottleneck on operational                                databases that is how to scale out the                                other properties our database is able to                                scale from one to even thousands of                                nodes it is cast out linearly and it                                provides full SQL and full philosophy                                properties in this way you interpret                                circuit that don't have to waste any                                more time in twisting the business                                application in order to not to break the                                operational database they know that Lin                                scale will handle any load that they                                might run on it and then they can devote                                all their time just exclusively to to                                solve their business application logic                                the scalability of the database is such                                that I can even substitute a mainframe                                is the only technology that can do that                                today so the second pain that we solve                                as you know today enterprises they have                                two different kinds of databases they                                have the operational databases and they                                have the data warehouses because of this                                separation between the two data                                resistance                                they have to copy the data from one into                                the other in a process known as ETL as                                fat for low and as you know this is a                                continuous headache companies and                                weights of money and a fork                                it requires at                                                   maintaining the DTL also it has to be                                developed it has to be planned as                                unscheduled so it doesn't disturb the                                operational database and additionally                                the analytics that you get out of the                                this architecture they are over stale                                data because typically the data that has                                been copied the day before or the week                                before so you are getting stale                                analytics so the way we have solved this                                is by we have a combined like                                  different innovations that has allowed                                us to combine in a single database                                system they took up abilities they two                                features so we are providing a database                                that is an operational with the scalable                                database but that on the other hand it                                has data warehouse capabilities                                basically what we have is a data                                warehouse engine that is working diddly                                over the operational data and therefore                                you get a real-time analytical queries                                you get analytical queries that are                                working on the real-time data with this                                you don't need to have ideals anymore on                                on the on the other hand now you are                                getting analytics over the fresh                                real-time data so if you have perishable                                insights they will not aspire you will                                be able to shine it then immediately as                                they are discover another key feature                                that Lin scale has is that is fully                                elastic let me detail what I mean by                                this                                so our study changing is a disability                                slowly changing that is able to migrate                                fragments of data from one server into                                another server without stopping anything                                not even the rat in the quality of                                service of that an assertion assessing                                this piece of data that is being moved                                with this we able to provide two                                two key features one is to be able to                                dynamically balance the load in a                                continuous manner so in this way you are                                warranted at the you have a cluster and                                the full class I fully utilize take into                                account that regular solutions that what                                will happen is that you have a cluster                                of ten machines                                some of them will be overloaded some of                                the other machines will be under loaded                                 and then you will not be able to fully                                 utilize the whole cluster in in the case                                 of Lin scale because of this capability                                 of being able to migrate data in a non                                 intership matter we can perform dynamic                                 load balancing in a continuous manner                                 wasn't in that the whole cluster is                                 fully utilized additionally we can                                 deploy new servers dynamically the log                                 will be distributed alone all of them or                                 we can the Commission servers that are                                 not needed anymore and again this can be                                 done in a totally non-intrusive manner                                 another important characteristic that we                                 have is that our architecture is based                                 on a proprietary story training that is                                 a disability to scale out storage engine                                 in fantasy relational key-value                                 datastore that we have developed and                                 then on top of this we have a                                 distributed query engine that is able to                                 to DCB both the LTP and a lob workload                                 now because of this peculiar                                 architecture that we have now it turns                                 out that you you can office your data                                 through SQL and I will our JDBC driver                                 but because the storage layer is a key                                 value a relational key value data sir                                 you can access the same data without                                 using SQL dinner list with a key value                                 interface that provides you not only                                 puts on gate but scans and scan with                                 predicates                                 this means that then for simple                                 operations like data ingestion you have                                 an application with the larger data                                 ingestion let's say a stock trading or                                 an IOT application the ingestion of data                                 that will be consuming more most of your                                 resources on the data management in Data                                 Manager it can go through the key/value                                 interface and therefore highly reducing                                 the cause of ingesting all this data                                 also if you have simple queries that are                                 arranged wedding with predicates they                                 can algo also go through the key/value                                 interface saving a lot of the overhead                                 of SQL processing so basically you can                                 use either of the two interfaces then                                 whatever is more convenient for you so a                                 little bit more about our story changing                                 that is called Kiwi Kiwi has several                                 innovations there one is that is ultra                                 efficient is based on a new invented                                 data future that allow us to be highly                                 efficient for insertions like a key                                 value data source but we are highly                                 efficient for range queries as SQL story                                 changes are the office that we are                                 Victoria so we are using today commodity                                 servers they have better processing like                                 the old supercomputers but now it's                                 available in AMD and Intel regular                                 servers so we are taking advantage of                                 the single stash of multiple data                                 brutally efficient and bostonia register                                 to get the honest elevation both for the                                 searches and for the SQL query                                 processing docket etcher is radically                                 new is you cannot find anything similar                                 to us in the market and it's highly                                 efficient for multi-core many core                                 architectures and new market atures we                                 are able not to consume any cpu cycle                                 for context ThreatCon the switches that                                 synchronization and remote Newmark sizes                                 also we are high veted                                 a row on : are a storage and with this                                 we can get a colonization for analytical                                 queries when you perform where tables                                 with a large number of columns so                                 finally as a summary                                 scale is another scalable operational                                 database is a foolish girl philosophy                                 database with this you get what you can                                 get with Oracle or in the irregular                                 operational database but is a share                                 nothing data is that can scale out                                 linearly as much as you need from one to                                 thousands of servers                                 it can reach even billion a day                                 transaction per second so basically you                                 don't have to worry anymore about the                                 scale do you know that the database will                                 handle it for you it has they took up                                 abilities operational on analytical so                                 you can run analytical queries over your                                 operational data then because our study                                 changing is a key value data sir the
