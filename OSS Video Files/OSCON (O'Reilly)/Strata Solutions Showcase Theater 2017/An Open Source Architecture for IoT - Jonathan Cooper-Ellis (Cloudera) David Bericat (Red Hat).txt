	                              hi my name is Jonathan Cooper Ellis I'm                               an engineer in the field organization at                               Cloudera I'm here with David barakat who                               was a senior global architect for IOT at                               Red Hat we're gonna be talking about an                               end-to-end open source architecture for                               the Internet of Things aka                               IOT so part of this end and architecture                               involves a couple players I'm going to                                take a second to introduce those                                obviously if you're here at this                                conference you're probably familiar with                                cloud era we are a modern platform for                                machine learning and analytics optimized                                for the cloud so we're really about data                                management and analytics red-hats a big                                part of this                                you know them best for the Red Hat                                Enterprise Linux operating system but                                they actually do a whole bunch of other                                things around IT infrastructure                                technology like OpenStack virtualization                                OpenShift container platform and they                                have the whole JBoss product suite                                around enterprise integration                                applications and things like that so a                                lot of cool stuff coming out of Red Hat                                and then a company maybe you're not as                                familiar with called Eurotech they're on                                the operational technology side so                                everything that you need to do to get                                devices out there at the edge or in the                                field talking to each other                                communicating back to the cloud or a                                core platform managing those devices                                controlling them                                you know hardened hardware and software                                that's that's their area of expertise if                                you're familiar with IOT have probably                                heard of the mqtt communication protocol                                they were some of the co-inventors of                                that so they're bringing a lot of                                expertise around you know IOT in the                                field to this and then underneath all of                                this bringing us all together is the                                Eclipse Foundation which you know best                                known for their IDE actually has a lot                                of open source projects going on                                particularly in the IOT ecosystem sort                                of like you know we're here talking                                about Big Data and Apache and things                                like that                                Eclipse is really everything cool going                                on in open source is coming out of                                Eclipse so Justin you know another                                couple words on Eclipse there's you know                                tons of code tons of projects tons of                                developers from around the world                                contributing to these things I mean some                                really big companies backing these                                projects as well so you're familiar with                                these logos up here you know glut area                                Tech Red Hat of course companies like                                Bosh GE Google sa P more recently Intel                                is getting involved in this as well so                                you know again a lot of momentum behind                                this definitely worth checking out                                just to introduce IOT architectures                                overall very quickly you know generally                                when we think about IOT we talk about                                the edge and the core so there's like                                the the gateway and the connected things                                over there and that's what we consider                                to be the edge and everything to the                                right of that you know the IOT                                integration of the data management                                analytics platform in the enterprise                                applications that's sort of the cloud or                                the core platform layer in between that                                is a wide area network of the internet                                and that's really what differentiates                                IOT from typical solutions is that you                                need to be able to control devices and                                get data and send control the things                                that are you know out there somewhere                                and so you know these the key areas we                                talk about are the IOT gateways which                                are really orchestrating and sort of                                quarterbacking that at the edge you know                                that's where you're in able to do                                analytics and things like that out there                                and then you've got the integration hub                                which is where sort of the the edge of                                your core platform or your cloud                                platform so you can securely manage your                                devices bring data in send control                                messages back out to them there and then                                you've got you know of course IOT is                                really all about information at the end                                 of the day and trying to derive value                                 from data and information people trying                                 to do analytics and things like that and                                 so you've got you know platform for that                                 and then your enterprise applications                                 integrate with that IOT hub component                                 and the data management analytics                                 platform so some of the projects so                                 we're gonna be talking about                                 specifically eclipse core Eclipse qapla                                 two projects out of the idea Clips IOT                                 ecosystem and clutter our CDH which                                 you've heard of and then Red Hat                                 openshift origin which is open source                                 container platform is it off now yeah so                                 the first example that we use to apply                                 this architecture was on an industry for                                 the raw demo that we put together                                 basically what we did was simulating how                                 different machines we put some sensors                                 on it and we collected different                                 elementary data coming from temperature                                 vibration and accelerometers and things                                 like that and we're moving that all that                                 telemetry data at the an IOT gateway                                 that is giving you the field                                 connectivity over different field                                 protocols like OPC UA or campus or                                 multiple things like that and they                                 transformed those streams into standards                                 like ng DT or n QP so it can be sent to                                 a centralized location but with the                                 particularities                                 you're only sending the right data in                                 the right information you can do filter                                 you can process and you can apply some                                 intelligence there obviously the big                                 thing that we're announcing with cloud                                 era and you know tech is being able to                                 apply its analytics and running machine                                 learning models at the eighth's at the                                 actual gateway at the field so you can                                 take the system's faster and better and                                 react the things before they occur                                 in a low latency way of approaching                                 these types of test scenarios and why'd                                 you move to the IOT hub you're                                 collecting all the data all the                                 information you're applying different                                 device management capabilities to be                                 able to handle and control all your                                 infrastructure that is going to be                                 deploy at the field and we're dumping                                 all the data to the centralized data                                 management platform that is provided by                                 caldera they get all the data ingest                                 that store that and are able to                                 basically with the real-time data and                                 the historical data be smarter about how                                 they create those creative machine                                 learning models and once they're built                                 they're pushing that everything to the                                 edge to be running right there so we                                 have machine learning models running at                                 the eighth's at the core or at any given                                 point in this architecture that we put                                 in so we created a demo is a hundred                                 percent functional and we're gonna have                                 the other booth so please come and check                                 it out but basically we wanted to                                 simulate a company that is having a hard                                 time in running unplanned maintenance                                 windows with a lot of data I mean and                                 that's affecting the production capacity                                 of their facilities and they wanted to                                 kind of move to a more proactive way of                                 handling the risk and being able to                                 schedule plan maintenance windows                                 they're a lot shorter and there are a                                 lot more cost efficient so we change to                                 a data-driven a a kind of architecture                                 and to a condition based monitoring way                                 of doing these things and I don't have                                 time to explain everything here but I                                 just wanted to let you know that                                 everything that we're going to show in a                                 video right now it is up and running                                 Israel is POS already and there's                                 nothing simulated                                 so please come and check that out after                                 what's the booth you wanna know some of                                 those projects better this is more less                                 that we're doing with camel caca spark                                 in things that you already know and                                 obviously we have commercial enterprise                                 suffering and support by the three                                 partnerships that we collaborating this                                 initiative are Cloudera duratec and                                 rahat all right so we're gonna show a                                 demo right now it's gonna be probably a                                 little short on time for the video but                                 let's go there six months ago the                                 company's data science and engineering                                 team worked closely with its                                 stakeholders to develop and design a                                 predictive model and IOT solution to                                 maximize an efficiency and minimize cost                                 our demo begins in the morning of a                                 typical day Bob the executive just                                 received a new order from one of its                                 strategic partners Bob reviews the                                 numbers over the last six months noting                                 that revenue was looking good in steady                                 production capacity is a healthy                                 ninety-seven five percent and their cost                                 per unit has remained consistently lower                                 planned maintenance costs have risen as                                 expected but offset by a much greater                                 reduction in unplanned maintenance and                                 line shutdown frequency his facilities                                 while continuing to age show no signs of                                 weakness and orders are progressing Bob                                 sends an email to Alexandre the                                 operations manager to start the new                                 order a few minutes later Alexandre                                 reviews the production calendar for her                                 facilities she looks over the in                                 progress operations from the job started                                 last night                                 everything looks green on line one and                                 the real-time telemetry confirms this                                 looks like Atlanta will have room for                                 the new order later today so she                                 schedules a new run to start as soon as                                 last night's batch completes fast                                 forward a few hours and the new order is                                 progressing Alexandre happens to be                                 looking at her console when she notices                                 something happening on the line the                                 predictive model has evaluated the                                 incoming telemetry stream and noticed an                                 anomaly the power supply on one of the                                 machines on the line has gone bad rather                                 than wait for the component to                                 completely fail as was done in the past                                 the system determines the optimal time                                 to schedule maintenance for the failing                                 machine based on production schedule                                 availability of parts and technicians                                 and severity of the problem a                                 maintenance window is scheduled later                                 today                                 parts are ordered and personnel are                                 notified when the parts come in Tim the                                 line technician arrives at the facility                                 and he opens up his maintenance tablet                                 his task list indicates which machine                                 needs service and he can review the                                 telemetry to confirm the diagnosis open                                 up the installation and repair manuals                                 on his tablet and get to work a few                                 hours later Tim has completed the job he                                 cleans up the area and places the                                 machine back in service and confirms the                                 repair looking at the unit's telemetry                                 as it comes back online                                 the next morning Bob and Alexandre                                 attend their daily stand-up meeting with                                 the department heads they review the                                 automated report from yesterday from                                 with the team Bob explains that by                                 proactively doing the maintenance the                                 company avoided a much greater loss than                                 if they'd waited until the machine                                 experienced a heart failure which could                                 have brought the line down for a much                                 longer time Bob is satisfied with the                                 results of the maintenance event and so                                 is the business Bob shows the leadership                                 team that while planned maintenance                                 costs have increased over the last six                                 months much more expensive unplanned                                 maintenance has dropped off                                 significantly ultimately reducing costs                                 and increasing business performance and                                 its reputation as a reliable vendor in                                 the industry a few weeks later the new                                 solution ends up saving lives and the                                 workers in the plant during one of the                                 runs a machine on the same line has a                                 catastrophic and unexpected failure that                                 threatens the safety of the whole                                 facility a rotor inside one of the                                 cooling units is jammed driving                                 temperatures to dangerous levels the                                 system intelligence driven by its                                 predictive model decides to immediately                                 halt the entire line and execute an                                 emergency shutdown again parts are                                 ordered technicians are notified and a                                 maintenance event is scheduled to begin                                 immediately to address the unplanned                                 event Tim the technician once again gets                                 to work and replaces the entire assembly                                 in a few hours                                 he places the new machine back in                                 service verifying the telemetry once                                 again and bringing production capacity                                 back to normal levels the order is                                 completed and the company's reputation                                 as a reliable vendor remains this                                 ability to execute machine learning                                 driven analytics across the data                                 management chain allows businesses to                                 design their needs in this case latency                                 is paramount the round trip to the data                                 center could have cost lives okay so as                                 I said we're going to have                                 the boots running at the club there's a                                 booth that is by the mine entrance we're                                 gonna have another pass at                                              and another one at the                                                morning please come out check out and                                 we'll show you how this is running under                                 the covers because as I said it's it's                                 working end to end                                 it's running analytics as the at the                                 different eight years and we should be                                 able to give you a much more insight                                 about how the whole solution is working                                 together thank you
