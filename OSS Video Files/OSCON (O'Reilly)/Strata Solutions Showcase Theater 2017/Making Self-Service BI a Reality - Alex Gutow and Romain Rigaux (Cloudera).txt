in our                                intelligence sequel editor Hugh and walk                                you through a live demo to showcase some                                of these advancements to help make your                                sequel developers more productive help                                enable greater data discovery and make                                sure that they can understand query                                recommendations and act more efficiently                                within the cluster so what we'll sort of                                show you today is how with cloud era it                                really enables this flexibility to                                consolidate multiple different silos of                                data to help get a complete view of your                                business                                of your data being able to converge this                                from all different sources across the                                business we're going to talk you through                                some intelligent data discovery how you                                can better enable your sequel developers                                to find new datasets understand what                                data to trust be able to perpetuate                                stewardship policies and tagging within                                the the sequel interface we'll walk you                                through and showcase some query                                assistance and recommendations that we                                built into the Hugh platform to better                                help with the query design being able to                                recommend come and join patterns                                understand what other folks are doing                                and understand when you might be writing                                a real query and be able to prevent                                against those and then finally we'll                                look at being able to share your queries                                with the rest of your team and be able                                to go even beyond sequel and open up the                                same data and result set to data science                                team maybe operationalize them for                                further uses so we'll walk through today                                for the scenario is we are a digital                                services company that has just launched                                a new streaming service and our                                executive wants to understand what the                                support cost has been has support                                increased since the launch of this                                product especially with our high value                                customers and then we also want to share                                this data with the marketing department                                and understand how these customers have                                interacted with different marketing                                campaigns                                be able to target the ones that maybe                                haven't had a great support experience                                so our goal is really to get this                                complete                                                                merging together information from                                Salesforce from customer usage as well                                as marketing them so like we mentioned                                will consolidate a number of different                                data sources from across the business                                and we'll walk you through all of these                                and so you'll see we're bringing in data                                from opportunities revenue case history                                product usage and then we're gonna look                                at some marketing campaign data one                                thing to call out is we are bringing                                these together into a shared storage                                layer and this can exist on premises                                using a storage systems such as HDFS or                                kudou and also natively within object                                stores such as with s                                                   at a high level before we dive into the                                demo what we're going to cover is we're                                gonna go through and walk through how                                you discover the the data to begin with                                this analysis we're going to start                                querying against Salesforce to                                understand what the Support Activity                                join that in with usage logs we will be                                using kudu here which allows for                                streaming logs and updates and then                                we're going to join it against the                                marketing a database and marketing                                activity to better understand campaign                                activities and then at the end of the                                day we're going to share it save and                                share it with the rest of our team hi                                alright thanks Alex I'm going to switch                                to the demo so what's really interesting                                is all this demo scenario is what we do                                internally at Cloudera to understand                                better or customer or users where our                                 support cost whereas an unhappy                                 customers we make it made it a bit more                                 generic with the scenario of                                 what's the impact of a recent features                                 in our product so usually the data                                 analyst will jump into his own editor or                                 command line and we first try to look                                 for its data where is the data so we can                                 have a lot of data bases I can contain                                 and read of tables so that's a lot of                                 data can also pose so I do file system                                 is free data on the object stores or the                                 as you data Lake on all those are                                 datasets directly from this UI on                                 another way of accessing the data is to                                 just search for it if we do a search for                                 example we'll get all the tables                                 matching usage why usage because it's a                                 tag the data was tagged by the end user                                 over the test award that way is easier                                 to group data to conserve on look them                                 up by with a real name the search also                                 supports like a Google search like fit a                                 search on tables database name so even                                 if you have like                                                      ton of tables you bet you'll be able to                                 get them quickly you can get previews                                 but one of the most interesting features                                 is just you can also just take it and                                 drag and drop it and then you can start                                 selecting it I'm just going to switch to                                 a query file that contains more                                 interesting queries and just actually                                 pick up my table again and list it I'll                                 show it that you can list it in the                                 assist sorry                                 stuck in a bit so I will just                                 go for it so I know the table is here so                                 opportunity so I just drag and drop it                                 on now we go well what data we want to                                 do the cookies to drill down to the data                                 on uncertain questions so what's the                                 impact of the launch one of the                                 interesting features which is happening                                 right now so I don't even run the query                                 that I'm getting some suggestions some                                 eyelids with recommendation so here if I                                 will agree with this query so huge query                                 time I like a lot of time or even arms a                                 crystal so it will get a recommendation                                 to add some filtering I will click the                                 smart LED editor will directly pull up                                 where you should tweak this query even                                 more interestingly it's going to bubble                                 up where what type of filters what type                                 of popular values you should use for                                 this query so those are the one with the                                 little stars if nobody did the queries                                 before you what are the most popular                                 columns for example so even without                                 knowing the query I can already the data                                 set match a call ready queried to use                                 this one or the next step Jolley data                                 sets have a lot of columns you have only                                                                                                      which is a lot so we don't know which                                 query which feel we should use same as                                 before those can be developed directly                                 just in the UI based on previous usage                                 so same again the available columns are                                 listed on the most popular ones are                                 purple top and this works with joins so                                 if you want to join multiple data sets                                 which is the point of this demo we get                                 the list of tables awaz joins before                                 and okay and then so I'm going to switch                                 so well values datasets I'm going to                                 switch to people queries that shows that                                 no turns other questions                                 what is a support usage after the                                 features our customer happy so how long                                 is it take to fix our problems so we can                                 get this global overview in one query                                 month by month so we can see that the                                 usage people are still happy the time                                 even going done and we can keep going                                 doing even customer by customer getting                                 trends up with their here their usage                                 based on the cell log usage so we can                                 get even final grain analysis on for the                                 last cookie were even joining now we                                 want to take action so joining our loca                                 or marketing data sets on we want to get                                 the emails the location of our customers
