	                              we had Devo are honored to be part of                               strata                                                       opportunity and thanks for being here                               my name is Guruji Hari and the principal                               business architect for Devo Devo is our                               cognitive a decision-making platform it                               my presentation would talk about how                               will you qualify your intuitions with                               cognitive decision-making so the                                high-level D was stands for data in                                wisdom out                                we know everything starts with data data                                is everywhere but it is uni-dimensional                                entity it resides in the customers                                dimensions in products in transactions                                which are promotions your point of sales                                etc so to give an example typically this                                data would be your customer name their                                age the times they come to the stores                                etc but stand alone they don't add lot                                of value to your business right so we go                                to the next level which is information                                information is really connecting the                                dots between those data sets it's about                                forging relationships so that you can                                really understand what your data means                                to you what what is it making sense to                                you so in this example with your data                                sets in different places you now know                                that whether there is a customer who                                frequently visits you he is well-to-do                                and he has some hobbies so you know a                                little bit more about them but is it                                something that you can really use in                                your business to make decisions well I                                don't think so                                then comes knowledge and knowledge is                                essentially connecting these information                                blocks together and help them                                contextually relate to so that you know                                what's really happening what's what's                                the reasoning behind it and that's where                                in this example if you really talk about                                knowledge                                you know this customer even further deep                                that he is of certain age he has certain                                hobbies he has a persona and that                                persona is pretty much the knowledge                                that you gain from your information                                blocks and the data behind it but                                knowledge with no action has                                has no value at the end of the day so                                what really means to business is the                                wisdom that they can actually apply by                                using these information and knowledge                                blocks in the domain that they can use                                giving them a holistic picture about                                their business and wisdom is all we                                aspire in our organization so in this                                example you can relate different sources                                of knowledge within your customers                                behavior the customer's dimensions and                                your product behaviors and dimensions                                and you if you really tie them together                                you have an actionable insight that you                                can now apply to your business and                                create value so enterprises are not                                different at all they have data sources                                across thousands and hundreds of sources                                that internal its external but when they                                combine when have a relationship                                together then they start making sense                                sense in terms of matrices sense in                                terms of reports bi which adds value but                                it's really not where the knowledge is                                and knowledge is the level of cognition                                where you can use these sets of                                information to deliver value now this                                value comes from knowing how they                                contribute to your business goals and                                objectives and these knowledge blocks                                pretty much forms your wisdom in form of                                opportunity cards and these opportunity                                cards are really the business use cases                                that you deploy and use them in your day                                to day business to make effective                                decisions that's the play we have in                                Divo so data in wisdom out is for us                                forms of opportunity cards that we can                                present to you so that they are                                actionable Bebo's philosophy is pretty                                much how can we move organizations from                                where they are to be opportunity                                different enterprises which means they                                can no longer miss those opportunities                                and take actions when those                                opportunities are presented to them                                the way B was able to do that is because                                it's a man-machine cognitive system Devo                                 as AI cognitive agent is really able to                                 interact with you like human it's a                                 guided dialogue based system it has no                                 inherent biases because it's based on                                 hypothesis hypothesis that it learns                                 from different sets of data massive data                                 it learns from your interactions it                                 learns from the decision that you take                                 and gets better over a bit of time and                                 articulates contextual insights which is                                 really the actionable aspect of Devo                                 which is presented in form of the                                 opportunity cards that are demonstrated                                 now Devo is based on our patented seal                                 cognitive framework seal stands for                                 sense explore act and learn so sense                                 essentially scans your business                                 environment continuously and looks for                                 opportunities when they happen it takes                                 the whole philosophy of digging into the                                 data upside down Explorer is all about                                 using that knowledge and wisdom to                                 understand your business context better                                 to understand what's the cause and                                 effect when they happen and really                                 optimize your decision making process                                 and the decision making process                                 culminates into action and we're Devo                                 acts through its cognitive process which                                 is really the actionable part of Devo it                                 presents opportunities which you can                                 apply to your business scenarios and                                 know what difference you made to your                                 organization but then that's not the                                 ultimate piece the ultimate piece for                                 any AI solution is to learn and learning                                 is essentially driving users behavior in                                 a way that they can mature on the                                 platform and incrementally use the                                 knowledge to optimize the decision                                 making process I will now present a                                 quick video to summarize what all I said                                 it is part of a do and it's true AI                                 capabilities and hope it gives you a                                 better sense                                 what if you were able to see hidden                                 business possibilities before they                                 happened imagine the opportunities that                                 have been missed because they were not                                 discovered in time                                 hi I am Devo your sixth sense to see                                 invisible opportunities and your                                 decision-making superpower to act on

                           here my optimization engine is always                                 working in the background to                                 continuously analyze complex data from a                                 variety of sources attuned to specific                                 issues that tend to arise in situations                                 like yours I initiate our interactions                                 by alerting you to potential problems                                 and opportunities for your business                                 before they occur

tweak and I'll show you the                                 potential impact of each decision in                                 real time I show evidence for each
