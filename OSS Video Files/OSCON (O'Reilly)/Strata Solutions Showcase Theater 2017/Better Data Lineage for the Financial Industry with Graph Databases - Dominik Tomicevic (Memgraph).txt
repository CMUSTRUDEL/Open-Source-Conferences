	                              hi everyone i'm dominic i'm the CEO and                               founder of mcgrath and now i'm gonna be                               showing you today how men graph helps                               fortune                                                            better manage their data using data                               lineage so the                                                     took away twenty two trillion dollars                               from the US economy according to the                               Government Accountability Office and it                                was mostly blame on the poor data                                quality which in turn enabled gave like                                poor transparency and very poor risk                                management and after that there were a                                lot of regulations put in place for                                financial institutions to better manage                                their data and provide more accurate                                reports and be able to prove the data                                and this is where we welcome to the use                                case of data lineage so the ANA lineage                                is a process of basically tracking the                                data from origin to consumption when it                                moves through various systems and gets                                manipulated with by multiple processes                                and basically seeing who modified it                                when and in what ways and there's the                                main thing for data lineage is to put                                your strategic objectives there's no                                easy way to tackle data lineage there's                                no universal way you have to do it four                                depending on what kind of data you store                                so you need to put your strategic                                objectives for data quality put in place                                set up processes and basically align the                                organization's to use these processes                                and basically have one truth                                representable truth of the data so the                                main three things from the technological                                solution that you want to have is to                                provide simplicity flexibility                                flexibility and speed                                so why relational databases might not be                                the best choice for this so it's very                                complex to model data if it's very                                complex                                imagine how                                tens of thousands of different tables                                figuring out joints not flexible when                                you're adding different system different                                processes you need to manage your schema                                you need to see how this reflects                                everything else and the main thing is                                when you're traversing complex paths and                                complex patterns it can be really slow                                doing                                dozens of joints per one created query                                so the performance really is not                                something that they can deliver so                                ideally you want to have easy and fast                                and to end business process and                                technology architecture mapping which is                                very suitable with graphs and                                performance and deeply connected data                                sets and cobble experience basically                                will craft databases shine so for you                                who don't know what graph database is                                basically they help you manage and store                                network data so connect the data data                                that's shown like this we have nodes you                                have relationships between your nodes                                instead of traditional tables and when                                you map your system into you know linear                                just give me a second I'm gonna show you                                a really quick demo that we did I think                                I mean I need to I might need to                                reposition myself better show the demo                                so we cannot show banking data but what                                we did is basically we've mapped the                                github repositories from the top                                organizations like Microsoft Google                                Intel stuff like that and basically                                commits their open source repositories                                on github so you can you can see here we                                have for example Microsoft we have                                Google Google has for example this                                repository when you click it you can see                                all of the commits all of the branches                                all of the people that have done that so                                you can see exactly in which ways the                                data was changed and if we trace was it                                manipulated you can click on the users                                get more interesting data back into it                                we couple of examples so one thing which                                is very interesting for me is this                                example right here should be loading so                                this one query enables you to get this                                and what this is interesting is you can                                see there are two organizations here                                there's Google and Microsoft and there                                are two people who in the same week                                 committed to two different repositories                                 even though some of the paths are very                                 long you can easily track this kind of                                 data and this is very crucial for                                 example in financial industry where you                                 have multiple departments that do                                 multiple things and have conflicts of                                 interest so they cannot share                                 information together so using this you                                 can basically map your processes and                                 find those we clean links those leaks of                                 data that you have and you can you can                                 basically improve your operational                                 efficiency it's so it's not only for for                                 tracking the data for compliance                                 purposes so one thing why we got this                                 contract with a financial institution                                 was that other solutions did not have                                 good enough performance so they tried                                 multiple graph offerings that are                                 currently present in the market none of                                 them could deliver the solution they                                 turned to us we're mem graph very high                                 performance graph database built from                                 the ground up using in memory storage                                 lock free data structures we really put                                 the emphasis on very low latency very                                 high throughput and we basically offer                                                                                                         on existing so over existing solutions                                 on use cases like that                                 so our basically our vision is speed                                 scale simplicity that's what we want to                                 provide to our customers and just to                                 give you a quick rundown of the things                                 so you can have not only you can you can                                 do data lineage and be compliant with                                 the regulations but you can also have                                 improved decision support so you can                                 better manage and better optimize your                                 processes make your organization's more                                 efficient which ultimately leads to                                 decreased capital costs which I know                                 that one bank saved two billion dollars                                 by implementing data lineage system and                                 just improving all of the processes                                 they're inside but it's not the only use                                 case with data lineage data lineage can                                 be used in insurance and healthcare as                                 well to manage data there and as a part                                 of graph databases there are much more                                 other use cases the graph databases can                                 do and I encourage you to visit our                                 booth number                                                    innovators pavilion and to see more demo
