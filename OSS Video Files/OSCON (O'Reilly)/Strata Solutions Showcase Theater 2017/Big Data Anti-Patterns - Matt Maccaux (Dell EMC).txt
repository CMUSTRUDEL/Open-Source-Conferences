	                              hello everybody my name is Matt McCoy                               and I'm with Dell EMC I am responsible                               for our big data consulting practice and                               today I'm gonna talk about anti-patterns                               so you've probably heard a bunch about                               best practices the gentleman from VMware                               just before us was talking about best                               practices to deploy Hadoop and Big Data                               technologies on VMware I'm gonna talk                                about the things you shouldn't do and                                you may recognize some of these in your                                enterprise and so before we do that we                                need to set the context because when we                                talk about Big Data there's certain                                things that come to mind I'm sure you                                all have an idea of what we mean about                                Big Data                                to set the context there are really two                                models that we need to think about when                                we talk about Big Data the first is what                                we call exploratory analytics and                                exploratory analytics is essentially                                what the data scientists and analysts do                                day in and day out they explore the data                                they build algorithms they refine the                                data it's usually done in a batch type                                mode and it's usually done over very                                very large datasets so that's what we                                call exploratory analytics the second                                mode for Big Data or the second model is                                operationalization and that's a word                                that we made up operationalization is                                essentially what you do when you're done                                exploring when you're done exploring                                you've built a report you've built an                                algorithm you need to build applications                                when you operationalize that that                                essentially means you need to put it in                                production so that it's useful to people                                it's generally a different type of data                                set it might be streaming and there's                                different applications I guess the way                                of differing thinking about these is                                this is when you hit the system at                                petabyte scale this is how you build the                                application that runs on your cell phone                                we're gonna talk about anti-patterns for                                exploratory analytics so before you                                raise up your hand and start yelling at                                me for examples of where this is not                                true remember that this is exploratory                                analytics so let's talk about the first                                anti-pattern the first anti-pattern is                                what we call too much Hadoop and you                                probably think we're gonna get lynched                                for doing that saying that at this show                                but essentially too much Hadoop means                                organization that is embarking on their                                big data journey thinks about their                                organization in terms of departments and                                those departments start deploying it do                                you get a cluster going and then you add                                a node and you add a node and you add                                another node and then the next                                department goes hey that seems pretty                                cool I want to spin up a cluster and the                                next apartment says hey I want to spin                                up a cluster                                well the only problem with doing that                                and this is very easy right you get                                bare-metal commodity servers you scale                                out infinitely the only problem with                                that is that when you've got lots of                                different clusters you end up with lots                                of different silos of data and this is                                problematic for a couple reasons one                                you're copying data across these various                                clusters so you've got duplicate data's                                in these clusters across the enterprise                                that's expensive if you're an                                infrastructure vendor you might like                                that if you're a software vendor you                                might like that but in terms of                                efficiency for your enterprise that's                                not such a good thing                                secondly if I need to query across all                                of these clusters there's probably                                different security profiles and it's                                really inefficient to do so so for                                exploratory analytics what we recommend                                is wherever possible combine all of your                                data into one single cluster that users                                can access that's the first anti-pattern                                and it makes me sad the second                                anti-pattern is what we call too much                                governance and too much governance goes                                something like this                                the organization has decided to build                                out that one pristine data lake they've                                 put all the data ingest jobs into place                                 you've got all of your data in one place                                 and then comes along your users your                                 data scientists your analysts your data                                 engineers and they say hey I really want                                 to get access to that lake but in order                                 for me to do my job as a data scientist                                 I need to bring my own data I want to                                 use the latest version of the tools and                                 the IT team goes wait a minute you want                                 to ingest data into my lake absolutely                                 not and so we see this across many                                 organizations these very pristine data                                 lakes where nobody has provided access                                 or one user at a time has provided                                 access for that exploratory analytics                                 use case so when you apply too much                                 governance in place you end up with                                 really inefficient use of your resources                                 the third anti-pattern is exactly the                                 opposite of that organizations that say                                 you know what everybody should just have                                 free rein on the data lake we're not                                 going to controller anything we're not                                 going to filter anything and think of                                 this as a busy intersection where you've                                 got all of your users all of the data                                 all flowing into the lake with no                                 traffic signs and everyone just says go                                 so the four V's and I guess there's more                                 V's now but the four V's the big data                                 are volume variety velocity veracity if                                 you throw all of your data into the lake                                 without any sort of controls and                                 cleansing                                 governance the veracity or how much you                                 can trust the data goes way way down and                                 there's nuances and there's areas in                                 between this but this is an important                                 one to think about the fourth                                 anti-pattern is very similar to the                                 first one as we deploy big data and                                 hadoop throughout the enterprise we tend                                 to do so a server at a time right we got                                 our commodity servers as the amount of                                 data goes up as the men our users and                                 the applications that go up we keep                                 adding these servers and this is fine to                                 a point but eventually we're gonna read                                 a reach of scalability and performance                                 threshold where for every terabyte of                                 data that's added in here will crack we                                 have to create well                                                      we want the resiliency and it becomes                                 very inefficient to manage becomes very                                 expensive and many organizations early                                 on in their big data deployments become                                 storage bounds this becomes very                                 problematic because if you need to do                                 patches and updates and add users to                                 this it's really really cumbersome and                                 if you're asking yourself if I built                                 this PowerPoint slide yes I did one                                 little line at a time the other problem                                 with this for exploratory analytics is                                 when we reach the petabyte scale lake                                 when we've got direct-attached storage                                 it becomes again very very inefficient                                 to do that and that makes me sad the                                 idea and if you were here for the VMware                                 session previously where we talked about                                 scale out and network attached storage                                 architectures when you get to that                                 petabyte scale it now starts to make                                 sense to think about decoupling your                                 storage from your computer so you can                                 scale those tiers independently for                                 exploratory analytics right this is not                                 the operationalization where you might                                 have architectures where you're putting                                 things in memory etc this is for the                                 exploring use cases the last                                 anti-pattern is what we call pet                                 projects and again this is for sort of                                 early adopters of big data technology                                 where an IT team traditionally is                                 looking to explore the latest in                                 technology whether it's Hadoop or spark                                 or tensorflow and they say hey I want to                                 go build a data Lake but I think I'm                                 gonna build it sort of based on the use                                 cases for IT so I'm gonna take some                                 files from my exchange server maybe for                                 my networking switches and I'm gonna try                                 and build algorithms that can predict                                 when exchange is going to fail and then                                 they do that they maybe come up with a                                 few percent of efficiency on that and                                 they turn around to the business and                                 they say hey look                                 we've got this great technology that you                                 the business should use and the business                                 goes what's a VDI I don't know what any
