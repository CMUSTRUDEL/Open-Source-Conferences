	                              thanks for coming Claudia is the chief                               scientist at distillery and I'm with                               Lenovo my name is Ed sudo one of the                               things is I wanted to kick this off is                               that years ago I was here in New York                               doing a conference on internet marketing                               this is around year                                                  one-to-one marketing my comment as I was                               speaking at the engagement was what a                                bunch of hooey how in the heck are you                                gonna find that one person to sell the                                product at the point of impulse the holy                                grail of marketing is impulse how do you                                get to that person on time on message                                with the right offer so one of the                                things as we fast forward into this new                                world of better Hardware better networks                                so what what is the compelling big data                                collection of information that is going                                to be collected sifted analyze and then                                drive machine learning algorithms to                                really deliver the product the message                                and the offer on time distillery has                                really come up with something that I                                think is quite amazing but I'm still                                mystified by it so Claudia what this                                distillery really do first of sorry to                                disappoint you despite the name it has                                nothing to do with booze it's actually                                all about distilling data so I joined                                kind of the ad tech world about seven                                years ago it became the chief scientist                                and the way I like to talk about it it's                                like that's my mom but that is my mom                                and she's one of the                                               consumers who hasn't figured out yet how                                to disable third-party cookies which                                basically means that we are being                                tracked all day long and so whenever you                                use your devices phones and desktops to                                consume any kind of digital content what                                increasingly happens is that option or                                opportunities to see an ad are sold in                                real time so as this page is loading and                                I know it's that person right now doing                                this talking of impulse there will be in                                real-time                                auction that is executed through an ad                                exchange and this is how at the end of                                the day                                end up getting on the order of                                    billion bid requests every day                                    billion times we are asked hey do you                                want to bid on showing this person an ad                                so we are working with brands all kinds                                from travel over automotive to even                                Lenovo and we are working on their                                behalf                                to find that right person in the right                                moment and then we have about a hundred                                milliseconds time to submit a bid for                                that opportunity and if we do win then                                we get to choose what you will see as an                                ad on the side and then we are working                                with the brand around measurement what                                are the things they want to achieve do                                they want to have people come to their                                website download a white paper and so on                                so when the consumer later on then                                interacts with the brand we would call                                this a conversion and that's what we                                would get credit for so that's basically                                what the stiller II does and this is                                also where these huge amounts of data                                every day come to us now of course this                                is not really me making a hundred                                billion decisions a day but this is                                really kind of the rise of AI and that's                                where my background coming out out of                                IBM Watson research with a lot of                                machine learning comes into play                                building this machinery that drives all                                of these decisions so this is a short                                timeline                                Distillery started out early on a                                     mostly in kind of social targeting but                                then we quickly discovered that machine                                learning is really the missing piece to                                deliver this value proposition that you                                mentioned people were tossing around and                                then over time we have broadened this                                into bringing in mobile as well and also                                breaching into more the intelligence                                side of things so talking of kind of                                scaling this business it started out                                back in                                                                a hundred million that was great that                                was like a huge milestone to us and then                                fast forward into                                                       looking at a daily volume of about                                     billion events Claudia how did you plan                                 for this kind of growth you don't plan I                                 mean you hope right you build something                                 and as a start-up you hope you'll miss                                 then don't so you design the machinery                                 that it's expandable but we had no                                 conception that this thing could get                                 that big and we've been kind of very                                 fortunate working with you to scale it                                 up to that point amazing so this is                                 really what's under the hood and I have                                 no time whatsoever to go into it but I'm                                 very happy to geek out completely there                                 are many components from data ingestion                                 to a lot of pre-processing of course                                 very close to my heart is the machine                                 learning side to it and using this model                                 then to score people in to execute so a                                 little bit here a deep dive into what                                 the data footprint really is what does                                 it mean hundred fifty billion events                                 it's really anytime your device does                                 something goes to a website we through                                 this integration with the bitstream get                                 an update on that these are the events                                 that helped us build user histories I                                 know exactly who you are                                 based on that I have a good guess where                                 you live because this is your home Wi-Fi                                 and I know which of the other devices                                 belong to you and the physical locations                                 you have been at because the bit                                 requests also tell me that so you know                                 my golf handicap I can probably predict                                 it if I wanted to so this is the various                                 data sources that play into this and                                 then ultimately what we do is that we                                 built these predictive models for all of                                 our clients this is one for Microsoft                                 Azure or for people who sign up for a                                 free trial and this is a fully automated                                 stack that builds on the order of you                                 know                                                                    what kind of surprises did you get                                 coming from it as an outcome these                                 different machine learning algorithms so                                 a very little story and I talked about                                 this at a previous strata the keynote                                 about all of a sudden my models got                                 really good like really really the                                 performance doubled and when we started                                 looking underneath what we identified is                                 these were actually not people because                                 we can't really predict people that well                                 they were all BOTS that were committing                                 some form of ad fraud conversion fraud                                 and click fraud of course they're easy                                 to predict but arguably not who you                                 wanted me to reach so that was one of                                 the things where we had to do some                                 adjustments to the system to account for                                 poor traffic in the                                 so here's one of these models when you                                 actually look a little bit under the                                 hood what's going on this model predicts                                 based on your digital activity the URL                                 to go to the likelihood that you will                                 show up in person and a mercedes benz                                 car dealership and these are the highest                                 scoring URLs and what you see here is                                 like yeah there seems to be some truth                                 to the fact that people buy cars after                                 buying real estate like now you have                                 this nice house with the garage you can                                 finally get the expensive car um you see                                 competitive research you also have some                                 appearance of very upscale fitness or                                 leave it to you how that correlates was                                 expensive course and guess what the                                 easiest to predict that you go to a car                                 dealership if you work there so and also                                 have the dealership employees doing some                                 kind of Legion in here so kind of really                                 cool to look at that so you know you can                                 process offers in                                                     less and the business model is around                                 serving ads and I think that's great how                                 did this discovery of enriched data                                 insights how did that change your                                 business model or has it so I mean it's                                 one thing to just have all of this                                 running under the hood and kind of geek                                 out of fun but yeah I find it always                                 fascinating to look under the hood to                                 learn what can this model tell you about                                 your consumers and there's a lot you                                 didn't know maybe you suspected some of                                 it you I get a hypothesis for so what                                 we're doing now strategically with the                                 company we think a lot more about what                                 kind of intelligent insights this can                                 provide rather than just running it to                                 show ads to people and give for every                                 dollar media spend the dollar value of                                 insights back to the client when they                                 are utilizing the system so this is                                 actually literally the stack that we                                 have and I think most of these machines                                 are from you so this is one of our data                                 centers we have two of them just give                                 you as you I find it fascinating it's it                                 went you know with the trend with a lot                                 of companies doing hybrid and cloud why                                 not the clown                                 so we actually played around with the                                 crowd when we bought a smaller company                                 what was in the cloud and we did the                                 math and the reality is if you run a                                 machinery at that scale you running your                                 machines                                                                 usage that's the first that's really                                 where the value proposition of the cloud                                 is is kind of giving you the scalability                                 up and down these models are estimated                                                                                                                                                                                 made these choices if you deal with                                 about a terabyte of data a day the                                 storage costs on a cloud if you want to                                 build these very elaborate histories is                                 really prohibitive and I'm not sure that                                 has changed much but so we made a very                                 conscious decision for that growth to                                 own our own so with that in mind the SLA                                 s are really a huge requirement for a                                 lot of your customers to deliver the                                 offer in time consistently and that                                 requires a high performance network of                                 servers and scalable hardware to give                                 you that kind of reliability scalability                                 and the powerful aspect to deliver the                                 business that you need online and so one                                 of the things as you combine the big                                 data solution that Lenovo can provide                                 through partners and customers and                                 companies like distillery it's well                                 worth the time and effort to do the                                 investigation thank you thank you very                                 much for you
