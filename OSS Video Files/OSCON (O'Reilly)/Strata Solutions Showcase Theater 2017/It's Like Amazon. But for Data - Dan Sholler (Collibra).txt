	                              Thanks so my name is Dan shoulr I'm with                               Calibra and I wanted to talk to you                               today about data catalogs and I the                               title of this presentation is it's like                               Amazon only for data because the                               fundamental question that almost any                               business user has when they start                               looking at your internal systems of                               course is why aren't they easy to use                                right I can find anything using Amazon I                                can find anything using Google you know                                it's it's easy why can't I find stuff                                here in the organization why don't why                                you know why is that so hard and I think                                you know part of it has been that                                there's a lot of reasons for that there                                are technological reasons for it there                                are organizational reasons for it but I                                think also that it's been there's been a                                change in the way we think about what we                                need to do with data you know                                historically data was something that was                                a side effect of process automation it                                was things that you know it was the                                responsibility of a certain I'll call                                them high priests if you will to make                                sense out of the data and today there's                                much more of a sense among everyone the                                data is valuable data is useful and if I                                can get it into everyone's hands I can                                use it however so we've we've tried some                                solutions to this problem but the                                solutions have tended to be too narrow                                too siloed too focused on individual the                                needs of individual groups or individual                                problems in order to create a good                                solution so what we've ended up with is                                a process that's just really broken you                                know if I go to search for data and this                                this by the way is an example of                                something that I have done personally in                                my own life in in the past life you know                                you you look for the data you look for                                it on the information portal you can't                                find it there you see a bunch of reports                                that aren't the right thing or they're                                not accurate enough or whatever it is                                right so then you ask the other people                                in your department when they get back                                from lunch you know what do you used to                                find this out oh I don't know I don't                                look at that one I look at this other                                thing but it's not the same right you                                know that doesn't work so then I say AHA                                I know someone in accounting who                                probably looks at this same information                                let me call them I call him and he says                                well maybe that's not the you know maybe                                that's not the the customer lifetime                                value data but maybe it's                                you know the account valuation over time                                and you should look for things that's to                                have a count valuation in them they give                                you synonyms for what you're doing so                                you take a look for those you search the                                information portals in it you know you                                look at them for account valuation you                                discover that there are                                                 account valuation and them and that's                                not very helpful you can't sort through                                all that so then you then you call some                                other contact an ite right they point                                you to a bunch of database schemas that                                you might want to do you go back to the                                portal and look for reports there really                                think UE we've been here right it's just                                on it's endless it's a painful painful                                process and the question is you know why                                is it such a painful process I mean you                                I don't know what size organization                                you're in but you probably don't have as                                many bits of data on your in your                                process as Amazon has products in their                                in their view so why can we not find the                                data and we can't find the products a                                part of it is that we don't have the                                tools to locate information and part of                                it is that we don't have enough                                information about those things to make                                them easily distinguishable and this is                                where the data catalog comes in the data                                catalog has got to be a mechanism that                                provides that same kind of experience                                that that consumer like Amazon like                                experience for data it should lead users                                to knowledge as you know what Amazon                                does for you is it leads you you know it                                always has that nice big button that                                says put it in the cart buy it now right                                 that's that's what's there because                                 that's the outcome that they want on                                 Amazon the outcome that you want for                                 your catalog is for the user to have in                                 front of them the information that they                                 need in order to make their decision to                                 make create their plan to do what it is                                 that they're trying to do so the catalog                                 needs to lead users to knowledge that                                 means I need to be able to find in                                 provision trustworthy and appropriate                                 information and I need to be able to                                 also find things that are not                                 necessarily DITA existing existing                                 reports existing models you know                                 components of analytical programs you                                 know MapReduce jobs whatever it is I                                 mean things that manipulate that data                                 that can help me to get to that outcome                                 it also has to be more than what's there                                 because there's a there's an aspect to                                 the use of data that contributes to the                                 information about the data the                                 same way that if you see for example                                 that one product has a five-star reports                                 from in Amazon it's five stars from                                    users and another one has four and a                                 half stars but it's got that from                                     users I don't know about you but I                                 typically judge that four and a half                                 star rating a lot higher than I would                                 judge that five star rating right                                 because it comes from more people more                                 people have used it therefore the                                 aggregate knowledge that they have is                                 going to be more comprehensive about it                                 than not so it needs to be part of a                                 governance process where we continually                                 collect knowledge about the data and                                 about how the data is used and what the                                 data is for and ultimately it also can't                                 be something that's done in a silo you                                 know we've seen this we've seen people                                 try it and what they end up with is a                                 much sexier list you know there's a much                                 cooler list of things to do it's really                                 great but you need to be able to give                                 people a means of exploring data outside                                 the world that they're familiar with you                                 know you want to you want to focus them                                 on the on the data that they're most                                 likely to use but you have to give them                                 pathways to look at other related                                 information because if you don't they're                                 not going to be able to come up with new                                 insight and you know the the the big                                 step functions in the value of our data                                 and the use of our data come from the                                 places where I'm able to combine                                 information from different parts of the                                 business that weren't looked at in that                                 way before                                 and create new insight from them right                                 and the information in the catalog can't                                 just be like a random collection of                                 stuff it has to be you know you have to                                 be able to identify whether or not this                                 information is trustworthy in the                                 context of what I'm doing for it now                                 that definition of trustworthy is going                                 to change with the context but it needs                                 to be done so that's really what the                                 data catalog is about now we here at                                 calibra have looked at what Amazon is                                 actually providing you and we've done a                                 lot of work with our data catalog                                 automation to provide that same kind of                                 capability and if you break it down                                 there's really five things that you've                                 got there right one of them is you know                                 the ability to search with semantics and                                 part of our system has semantic models                                 definitions business terminology all                                 those types of things that can be                                 associated with                                 the information and with the data so                                 that you can do that kind of semantic                                 searching and and create those those                                 associations it needs to make                                 intelligent recommendations and we you                                 know we have a machine learning                                 capability that that identifies what                                 data sets you might be interested in                                 based on the things that other people do                                 the types of work that they do with data                                 the role that you have and the other                                 people you know typical kinds of things                                 other people people who have shopped for                                 this have also shopped for that right                                 that's the that's the the model you need                                 to understand something about the                                 quality of data obviously that's that's                                 you know it's a primary metric for us to                                 determine suitability you and so we                                 allow the organization to aggregate                                 everything that they have about quality                                 from all different quality scanners and                                 custom programs or whatever else you use                                 to do that bring it together in one                                 place and just view it very simply so                                 business user can understand it I need                                 to be able to drill down into the data                                 right I don't need to see all the                                 lineage the entire expanded you know                                 every step that it took to get from here                                 to there but I need to be able to know                                 where did this data come from you know                                 who else has used it are there any                                 problems reported with it all those                                 kinds of relationships need to be                                 visible to me in a very very                                 straightforward way so I can know what                                 happens and finally I need to be able to                                 access that data now provisioning is                                 more than just the idea of delivering                                 some data to me right it's actually in a                                 lot of cases it's at kind of some what                                 can be a somewhat complex process I may                                 need to get approval to use this data                                 right if I'm provisioning data                                 particularly from provisioning data to                                 partners or customers or something like                                 that I may need to have them sign a data                                 sharing agreement before I give it to                                 them right you know there's all sorts of                                 different things that may happen there                                 so we need to have a flexible process                                 for managing the provisioning of that                                 data these are just some pictures of                                 what happens with a catalog here this is                                 the card view of a catalog we've got a                                 live view over there in our booth                                       believe it is right there if anyone                                 wants to see more stuff but you can see                                 this is this is a recommendations page                                 its recommendations up there you could                                 flip to see the complete set of data                                 sets and filter on that and do all that                                 but that's you know we want to try to                                 drive you to recommendations we will                                 very visibly flag things that have been                                 through an approval process right so                                 that's um you know if you have some type                                 of approval process to say this is the                                 official source of some data then those                                 will show up with those big green flags                                 on trying to encourage people to use the                                 stuff that they're supposed to use and                                 you can see that I have other stuff here                                 so I have another custom another there's                                 a customer name data set that's one of                                 the approvals ones and then I have my                                 own customer data set over here that I                                 just created for my own purposes and                                 that's fine and you know I probably that                                 probably will not appear in anyone elses                                 view right because it's it's only ever                                 gets used by me and it's you know it's                                 maybe a subset of what's going on in                                 terms of that detail drill down what you                                 do what you get is something like this I                                 have here a this is actually a report                                 about customer lifetime value right                                 that's part of a sales operations                                 management reporting process that's                                 owned by the operations department that                                 report come has information that comes                                 from these these attribute these                                 elements here they have all have quality                                 scores overlaid on them in this                                 particular view and I can change this                                 view up to show anything that I want at                                 any level of detail and then I can see                                 that these things come from the hadoop                                 system for enterprise the enterprise                                 technology hadoop system except for the                                 customer record which comes from our crm                                 system as you would expect very                                 straightforward very simple that data                                 can be expanded you can get profiling                                 information about your data all of these                                 things are things that you need to know                                 as detail to understand data to choose                                 the right appropriate things when you                                 find it in a catalog and finally there's                                 a there's a set of things I'm gonna skip                                 over something here because I know we're                                 getting low on time but for all of that                                 information to be visible to you the                                 only way that can happen is if there is                                 some kind of governance process that                                 collects that information and the                                 process that organ is that really                                 leading organizations take today is one                                 where every time you use the information                                 you collect more about it right so when                                 someone puts it in the system you ask                                 them a few simple questions what is it                                 what is it for how you know how are you                                 gonna use it every time I use it what                                 are you using it for why are you doing                                 this                                 obviously there's information you can                                 get that structural that you can just                                 mechanically pull out but what you want                                 to try to do is to create a virtuous                                 circle where I discover information I                                 evaluate whether it's appropriate                                 using in a particular context I may                                 enrich it for use within that particular                                 context and then I may you know with                                 that enriched data that report whatever                                 I built that model I put it back in the                                 system I say hey this is now a model for                                 doing that here here you know you might                                 be interested in it                                 so I refer it to other people and then                                 that makes it more discoverable by other                                 folks and so forth you create a virtuous                                 cycle if you can incorporate governance                                 with the discovery and use and                                 cataloging of data and that's really how                                 we at calibra believe that this process                                 should work and if you'd like to see                                 more about that please come and visit us                                 my name is Dan Schuler and thank you all                                 for listening have a great day
