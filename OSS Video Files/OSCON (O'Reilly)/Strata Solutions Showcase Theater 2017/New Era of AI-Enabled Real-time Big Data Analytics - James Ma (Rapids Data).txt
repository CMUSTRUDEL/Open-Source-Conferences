	                              my presentation new era of AI enabled                               real-time big data analytics                               first of all our company name poori data                               technology and our product name is rapid                               data and our vision is to become the                               world's leading real-time big data                               analytics platform my name James MA                               the chief solution architect of Ravis                               data so we have presence board data                                company has presence in u.s. second                                Valley and Sydney New Delhi and mainly                                China you know RT centers and offices in                                all of those places okay so what we do                                we are a real-time analysis and we think                                real-time analysis with intelligence is                                a direction of big data platforms so if                                you look at the big data ecosystems                                today you're gonna see you know loosely                                we can separate into four categories                                from you know from bottom-up traditional                                database for storage and then on top of                                that you can have real-time analytic                                platform represent relatives are you                                know ASAP Hana spark sequel and then                                further you're gonna have machine                                learning capabilities on top of that                                for example sparks email live Google                                Maheu so in our case is a rapid Atta and                                then on top that further you're going to                                have visualization platforms you know                                for example tableau click those are you                                know familiar products so reps data we                                really cutting from the analytic cluster                                support the business demand and we have                                the Flex support online extension you                                can really be extended from the storage                                and the DB marina up to the algorithm                                and                                down to the storage so or all of the                                arena we our products can rock across                                okay so we we our platform folks on Big                                Data real-time processing and provide                                Big Data real-time analytics solutions                                you can see the core our product is rep                                is DV which is a fully memory data                                processing engine and there's a                                connector based Federation                                infrastructure which we can we can                                linking all kinds of data source                                integration and also we have stream DB                                which is memory stream data analysis                                engine and also in the algorithm arena                                we have reps DB parallel R which is a                                distributed RNG so I'm gonna in the                                Showcase customer case later I'm gonna                                touch about all those those products ok                                our Showcase customer China Unicom so                                China Unicom is a Chinese state-owned                                Cherokee Nation operator it is the                                world's fourth largest mobile service                                provider by subscriber base and it it's                                it the requirement of this customer is                                pretty fast sophisticated it has it has                                requirements to mine sacrifice a                                behavior data based on all carrier data                                flow it need to detect fraud at                                real-time evaluation and user machine                                behavior data modeling and also                                real-time ad hoc queries                                so at the the first level our raps that                                rap is DB which is a big data real-time                                complicated query kicks in so the                                challenge is you know this this customer                                as as one of the largest carrier in                                China it has massive data volume                                hundreds of millions messages per day                                real-time complicated query processing                                requirements and in the past what they                                have so they have traditional databases                                and they also you know introduced in                                Hadoop with MapReduce processing and a                                hive and HBase those kind of things                                right so but still Hadoop is a batch                                oriented processing platform which means                                it might take minutes or even hours to                                process their massive data volume in                                that case so reps DB in our case are our                                solution when all that way our products                                are Korean we can provide in first of                                all distributed an in-memory computing                                and we can run real time completely                                query capability which we can run full                                TCH and the nine percent of TPC D s as a                                benchmark so eventually we are able to                                bring down their query processing time                                from hours to minutes and also provides                                a very good reference point for                                achieving second level processing                                eventually                                 here we have a benchmark in comparison                                 with using TP CH benchmark suite so in                                 compared with Oracle                                                    is a with wonder the best right                                 traditional disk space to database a                                 Rhapsody B is two times faster in case                                 of small data and in large volume data                                 case we are                                                           compared to the open source world a                                  test sparks equal we are tens to tons of                                 times faster                                 okay so now we have reps DB to solve                                 their massive data processing the base                                 needs the second level challenge is they                                 have a lot of existing data systems that                                 they want to utilize an integrator ways                                 for example they have a massive amount                                 of dpi data - they would like to fully                                 tap the value of so that's a challenge                                 and so in the in this case our                                 Federation in flutter kicks in and in                                 our solution reps data connector based                                 Federation we can really implement                                 seamlessly integrated query across all                                 kinds of data sources you can see here                                 the red is is like in a real-time data                                 and you can you can you can think of                                 that as a hot data and the middle the                                 yellow one is warm data and the blue one                                 is coded data so in one query you can                                 really create a cross in one join you                                 can you can you can create selected data                                 from the hot data in you know the rap is                                 DB and join you know probably some some                                 data from traditional databases which is                                 a which is kind of a warm data and then                                 you can join code data you know maybe                                 statistics from from the past week and                                 even from past months you store it in                                 Hadoop HDFS so it can really fully truly                                 separate hot warm and cold data and then                                 you can still run across query across                                 all those different platforms and bring                                 it into one query                                 okay so one of the hard data I've just                                 just talk about is stream DB it's just                                 extremely high speed data streams which                                 can be distributed too fast in memory                                 and a cluster for real-time processing                                 and analysis and so our stream TV can                                 support all kinds of streaming window                                 clearing processing okay so now you have                                 based basic data processing capabilities                                 and then Federation to to be able to                                 bring capably to join across all kinds                                 of data in your in your enterprise and                                 also you're facing the challenge of                                 further intelligence the intelligence                                 challenging so you know the challenge                                 you're going to be in in the in the case                                 of this customer China Unicom they have                                 requirement to to do natural language                                 semantic analysis and tax search                                 capability and the use cases including                                 you know user portrait credit precision                                 marketing cost Center and other                                 scenarios and in this case our rapid                                 parallel our kicks in and our solution                                 is with rapid are with parallel are                                 which is truly distributed in their base                                 our platform it has you know rich                                 modeling algorithms support of                                 supporting our in-memory data analysis                                 capability of graph is DB can really                                 meet the needs of various complex modern                                 requirements successfully                                 talk about parallel our it is a or in                                 memory are modeling parallel algorithm                                 libraries currently we support for                                 categories                                                            you know across statistical analysis                                 dimensionality reduction machine                                 learning and deep learning                                 so the the the showcase customer is                                 China Unicom                                 is is telecom industry but you can see                                 our solution can really expand it to
