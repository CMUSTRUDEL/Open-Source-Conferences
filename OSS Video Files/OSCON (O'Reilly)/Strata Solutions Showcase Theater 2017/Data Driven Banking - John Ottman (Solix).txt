	                              my name is John aunt Minn I'm the                               executive chairman of Sollux                               technologies and I'd like to talk to you                               today about data-driven banking for                               those of you that may not know us Sollux                               technologies was founded in                                          headquartered in Santa Clara California                               have about                                                           mission statement as a company is to                                organize the world's enterprise                                information so within the enterprise                                we're we're about enterprise data                                management we have well over a thousand                                customers and our sales and service                                partners are pretty much all around here                                in the in the show and the exhibit floor                                and our Big Data partners in particular                                the ones we run on we run on cloud era                                we run on harden works we learn a map                                our Oracle Amazon in raw patchy in terms                                of our partnerships just one other point                                about Sollux you know we are recognized                                by Gartner as the leader in structured                                data archiving and as you're going to                                see hopefully at the end of this                                presentation why that's extremely                                important but this was a this was a big                                accreditation for Sollux so you know                                when we're talking about data-driven                                banking or if we're talking about                                data-driven enterprise in general or                                really for in any industry probably the                                biggest issue that everybody's facing                                today is the date of growth crisis you                                can't hardly pick up a IT publication                                today and not read about the fantastic                                growth of structured data unstructured                                data semi structured data and it poses                                incredible challenges to IT in terms of                                the performance of the production                                applications that are doing OLTP                                processing in terms of managing risk and                                compliance and also driving costs crazy                                people say storage is cheap but storage                                really is not cheap when you're talking                                about petabytes and petabytes and                                petabytes growing at a very very rapid                                rate and and in addition to the data                                growth crisis particularly in the                                banking arena                                compliance has become a major major                                challenge for everybody and what we see                                in banking in particular is very rapid                                rise in regulatory fees actually rising                                at a much faster clip than revenues and                                profits at banks and the expanded scope                                of compliance new compliance guidelines                                coming out on a regular basis Bank                                Secrecy Act any money laundering Act in                                addition to many of the older ones like                                socks and whatnot that we've all been                                dealing with for a long time the                                compliance is a major major issue and                                we've got to be able to integrate                                compliance into overall compliance                                frameworks that an entire organization                                might be might be using and we have to                                transform compliance from just an                                advisory function into an active                                participation and an active risk                                management system so compliance becomes                                a critical critical component to a                                data-driven banking strategy so if you                                think about data-driven banking and                                really what is it all about if you think                                about a large banking institution what                                what it's typically characterized is by                                large silos of application-specific                                information be it payment systems you                                know within retail banking or commercial                                banking or investment management there's                                there's large databases and many of them                                transaction processing databases and the                                difficulty in in establishing a                                data-driven banking application is to be                                able to get at this data so that it can                                drive the new data-driven applications                                that are really really important to the                                business mobile payments next generation                                personal financial systems peer-to-peer                                environments FinTech blockchain                                applications all of these new                                applications are what we think of when                                we talk about data-driven banking so the                                enabler of data-driven banking is to be                                able to capture the transactional data                                in these silos and be able to provide                                them and feed them to these downstream                                often no sea                                 applications or advanced analytics                                 applications it's it's very similar to                                 what ERP was many many years ago by                                 consolidating accounts receivable                                 accounts payable and to be able to have                                 an active general ledger now if you look                                 at data-driven banking you see these                                 same silos of information and they've                                 got to be consolidated into a common                                 repository so when you think about                                 consolidating these silos into a common                                 repository the first thing that comes to                                 mind is is like well it's not all                                 structured data anymore I mean it used                                 to be very very much a structured data                                 thing but now we're talking about semi                                 structured data we're talking about                                 images we're talking about video we're                                 talking about email we're talking about                                 file servers critical data of                                 information that is across the                                 enterprise and what Sollux has done is                                 we've positioned a construct that we                                 call the enterprise then we call the                                 enterprise business record within a all                                 structured data world you think of a                                 complete business object so what's my                                 customer who is a customer and a                                 complete business object would include                                 all of the attributes of that customer                                 within an enterprise business record                                 structure we expand the complete                                 business object to include                                 unstructured and semi-structured                                 components of data to build a richer                                 data object and also to be able to take                                 structured data and denormalize it into                                 a flattened file so it can be text                                 searched and for many many years the                                 holy grail of relational database has                                 been you know to be able to get at the                                 information particularly in the sense of                                 text searching and it's always been a                                 challenge but today it's actually                                 possible through enterprise business                                 records to text search structured data                                 so it all comes together in what we call                                 a common data platform approach we call                                 it CDP and think of CDP very similar to                                 you used to think of ERP ERP would take                                 your accounts receivable your accounts                                 payable merge them together in a                                 concurrent process and you have an                                 active general ledger now we're talking                                 about taking these silos of very                                 different information                                 across the enterprise not just ERP but                                 many many other application areas as                                 well and being able to ingest them in in                                 in in a way that is not just a copy but                                 is also a move now move is very                                 different and distinct from a copy and                                 that a move is actually involving a                                 purge of source data and then a                                 validation that that purge was done                                 correctly why is this important because                                 huge cost is is removed when you're able                                 to this is what we're talking about                                 archiving when you're able to archive a                                 production system so a move is an                                 awesome ingestion strategy in addition                                 to a copy now this common data platform                                 is really all about establishing an                                 enterprise archive or an enterprise data                                 Lake and using copy or move techniques                                 to get the data in now once the data is                                 in another critical component is to be                                 able to manage it for compliance and so                                 we have a governance workbench that goes                                 after the compliance issues and then an                                 analyst workbench is is the discovery                                 environment and in there is a an API                                 that we've made available so that not                                 just the Sollux analyst workbench is                                 able to discover data in this common                                 data platform but it's also an API                                 that's available for all of our                                 third-party partners so take a closer                                 look at this Sollux object workbench                                 what you wanted to be able to do is is                                 move copy in transform all three and and                                 and the move I mentioned is critical but                                 also the transform can be critical as                                 well depending on what type of data                                 formats that you're looking to establish                                 is it HDFS is it s                                                   know where do you best want to have this                                 data is it going to be flattened into an                                 enterprise business record and                                 denormalize so it's accessible for text                                 search these are critical components and                                 what we're building with our customers                                 and with our partners are specific                                 connectors in the banking arena for                                 custom apps that you may you may have                                 running but also core                                 banking systems such as Oracle or s AP                                 or Hogan and banking CRM systems such as                                 Siebel banking ERP systems or loan                                 systems loan origination systems so what                                 we're doing whether it's mainframe based                                 or if it's other structured database                                 based or even unstructured databases                                 we're building specific connectors to                                 each one of these databases so that the                                 ingestion strategy think of it as                                 archiving as a service can be done as                                 easily as possible                                 the Sollux common data platform also has                                 a data governance workbench and and this                                 is about understanding the complete                                 lifecycle of your data from when data is                                 created to when it's finally deleted the                                 first thing we have to do is discover                                 data you know do you know what data you                                 have that's sensitive                                 do you know what data in a certain                                 format so buying it by able to go in and                                 scan this data we can we can discover                                 and then classify data and once we can                                 classify the data we can establish                                 policies for managing that data                                 throughout its lifecycle meaning meaning                                 how long do you want it to be available                                 to WHO how long should it be running on                                 one platform versus moved off to another                                 platform so being able to set policies                                 and have a policy driven data governance                                 platform is critical it also is where                                 you're going to manage your security                                 whether the Sollux common data platform                                 is encrypted end-to-end with HTTP                                 support end to end as well as encryption                                 at rest access control policies also                                 implemented on a privileged basis and                                 then we need to know what's the                                 retention policy for this data how long                                 do we want to own this data and it's and                                 once we're finished owning it when                                 should it be deleted and can we confirm                                 that it was deleted and what if there's                                 a legal hold on certain data or what if                                 for instance in in in certain cases we                                 absolutely want to be forgotten we have                                 to delete data so all of these                                 capabilities are built into the Sollux                                 data governance workbench in terms of                                 discovering data which is really the                                 application area that that is the most                                 meaningful these this is the advanced                                 analytics side or the downstream no                                 sequel side what we're doing now is we                                 remember we're taking all this data                                 we're bringing it together in one common                                 repository and enabling a what we call                                 schema on-demand capability schema on                                 read capability where we're downstream                                 no sequel applications can go go find                                 the data as is and read it into their                                 application it's an apply schema as                                 necessary as part of that application                                 these are the next-generation payment                                 the next-generation FinTech the                                 next-generation mobile apps that that                                 the banking industry is building and to                                 be able to get access to all of this                                 data and find it all in one place                                 maintain governance and control over it                                 is a critical capability and frankly in                                 order to enable a data-driven bank you                                 know if you are not able to establish a                                 common data platform approach for the                                 data in the bank it's going to be almost                                 impossible to get to these next                                 generation applications in terms of use                                 cases we have one very very large Bank                                 that's here in the audience today that                                 is is is using it for many of these same                                 same reasons they're starting with                                 archive on-demand that archive as a                                 service is what they call it internally                                 as their ingestion strategy this is how                                 you get all the diverse data into this                                 common repository and they're using it                                 for things like application retirement                                 to retire old old legacy systems and                                 also to establish data lakes to enable                                 these next generation data driven                                 applications                                 another Bank over in Europe is is it's                                 doing something very similar they were                                 originally just a customer of our prior                                 generation archiving solution and today                                 they're doing application retirement on                                 an enterprise-wide basis so that's the                                 presentation for that for today thank                                 you very much please visit us at Sollux
