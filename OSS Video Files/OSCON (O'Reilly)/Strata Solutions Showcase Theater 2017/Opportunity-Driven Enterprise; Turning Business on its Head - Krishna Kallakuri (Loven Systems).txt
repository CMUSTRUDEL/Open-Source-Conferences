	                              good evening everybody thank you all for                               joining us this evening my name is                               Krishna I am one of the founders and the                               president at a company called Avant                               systems we actually developed our first                               product called Devo which is a cognitive                               station making platform so even before I                               get started                               justifying the title about opportunity                                driven enterprise I like to quickly walk                                you through the journey from data to                                wisdoms you know how do you evolve from                                data to wisdom right so pretty much                                everybody sits on wide variety of data                                sources in the enterprise we all know                                that right so what do we typically do                                with this data right so when you look at                                different data sources we consume some                                information right when we consume some                                information that typically becomes you                                know your data that becomes most usable                                that is called information right so                                let's say in this scenario you're                                looking at gross margin you're looking                                at sales or you looking at comparative                                shares right but when you start                                collecting you know the pieces of                                information together you eventually                                start building something like this right                                you know the relationships between the                                different data points in the enterprise                                right so when you start connecting the                                dots between you know the sales or the                                sales growth or you're looking at the                                growth rate you could literally call                                this as knowledge right so when you                                start you know putting together these                                different pieces of knowledge together                                you know this is what we typically look                                at right we identify the patterns or the                                relationships on you know what is likely                                to sell right why is a customer inclined                                to purchase a certain product or you                                know what promotion is going to work                                well so when you start you know putting                                all putting the different blocks                                together of knowledge and when you apply                                a context to it right in this scenario                                you know you apply whether or you look                                at                                the behavior of the user when you start                                applying an external context to your                                pieces of knowledge that eventually                                becomes wisdom right so this is exactly                                you know what we try to deliver in the                                product here at Devo so what we have                                done differently here is you know taking                                this wisdom right packaging pieces of                                wisdom together and creating an                                opportunity for the business is what we                                try to demonstrate here at devotes so                                when you start looking at you know the                                different pieces of wisdom how do you                                package it together right so can it help                                solve a specific business problem or can                                it help you solve a specific business                                use case is the whole premise around you                                know do and this is what we typically                                try to demonstrate and what we what we                                do differently is we apply the                                principles of cognitive computing on how                                can we bring wisdom back to the business                                and putting business solutions first you                                know so this is what we call it as the                                opportunity framework where we are                                taking all the wisdom out of your data                                and then putting it back to the business                                user is what we typically do here so at                                a very high level Devo is a cognitive                                addition making platform so it has three                                key characteristics the first                                characteristic is really you know the                                ability for you know a human to interact                                with the machine in a natural language                                where the machine is able to understand                                the business context behind the question                                and most importantly it is also able to                                provide the contextual insight as well                                so that is the first characteristic and                                the second one is it it does produce any                                kind of insights based on hypothesis and                                evidence and the last one is like I just                                described it creates these blocks of                                wisdom into a framework called                                opportunity framework so these are the                                three key principles that we have                                otherwise Devoy is called data in wisdom                                out at a high level you know so to give                                you how the system works at a high level                                 so technically behind-the-scenes Devo is                                 working in the background trying to talk                                 to a number of data sources you                                 trying to unfold the business context                                 behind the data and then present it in                                 the form of a business opportunity is                                 how do really works and to give you a                                 perspective you know the way it can                                 sense the opportunities out of the data                                 and create blocks of wisdom and have the                                 business explore what those                                 opportunities are and most importantly                                 when you talk about an AI class system                                 the true art of machine learning should                                 come back from the user too so the                                 system learns from the user on the                                 business aspect of the application so                                 that's a very important characteristic                                 for Devo otherwise you know to give you                                 a full perspective about Devo it is                                 fully unable to produce any kind of                                 contextual rich insights based on the                                 data it consumes on a day to day basis                                 so let me play a quick video that should                                 give you a good feel about how the                                 system should work at a high level every                                 year an estimated                                                        revenue in North America is lost                                 just from the cost of excess stock stock                                 levels always need to be brought down to                                 make room on the shelves for new                                 products and collections otherwise the                                 need for quick clearance forces big                                 discounts and heavy losses meet Emily VP                                 of supply chain management her task to                                 bring stock levels down by                                               spring collection arrives as the opening                                 day steadily approaches she has to                                 figure out the most effective way to                                 reduce her excess stock and maximize                                 revenue recovery in a moment like this                                 Emily wishes she had an extra six weeks                                 to resolve the situation or better yet a                                 sixth sense to predict her excess stock                                 build-up but Emily does have a secret                                 weapon on her side and it's Devo her                                 cognitive sixth sense                                 vul has been running in the background

insights about its causes and                                 potential impact after exploring                                 countless options and variations Devo                                 presents a strategy that would result in                                 a revenue                                 recovery of                                                             a hundred and seventy two units to her                                 Soho location which has an urgent                                 requirement as well as marking down                                    units

being thorough she                                 wants to know the potential outcome of                                 this strategy                                 what will the forecasted sales look like                                 over the following three months                                 how will the markdown impact related                                 products the sheer number

will have to wait                                 several nail-biting weeks to receive the                                 data back from her consultants but the

patience oh let me try                                 to give you a live demo of the                                 application so I'm really not sure how                                 fast the Internet is but please bear                                 with me we'll give it a shot here                                 so essentially what you're looking at                                 here is you know the internet connection                                 seems to be very slow we're having a                                 good day                                 last time we interacted you were looking                                 at sales performance profitability                                 markdown and excess stock scenario                                 across stores so it starts with                                 cognition helps the user understand you                                 know where did he leave the last time                                 when he interacted with the system you                                 know how did he talk to the system in                                 what capacity but otherwise to give you                                 a quick example which product is likely                                 to sell well with crossbody bags                                 following products are likely to sell                                 with crossbody bags I see stronger                                 affinities for same or similar products                                 in bags would you be interested the                                 selling propensity of shoulder bags with                                 aviator sunglasses is higher when                                 bundled at a price fan of $                                            so again running out of time here this                                 is how it delivers rich contextual                                 insights and this is what Devoy is all                                 about thank you again thank you all for                                 joining me this evening guys thank you
