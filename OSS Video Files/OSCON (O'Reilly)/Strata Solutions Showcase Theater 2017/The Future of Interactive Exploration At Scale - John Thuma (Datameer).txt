	                              hi everyone its Jon thumma here from                               data mirror and I'm here to give a                               presentation on a hot new thing that                               we've announced yesterday here at the                               strata conference called Eureka or what                               we call visual exploration but before we                               get into that let's go over our                               capabilities overview first of all we                               have we have a very unique spreadsheet                                interface that is familiar to business                                user you know                                                       built into the box                                                   built in the good thing about this is                                that it's familiar to our business                                analysts and it's familiar to our                                business data users if you're familiar                                with Excel which is the world's largest                                database on the planet and you're going                                to be right at home with data mirror                                right not only with that but we have                                what we call a formula builder and this                                formula builder is it a user guided                                interface for wrangling data and and                                transforming your data and it's a simple                                guided interface that allows you to                                basically your business analyst to be                                able to do whatever they need to do and                                of course we have our flip side which is                                our profiler which profiles all the data                                in your columns in your workbook right                                so this is a very powerful feature for                                looking for outliers and looking for you                                know different data data oddities in                                your in your in your source systems and                                then we have this sheet dependency graph                                and this is really a spider diagram of                                all the different tabs that are in your                                workbook and it shows how they all lit                                the lineage of all the tabs they work                                together to form a result a data set and                                a transformation so and then another                                thing we have is something called smart                                analytics and smart analytics is really                                for different functions we have a                                recommendations engine we have a column                                dependencies which is a correlations we                                have a k-means clustering algorithm and                                and and other things and this comes                                standard out of the box what's great                                about this is that as you drag-and-drop                                different fields into the into the into                                the into the into the window there you                                can actually see your advanced analytics                                capability come to life so what we're                                looking at is the correlation feature                                which is one of the most powerful things                                in the box but what's really interesting                                is our data mere visual Explorer and                                this is really a game changer and you                                can tell I spend a lot of time on these                                slides because I didn't want to really                                over do the slides here so I got a                                generic black and white slide the reason                                is is because the the visual Explorer is                                a pretty amazing product on its own                                big data has big problems and let's face                                it let's be realistic development                                complexity over the last                                               I've worked on very large database                                systems from petabyte systems to                                terabyte systems and I've always had                                some level of a fixed schema I've had to                                be a developer I've had to know what I                                was doing I had its three most expensive                                letters in data warehousing or ETL                                extract transform and load having to                                have a data from a source and mapping it                                into a star schema or a snowflake schema                                is something that is very complicated to                                do and requires very expensive people                                right and then you have slow performance                                right slow performance means that I only                                can answer use cases that I can respond                                to in the time that I get my answer back                                which greatly limits what you can do                                with your data right and then of course                                my business needs are constantly under                                change which means that my schema may                                have to change I mean it may have to do                                different things right to make my to                                make my analytics work again right as my                                business questions change so does my                                schema so we've all talked about                                schema-less infrastructures and so over                                the past twenty five to thirty years                                I've worked on things like Teradata and                                ''tis a sequel server and all kinds of                                things building out snowflakes schemas                                and star schemas and whatnot I've built                                 OLAP cubes with Essbase I've built all                                 these things right MDX queries Microsoft                                 sequel server implementations of OLAP                                 and of course we've built our rolap                                 systems which is just basically building                                 up roll-ups that are rolled up by month                                 or by week or by year or something of                                 that nature we've always had a fixed                                 schema the second that we could not                                 answer those questions we had to go back                                 and redo that schema which means I have                                 to go back and find people like John                                 thumma and other people that know how to                                 develop these solutions and these people                                 are expensive and hard to find right                                 then we got to in-memory systems like                                 spark and and and Hana and things like                                 that well those two have a very rigid                                 schema and can be very expensive and                                 difficult to implement                                 trust me I've worked with startups with                                 a spark back-end they're extremely                                 complicated and hard to use right also                                 you're not just going to turn spice Park                                 over to your business user you're not                                 going to do that right and then GPUs the                                 hottest thing today is GPUs and you know                                 again it's a fixed piece of                                 we're right well what I'm about to show                                 you requires no rigid schema requires                                 none of these five things and that's                                 important okay so let's go ahead and                                 take a look so I'm gonna log in and what                                 you're looking at is data mirror and                                 everything that you're familiar with                                 with data mirror is still available in                                 the box                                                              connectors I can connect to just about                                 anything right and what you're looking                                 at here is our workbook interface so I'm                                 not doing anything special to the data                                 there's no rigid schema I literally                                 could import data into data mirror and                                 go right to visual exploration so let's                                 go ahead and take a look so here's all                                 my all my columns that are associated                                 with my worksheet right I come in here                                 like so and I click visual explore                                 you'll see that all those columns are                                 now listed down below here right and                                 what's neat is that as I start to click                                 in and explore I'm gonna choose my                                 Medicare allowed amount and my Medicare                                 payment amount you're gonna see that the                                 visual automatically associates with                                 that now what's in what's critical here                                 is we're looking at                                                    and we can look at hundreds of millions                                 to billions of records we are doing this                                 all in Hadoop let me repeat that because                                 it's really critical                                                    instantly came up in Hadoop no memory no                                 spark no fixed schema none of that right                                 so now what we're looking at is a                                 scatterplot if I wanted to I could zoom                                 in and this is all                                                      can zoom in on a specific area of this                                 particular scatterplot and I can take a                                 look at the outliers I can take a look                                 at different things but the other neat                                 thing is I can actually start to drill                                 down and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm                                 gonna I'm gonna choose my provider type                                 and here we go so now we've actually                                 we're going to focus in on all those                                    million parts by provider type and as                                 you can see I've got all these other                                 things here right so I'm gonna come in                                 here and I'm going to choose my data                                 service I'm gonna slide this over and                                 we're actually gonna reduce we're gonna                                 put a where clause in there kind of                                 sorta and we're actually gonna have this                                 come back and under four seconds that's                                 pretty incredible I mean this is all on                                 Hadoop no rigid schema                                            records we can go to hundreds of                                 millions and billions of records and we                                 can achieve the same result I think                                 that's pretty incredible                                 but let's go ahead I want to show you                                 another type of visualization we'll come                                 back out                                 like so and we'll choose our pick pick                                 description and I'll give you an                                 indication and here's how fast the data                                 comes back across eighty million records                                 and now I can choose my visualization                                 type we have our stacked bar chart right                                 here right now I want to take a look at                                 the male and female population that is                                 associated with that that that plot so                                 now we're repotting by gender here and I                                 can then if I need to I can drill down                                 and I can explore just on that                                 particular area and I start the whole                                 process over but I'm only looking at                                 that limited scope of data again eighty                                 million records nine nodes of to do this                                 is not a very large cluster it's a                                 standard Hadoop cluster no memory no                                 fixed schema none of that right so we'll                                 go ahead and cancel out of that but                                 let's take a big risk here I'm actually                                 going to slice and dice that records by                                 something of more cardinality here and                                 I'm gonna go into and I'm gonna go into                                 provider type across the across the side                                 so no longer we're going to we're gonna                                 slice and dice by three we're going to                                 slice and dice by hundreds so what we've                                 done here is we've actually slice and                                 dice that data across                                                    across a variety of different of                                 provider types across the bottom here so                                 that's the power of Eureka then when I'm                                 ready and I found what I need I can then                                 take this back to my workbook by                                 clicking create sheet and what we're                                 doing now is we're gonna create a new                                 sheet we're going to take our data back                                 and we're gonna now were able to use the                                 familiar data mirror experience to                                 wrangle this data to connect this data                                 to join this data to other sources and                                 finish and complete my my analytic use                                 case to me this is amazing right this is                                 this is a pretty amazing thing because                                 what this allows me to do is continue my                                 journey okay                                 with that set what I can do is I can now                                 the other things I can do is I can sort                                 and I can group off of these things and                                 what I love about data mirror is that I                                 have a zero code interface right                                 everything is drag-and-drop everything                                 is point-and-click and I can actually                                 select different attributes and do                                 sorting I can do you know different                                 different kinds of things and that the                                 other thing that I like is I can start                                 to build k-means clusters and I can                                 start dragging and dropping objects                                 inside of this k-means cluster like so                                 and my cluster will start to form right                                 in front of my eyes right and this is                                 pretty amazing we're actually going to                                 generate a three there's three centroids                                 of clusters of data and it gives me                                 another feature and functionality that I                                 can use and this is our advanced our                                 smart analytics functionality that                                 allows it to do that so of course anyway                                 so I'd like to say thank you very much                                 for this and it's been great
