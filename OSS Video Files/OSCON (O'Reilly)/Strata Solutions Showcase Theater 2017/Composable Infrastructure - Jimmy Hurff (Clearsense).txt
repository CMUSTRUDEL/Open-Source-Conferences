	                              my name is Jimmy Herff and I'm with                               clear sense                               so just a quick a little bit about me I                               introduced myself generally as a                               computer nerd so I'm from Jacksonville                               Florida live in st. Augustine and got a                               background in software development Java                               Enterprise Architecture big data is                               something that I've started working on                                in the last three or four years but I                                kind of balance in between the                                development operation space like DevOps                                so purpose of this slide is just to kind                                of give you a quick                                                     on clear sense so clear sense is a                                healthcare IT company we basically build                                analytic solutions for healthcare our                                target target customer would be                                hospitals and health systems and clear                                sense is really a a predictions company                                so we have a couple of clinical use                                cases in play using streaming data to                                try to predict patient deterioration you                                can see the the bullets here I mean it's                                at we're at where software as-a-service                                cloud-based solution I'm going to spend                                most of the time talking a little bit                                about that and if the infrastructure                                move that we did basically going from                                the public cloud to the private cloud                                but I didn't want to kind of fall on the                                sword right out of the gate here a                                little bit and say you know public cloud                                is awesome I'm a big public cloud I'm a                                cloud guy in general                                love-love the vendors in the space so                                this isn't to beat up on any of them but                                I do want to talk about specifically                                drive scale and some total cost of                                ownership decisions that we made to try                                to go from public cloud to stuff                                on-premises for ours and we found drive                                scale to to be a very cost effective                                solution kind of part of that solution                                so I'm going to kind of avoid the                                dramatic reveal here and say this is                                going to be a little bit about the drive                                scale solution so again clear sense just                                to kind of orient you kind of up there                                at the top you know you've got the                                hospitals hospitals and health systems                                could be conglomerates of many hospitals                                they have point-of-care facilities out                                there but that's our that's our client                                our client is the hospital out there in                                the providing care to the citizens in                                the United States and then we create                                connectivity into their into their                                environments and ingest data into our                                cloud-based platform so clear sense is a                                start-up we've got about three years                                under our belt and in                                     we went out and kind of made our first                                cloud procurement and when we did that                                we started spending money month over                                month you know with you know compute                                cycles and memory and storage and in                                about mid                                                             expansion and in that cloud expansion we                                saw our cost go up a multiple several                                several times we went from spending                                around $                                                               $                                                                     it was it was a shock for us we were we                                we knew that we were going to have to go                                probably from public to on print at some                                point but it happened a lot sooner than                                we were anticipating and so we it                                basically caused us to have to take a                                step back and evaluate our cloud                                strategy and go like as we kind of                                compare our current position and spend                                along with what our expected customer                                acquisition rate is we saw our cloud                                cross growing significantly and we                                wanted to make sure that we were kind of                                prepared for that so basically that                                little red flashing thing there my                                graphic artist people tell me that                                that's too dry to draw attention to the                                fact that holy cow something happened                                right then that we really wanted to pay                                attention to and so we kind of we're                                very methodical in our approach we                                reviewed where we were and said you know                                is this just the cost of doing business                                or could we could we look at different                                options that might make it more                                economically if you know affordable for                                 us and cost-effective and so we kind of                                 came up with three sort of macro options                                 and I'm going to kind of go into them                                 I'm gonna spend most of the time going                                 into option                                                           one that we chose so I'm kind of telling                                 you in advance to pay close attention to                                 that but basically option                                             stay in the public cloud not not deviate                                 from it kind of stay with our vendor and                                 and maybe look at all altering the sorts                                 of instance types that we're using or                                 the services but staying with the same                                 vendor that was sort of option                                           will and option                                                          vendors entirely go to a different                                 public cloud vendor and move our                                 services from one or the other and we                                 were looking at it really from the                                 economic standpoint option                                              to Red Hat you go to Dell you say I want                                 to stand up a data Lake and they roll                                 out what they call kind of their                                 reference implementation here's here's                                 the book to go stand up a data Lake you                                 know Hadoop data Lake can start to build                                 you know                                 clothes on your own proper on your own                                 assets and so I really want to kind of                                 point out this this is you know this                                 option to an option                                                      the two that we really evaluated cuz                                 well we really thought there was a                                 better way to get more bang for our buck                                 in terms of our spin from an                                 infrastructure standpoint and and what                                 I'm trying to call out in this picture                                 here is that the idea is you scale out                                 by adding a whole host you add a whole                                 new host and then that host it has CPU                                 and memory and storage internal into                                 that device and you're sort of rigidly                                 fixed in the ratio between your CPU                                 cores and your memory gigs and your                                 storage gigs so the point is is that if                                 you're going to scale out you have to                                 add a whole nother a whole nother device                                 or a whole nother group of devices and                                 where we felt like that just kind of                                 looking at it more from like a Theory of                                 Constraints standpoint you're gonna be                                 you know one of those three dimensions                                 is probably going to be your limiting                                 dimension and which one is that is that                                 CPU is that memory is that storage and                                 the truth was that we didn't really know                                 our workloads were we're not as you know                                 not as mature as some and so we weren't                                 certain if we were going to be CPU bound                                 or memory bound or storage bound so                                 option                                                                  you know really was around the drive                                 scale kind of the drive scale strategy                                 and again I wanted there's a flair for                                 the dramatic here check this out this is                                 the drive scale piece drive scale comes                                 in and sets is this it's it's an it's an                                 interface that sits in between your                                 storage and your computer and so I want                                 to take a moment just kind of talk                                 through some of the the key points here                                 so in the previous slide we were looking                                 at I'll just tell you we were looking at                                 Dell equipment were pretty much all Dell                                 so we were running Dell our                                              option                                                                which are a smaller form factor device                                 but the main difference is they don't                                 have the internal storage we went ended                                 up going option three it didn't have the                                 internal storage it actually is attached                                 using the device there in the middle of                                 the drive scale adapter that drysdale                                 adapter sits in between our                                          nodes the compute memory nodes to what                                 we have J baud chassis just a bunch of                                 disks a C's that have in terms that have                                 disks mounted within them and the drive                                 scale adapters sit in between those                                 devices and basically do the the iya                                 in between the the storage and the RAM                                 in the CPU what what is you know kind of                                 the reason why we chose this is this                                 composable composable software                                 infrastructure sort of idea and what it                                 gives us the opportunity to do is if we                                 find ourselves to be CPU bound we can                                 add more six                                                          and add additional storage or if we find                                 ourselves to be storage limited we can                                 go and buy more storage independently of                                 CPU and memory and again we found that                                 gave us the most cost-effective and sort                                 of flexible strategy around our storage                                 disaggregation sort of approach here so                                 again we did choose this one and it was                                 really around this this idea of giving                                 us flexibility for being able to choose                                 and and cost-effectiveness was really                                 the driver there all right so I wanted                                 you know we talked about it you know                                 what drove it and then you know what                                 were we successful right yeah what                                 happened afterwards so we we saw that we                                 were able to buy a lot more computing                                 capacity with with the same dollars in                                 fact we got to a place where we were had                                                                                                       about                                                                   times more storage with the drive scale                                 solution than what we had in in our                                 cloud public cloud offering and the                                 reason why that's interesting to me as                                 the technology officer clear sense is                                 that you know we we fixed kind of fixed                                 our spin for a little while and for a                                 startup that's trying to you know try to                                 be we have to be good stewards of what                                 we have you can see here the before and                                 after we were spinning or approximately                                 forty thousand dollars a month on our on                                 our cloud-based big data strategy and                                 afterwards that dropped to eleven                                 thousand dollars a month spend amateur                                 eyes out over a four-year kind of                                 time-life lifespan for equipment but in                                 its on top of that we had significantly                                 more resources our to available to us                                 the performance our latency was a lot                                 better we have more capacity I mean                                 everything was was was better after the                                 move because we had more resources aleck                                 to use more and more demand ability                                 you know and I certainly have covered a                                 lot of ground here be glad to talk in                                 more detail if you guys are interested                                 we're gonna be over at the at the drive                                 scale booth but I wanted to hit home on                                 one like kind of really important point                                 to me you know chief technology officer                                 that roll at the end of the day I'm                                 looking at the the CEO and the CFO and                                 and the the business leaders of our                                 organization and they're asking me                                 whether or not we're going to be able to                                 do well I have to deliver on the on the                                 the strategy for the company and what I                                 found in drive scale was I cannot give                                 these folks the highest marks in terms                                 of their their partnership in terms of                                 their willingness to come in and partner                                 with us to come in early and to stay                                 late and to help us get it done no                                 matter what you know as somebody who's                                 you know responsible for getting it done                                 that was probably the most refreshing                                 thing about working with drive scales                                 their technology is fantastic I don't                                 want to I don't want to talk bad about                                 their technology but they're people                                 really delivered on what their promises                                 were and so I just want to make sure                                 that that I get that across drive scale                                 is a great company to work with so with                                 that I think we're done and if you'd                                 like to talk more we'll be over at
