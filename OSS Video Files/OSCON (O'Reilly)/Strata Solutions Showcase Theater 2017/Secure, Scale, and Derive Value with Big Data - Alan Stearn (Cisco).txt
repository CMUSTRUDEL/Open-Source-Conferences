	                              all right let's get to it normally I'm                               in the position of being between you and                               your favorite adult beverage fortunately                               today I don't have that problem so my                               name is Alan Stern I'm a technical                               solutions architect at Cisco but the                               guys that really deserve the credit for                               this presentation are Pioche and jag                               they're the folks in our IT group that                                worked tirelessly to make sure our stuff                                works and it is a thankless job so I                                want to go ahead and thank them for all                                the hard work they do                                so as you might imagine we have a lot of                                IT endpoints and a lot of devices in                                Cisco we are roughly                                                   across ninety seven countries two                                hundred twenty nine point four megawatts                                that's that's probably a small town the                                number that surprised me was two hundred                                and three thousand connected devices and                                I'm gonna tell you that seemed a little                                low if you think about it                                                                                                      endpoints per employee many of us have                                many more than four so a lot of                                stakeholders so there was a lot riding                                on this project on how do we do this                                data transformation and move into a                                single environment like everybody else                                we ran into one big problem we had data                                silos and unfortunately businesses don't                                operate and data silos they operate as                                an enterprise so we wanted to get to                                this single unified enterprise data                                platform that would really give all the                                different business functions the ability                                to query the data across the different                                silos and we'll talk a little bit about                                why that is and how we do it so if you                                think about it this is a great example                                with product development sales marketing                                supply chain service delivery ops and HR                                the salespeople are always beating on                                the product development we need more                                features we need this feature we need                                that feature and we need it yesterday                                but the product development folks like                                my friend Hahn are saying well what are                                you going to be able to sell if I give                                you this feature what can you give me                                so there's not a single direction data                                flow it's I want metrics about what                                you're going to give me and then once                                you I give it to you I want to know that                                you can sell it and then of course the                                supply chain people definitely want to                                know what's coming from the sales                                forecast and salespeople are generally                                not great at forecasting they tend to                                sandbag when it's in their best interest                                so they still have to know because we've                                got to build a product and of course the                                salespeople get upset if you don't have                                the product when it's the customers want                                it and then on the service delivery side                                it's really important for failure                                analysis we don't want a single                                component failure to start affecting the                                entire product we want to understand why                                products failed the most obvious answer                                isn't always the one that's the real                                answer and of course ops HR and Finance                                security there is the overarching theme                                we've seen the damage in recent weeks of                                what can happen when there's a security                                breach and it's critical that we protect                                not only our internal data because                                that's our intellectual property that's                                what makes Cisco I believe to be a great                                company but it's also got our customer                                data and we have to be good stewards of                                their important data so there's a lot                                riding on this project so the actual                                diagram of how you know what it looks                                like now is less important than what we                                learned and the big takeaway as always                                and this it shouldn't surprise anyone is                                the architecture matters spend the time                                upfront planning what things will look                                like plan for what things will look like                                in the future because how things are                                today is not what it'll look like in the                                future a single security                                methodology isn't going to protect you                                the criminals and the folks that want to                                do us harm are not going to go knocking                                on your front door they're gonna come at                                you on your front door if it's unlocked                                 they're gonna open it if that doesn't                                 work they're gonna come around and try                                 to climb the fence in the in the                                 backyard so you've got to have                                 multi-layered security in order to                                 protect your environment                                 the other thing that's not soon be                                 surprising is invest in skills and                                 choose the right components the folks                                 that do this type of work are in short                                 supply so it's critical to find the                                 right people but you already have the                                 right people in many cases so why not                                 invest in them and improve their skills                                 give them the skills they need to stay                                 with you and take you on this journey                                 that's a much easier path and going out                                 and trying to find mercenaries that can                                 help you on this path and choose the                                 right components for what you're trying                                 to do that there is no best component                                 for any particular task there is a best                                 component for your environment so that's                                 also critical so as you might imagine we                                 we have a platform for this task and boy                                 I wish I remembered the close spark when                                 my machine booted at Cisco we don't eat                                 our own dog food and that may surprise                                 you we much prefer to drink our own                                 champagne champagne to me tastes a lot                                 better than dog food I've never tried                                 dog food I have no intention of doing it                                 so we rely on our Cisco platform                                 architecture                                 these are architectures that we've                                 developed through our business unit                                 where they go out and they will test the                                 components ensure they work together and                                 ultimately behind that they'll drive a                                 Cisco validated design and that                                 validated design is about                                              detail on how to deploy a particular                                 solution so we are using our own                                 research our own development and that's                                 really critical and this is what it                                 looks like so this is just one small                                 component of it we're going with a spine                                 leaf architecture this is a modern data                                 center network backbone so in this                                 particular example you see two spine                                 switches and then these are the leaf                                 switches here and then at the top of                                 each rack we have the Cisco fabric                                 interconnects and if you're not familiar                                 with what a fabric interconnect is I                                 would encourage you to come see us in                                 the Cisco booth we'd be happy to explain                                 to you what it does but that's the                                 brains behind what cisco ucs is all                                 about what really makes us different                                 than the other server vendor                                 in the environment now this type of                                 architecture allows us to scale to tens                                 of thousands of nodes so we can really                                 scale this to whatever we're going to                                 need now and in the future UCS service                                 profiles are the magic as I said and                                 service profiles allow you to configure                                 once and let the experts in your                                 environment configure the network                                 configure the servers and so on all the                                 way through the environment and then you                                 aggregate that and when you go to deploy                                 a server you click a button and you know                                 that that                                                          deploying is deployed the same way that                                 first server was so that there's never a                                 problem with configuration management                                 from that perspective people are really                                 bad at following instructions you know                                 click here do this that this at that it                                 doesn't work well with Cisco we automate                                 that inherently that's native to our                                 platform that's what we do so you take                                 that and the results for us we're not                                 surprising to us VLANs as you might                                 imagine Cisco's pretty good at VLANs you                                 saw that we took that time down from                                                                                                      down to almost zero and all of these                                 things rope to zero the critical one to                                 me is firmware upgrades when I was in IT                                 we just didn't do them because it was                                 too hard with with the idea of a service                                 profile I update the service profile and                                 then I can do rolling upgrades through                                 my entire environment at a time of my                                 choosing in order to ensure that I can                                 move to the next version of software                                 code or just stay in a supported fashion                                 and I'm having to go really fast because                                 a complex project being delivered in                                    minutes is not an easy thing so bear                                 with me as I talk a little bit faster so                                 this is more accurately defining what                                 the environment looks like at the spine                                 level there's                                                           out the leaves and we can still get                                 tremendous bandwidth so we're now able                                 to we're leveraging                                                      so whatever the future brings us in                                 terms of data will be able to                                 accommodate it                                 so what did we learn well the one thing                                 we learned is part of this spine and                                 leap is we used our own Cisco ACI and                                 this is our Sdn fabric and it gives us                                 some really interesting things that we                                 could do there that we couldn't normally                                 do so from a performance perspective we                                 we saw this jump in the data processing                                 on each job                                 we went from                                                       in doing this allows us to define which                                 endpoints can talk to which end points                                 so we're radically simplifying that and                                 we see this here we reduced from                                        CLS down to                                                             decrease and I'm gonna go ahead and                                 build out the next level and build what                                 we know is the more you can reduce                                 complexity the more likely you are to                                 have a secure environment                                 complexity is the the evil people's                                 friend simplicity is your friend in                                 terms of securing your environment an                                 ACI allows you to do that we eliminated                                 hundreds of hours of planning and set-up                                 time for the ACLs as we go to scale the                                 environment it's rinse and repeat we're                                 not having to go back to the network and                                 say hey I need to add another server I                                 need to add another spine switch I need                                 to add another leaf switch we can just                                 plug them in and because of the way this                                 is automated it allows us to get away                                 from the configuration management                                 process how many have ever gone to a                                 change management meeting how much fun                                 are they it's it's like having root                                 canal because you've got to justify why                                 you're making the change when you're                                 going to make the change how you're                                 going to make the change and what's your                                 backup procedure is so the more you can                                 avoid that the better off you are and                                 the faster your environment can move so                                 I'm running out of time the key here is                                 we give you that ability to make those                                 changes quickly in an automated fashion                                 and most importantly we let you do it                                 securely and that's exactly what we did                                 in our environment so thank you all very                                 much for your time                                 and have a great rest
