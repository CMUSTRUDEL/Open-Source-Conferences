	                              so I'm Sean Coghlan with cloudian and I                               was asked to come and address the                               audience today in regards to five ways                               that object storage can help machine                               learning so I'm gonna kind of run                               through a few ways and then kind of talk                               a little bit more about each one of                               these but first and foremost objects                               storage and cloudian provides a single                                global namespace and a peer-to-peer                                network that's globally distributed we                                also provide an extremely low cost                                platform                                typically I tell customers that if                                you're going to look at a data set your                                machine learning algorithms are only                                going to be as good as the amount of                                data that you actually store against                                those algorithms right so the lower the                                cost the storage the more that you'll be                                able to analyze right and and that's                                kind of what we help in a big way and                                I'll talk more about that also we                                provide an on-premises private cloud                                storage right so I tell customers if                                your data is originating inside your                                premise well then you need a storage                                system that captures that locally and                                then might be able to distribute or tear                                the data out to the cloud if you need to                                kind of spin up you know lots of CPU in                                the cloud and that's kind of what                                cloudian provides is this hybrid                                approach to storing data and today we                                just announced with Microsoft Azure                                we're the first object storage system                                that natively supports the s                                          can tear directly to asher and and the                                azure stack in the cloud that goes along                                with our for the last year or two we've                                been tearing data to AWS s                                            well as to the Google cloud what's uh                                what I actually talk a lot and and work                                with a lot of banks as well as federal                                government agencies and part of the                                the mandate by a lot of infrastructure                                teams is around security of data storage                                and and cloudian and our Stan she ation                                of objects storage allows for deep                                integration with AES                                                   as well as integration with access                                controls including LDAP and Active                                Directory so we give you kind of the                                ability to control and and make sure                                that your data is safe all the time and                                especially it's inside your firewall not                                in the public cloud so there's a lot                                more data control and lastly the s                                     support so our API is the s                                        we're the only object storage venture                                object storage vendor that natively                                supports the s                                                          verbs so you don't have to change your                                application that you may have built to                                model out in the public cloud you can                                bring that in-house and be able to                                utilize all the tools and all the                                aspects of the verbs that you would get                                in the public cloud but you could do                                that through the API API on on your                                premise so just talking through what is                                object storage for those that don't know                                very simply we take through the API a                                URL address right it's a web service API                                and we hashed that API and that                                essentially is the naming convention                                right with a bucket name and an object                                name at the application level of where                                the data is going to be stored on disk                                and so we hashed that and we distribute                                that in a Cassandra NoSQL database so                                that we understand securely across a                                cluster potentially geographically                                dispersed where that data is all that                                all the time so it can be retrieved back                                to the application right so as opposed                                to traditional storage where it's nass                                or sips NFS or block storage where the                                applications either see a filesystem a                                directory structure or a block protocol                                in this case the applications are are                                utilizing a web service                                API right it's a URL address so we have                                a policy based system so again we can                                distribute the data globally and you set                                the policies for how you go and do this                                so we can do things in a single site                                just kind of like Amazon has kind of                                like a single availability zone we can                                 have a single site in your data center                                 we can have multiple sites we can                                 distribute erasure codes across multiple                                 sites and you set these levels of policy                                 on a bucket to bucket basis right you                                 can also determine and set policy on                                 your consistency level so lots of                                 flexibility within the system from a                                 cost perspective you know again I said                                 before you know if you want to be able                                 to take costs out of the equation and                                 store as much data as you possibly can                                 then we're the best answer for that we                                 were able to store this is a ten                                 petabyte example but we could store                                    petabytes of data with a five year cost                                 of                                                                    over that                                                            know about                                                           less than glaciar but our response time                                 is measured in milliseconds not in hours                                 right we're actually                                                  and you could say oh but now I have to                                 store the data I have to manage that                                 infrastructure and there's networking                                 cost and that's all true but that's not                                                                                                          of dollars worth right so this is the                                 TCO is about one you know one thirtieth                                 the cost when you include that there's                                 no bandwidth costs with what we do here                                 as well I talked about the the s                                      again not everybody's object store is is                                 truly compatible with the s                                           might do some gets puts post deletes and                                 basic things but with cloudy and you get                                 all the verbs that are available within                                 the API and you don't have to change                                 your application to have it work on                                 premise again we're a distributed                                 cluster that's geographically to where                                 so when when the data comes or a request                                 for the data comes into the system                                 you're never more than one hop away                                 right so latency in our architecture or                                 response time to the application                                 you know parallels nothing right so                                 we're definitely extremely performant at                                 least for an architecture that can scale                                 the hundreds of petabytes and billions                                 and billions of objects we also provide                                 encryption so again in where I talked                                 about security as being really important                                 encryption both at the client side as                                 well as at at the server side kind of                                 where we do this so we're able to                                 encrypt data both in flight and at rest                                 and very important it allows you to                                 manage the keys yourself so you can                                 manage the keys in-house and still be                                 able to tear the data out to the public                                 cloud right so you want to make sure                                 that you don't send data out to the                                 cloud that isn't pre encrypted right so                                 we provide our customers the ability of                                 controlling the encryption keys inside                                 your firewall not outside this is kind                                 of our framework so I talked a lot about                                 kind of the storage piece but really at                                 the end of the day cloudian allows you                                 to create this data management platform                                 and that mataman management platform                                 through the s                                                          to all other types of applications right                                 including up to spark right if you're                                 doing kind of in-memory analytics if                                 you're doing things like elastic search                                 or you're doing log aggregation if we                                 work with sky mind who's signing some                                 books over here they're utilizing us                                 natively for our s                                                     API to their application as well but                                 this is kind of just a logical                                 architecture of how we can take the                                 baseline of a private s                                                  API and extend that to all                                 different types of applications this is                                 an example of how we extend our                                 Cassandra database into elastic search                                 so again any of the data that's stored                                 in us including the metadata is all                                 extensible directly from us into elastic                                 search and you're able to essentially                                 scrape scrape the data that's stored                                 within us and it allow it's a really                                 powerful aspect being able to index and                                 search all of the data in a single                                 platform that sits inside your firewall                                 it's just a little bit more on on the                                 company where we're kind of a late-stage                                 kind of startup at this point but still                                 continue to grow really fast obviously I                                 just talked about our partnership with                                 Microsoft today but you'll see a lot                                 more you know from us in terms of larger                                 partnerships as well lastly this is kind                                 of the summary of what we do and the                                 takeaways that I want from you is really                                 that this is an on-premises private                                 cloud s                                                                 features and functionality of the public                                 cloud but on-premise at a fraction of                                 the cost                                 thank you very much and appreciate the                                 strata for hosting us today
