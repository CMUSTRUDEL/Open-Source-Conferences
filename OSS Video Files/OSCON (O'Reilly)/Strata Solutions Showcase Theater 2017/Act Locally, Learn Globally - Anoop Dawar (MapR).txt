	                              welcome everyone I want to talk to you                               about act local locally learn globally                               it's a phrase we use internally a lot to                               combine IOT and data words into a single                               world                               my name is a noob tower and an product                               management and product marketing at map                               our technologies let's start with just a                               quick overview of what map are does so                                mapper has built a platform for all data                                across every cloud and it allows you to                                essentially ingest store manage analyze                                process and then apply the insights from                                the data in real time to your business                                processes and the way we do it is we                                want to allow the embracing of the                                existing in legacy applications with new                                generation applications whether they are                                pure analytical applications or even                                real time operational applications so                                let's talk about iot a little bit right                                in the Internet of Things is all things                                to all people there are a lot of ways                                people think about it but if you look at                                all the way from the chips that are in                                the sensors to the edge devices to then                                the day how the data streams from these                                systems into the network and back to the                                cloud it's actually a whole data fabric                                it's a massive billions of billions of                                events billions of devices data fabric                                and in order to be able to harness the                                energy of the data fabric and take                                actions you need to be able to learn                                from everywhere                                learn from every edge device every IOT                                system and then act anywhere at any time                                so you need to be able to then have that                                global knowledge and then be able to                                quickly spread that Google global                                knowledge to the edge devices so that                                the edge devices can then make take                                local actions even in cases where it's                                unable to connect to the mothership so                                you're in systems and locations which                                are occasionally connected and                                occasionally disconnected so let's take                                an example I think we've all seen how                                connected that cars and autonomous car                                revolution is going to take take take                                big strides in the next few years                                but if you then look at the amount of                                data these things systems generate                                it's completely mind-boggling so for                                example in pre-production our car                                generates                                                             imagine how much data that is right and                                so if you then try to expand it even if                                you compress it you will get literally a                                petabyte of data from every car every                                year how do you deal with that                                complexity when you look at these use                                cases that people want to power with the                                autonomous systems you will see sis use                                cases that are very advanced driver                                assistance use cases like helping with                                lane change traffic sign recognition                                pedestrian recognition entity                                recognition - computer-aided driving the                                ability to detect traffic jams and road                                conditions and weather conditions - just                                basic vehicle maintenance and healthcare                                and then finally radically understand                                and figure out how to build your                                insurance models and the economic models                                for these autonomous systems work so                                I'll give you an example of a customer                                of my part that's actually trying to do                                pre-production autonomous vehicles and                                looking to how to bring it into into                                production so here is a classical                                pre-production connected vehicle                                thousands of tests are running on a                                sample of pre-production cars                                           day because they have a few                                pre-production pilots each                                pre-production pilot costs a lot of                                money they run these cars in three                                shifts of                                                               shift the day the car docks in the disk                                drives are removed from the car and new                                disk drives are put in the car and then                                it goes for another eight-hour shift so                                you're literally gaining now                                                                                                                                                                                     the into the map our system but usually                                it takes you then                                                     into a code encode data center where you                                 can then analyze every signal that                                 happened every event that happened and                                 then figure out what you can do to your                                 software and your machine learning                                 models to improve your next run of that                                 autonomous vehicle or a connected car                                 which is simply too long                                 so what what what they did is they                                 brought an edge system inside mapper                                 inside the car which is sitting in a                                 trunk                                 imagine for those of you who remember                                 the days of six CD players that were in                                 the trunk of your car                                 think about that form factor of an                                 intelligent device that's sitting in the                                 trunk of your car and can you know                                 basically consumed terabytes and                                 terabytes of data but also have a                                 machine learning model in there that can                                 be tweaked for the real-time conditions                                 and act immediately and that shrinks the                                 time to insight fairly quickly and you                                 can then iterate over the conditions of                                 your environment and the more iterations                                 you can do and the faster iterations you                                 can do based on the environment the                                 quicker your system is going to become                                 more autonomous and learn better so this                                 is sort of the architecture or the                                 framework or how this system gets built                                 it has these systems at the edge the                                 edge could be any edge it could be an                                 autonomous vehicle it could be a                                 hospital it could be an oil rig where                                 you do have a point of presence a                                 complete system that stores reliably as                                 a full analytical stack and a fully                                 operational stack so that it can do                                 machine learning and then have machine                                 learning models that are changing on the                                 fly and act while also simultaneously                                 sending only the relevant information to                                 your central data centers so that the                                 central data centers can still continue                                 to learn globally so you have a point of                                 presence on your edge could be millions                                 of devices or billions of devices and                                 then you have a point of presence in                                 your core data center or your public                                 cloud where you're learning globally                                 this is what we call the act locally                                 learn globally architecture to summarize                                 we call it the ability to leverage local                                 data from numerous sources for                                 constructing ml and deep serve deep                                 learning models with global knowledge                                 and then these models can be rapidly                                 deployed at the edge to enable real-time                                 decision-making so there is a streaming                                 framework that's built into the system                                 that allows fie allows you to push                                 machine learning models either from the                                 cloud to the edge or from the edge to                                 the                                 cloud so you can deploy them in real                                 time let's look at a couple of more                                 examples but before I go into that I                                 wanted to show you how small this                                    deployment could be so for those of you                                 who are familiar with Intel nook                                 machines and if you haven't seen one you                                 go to our booth on aisle                                                see three Intel nukes that are running                                 most of our demos there are about five                                 demos in the booth that are running on                                 Intel look machines and these are really                                 small form-factor machines that can be                                 placed in any location and can give you                                 a full complete data stack so let's look                                 at another example so this is an example                                 of an oil company that has thousands of                                 oil and gas sources and the interesting                                 thing we found out is whenever they do                                 they would have a contractor that was                                 going to the oil rig to service any                                 equipment they would send a laptop with                                 that contractor then the contractor will                                 take that laptop plug it to various                                 devices download the information that                                 they needed and then bring it back to a                                 place where they could then connect it                                 to their global data center and then                                 that's how they were getting all the                                 information of all their oil rigs which                                 takes as you can imagine a lot of time                                 and effort and cost once the data is in                                 inside their data center then they can                                 analyze and figure out and do analytics                                 on it                                 so again by simply installing an edge on                                 the oil rig they were able to sort of                                 consolidate all that data into a single                                 system and then whenever there is                                 connectivity let's say a contractor                                 comes in with a Wi-Fi signal or a                                    signal the edge device just connects to                                 the network and ships the data as                                 required compressed secure and only the                                 data that you require to be shipped and                                 not all the data and you can basically                                 again reduce the time to insight from                                 powers from a couple of days to about                                 two hours another example is a medical                                 device company so this is again and                                 another interesting way to look at how                                 IOT can change the world if you imagine                                 even simple things like MRI scans any of                                 you who've ever been to get an MRI scan                                 or has had a family member or relative                                 get an MRI scan                                 you know that after the scan it takes a                                 while before the results come to you and                                 the reason is the systems have to do                                 very complex image processing and                                 algorithms to figure out and give you a                                 report and those things typically take                                 time but the interesting insight is that                                 the data that's generated from the scan                                 is fairly small it's not that huge so if                                 I can take that data across all the                                 machines in a hospital and immediately                                 let's say ship it to a cloud where I                                 have infinite computer resources I can                                 quickly do the MRI scan in a matter of                                 minutes instead of taking hours or days                                 so while the patient is sitting in the                                 hospital after finishing their scan the                                 scan is is being analyzed in the cloud                                 immediately the results again are fairly                                 small they can get pushed back to the                                 edge and you can have a conversation                                 with your doctor within minutes of                                 having an MRI scan and it just shrinks                                 the amount of pain that all of us as                                 patients go through with these kinds of                                 situations so in just to briefly                                 summarize what this system does is that                                 you can now enable a way to reduce                                 bandwidth requirements from the edge to                                 the cloud because if you try to ship all                                 the data from all the edge to the cloud                                 it's going to be nearly impossible to do                                 because the amount of data on the edge                                 systems is going to be                                                  data in the world or maybe even more and                                 we just simply as a nation or world                                 don't have that kind of a capacity so                                 you need to be able to shrink that data                                 maintain data privacy do the analysis                                 anonymization authentication and the                                 compression and security encryption                                 before you ship the data comply with all                                 the standards bring it back if required                                 and also deal with the sometimes                                 connected sometimes disconnected world                                 with IOT machines because IOT is it's                                 not like just a phone in your pockets                                 which is almost always connected it                                 could be a remote oil it could be a                                 hospital in a remote location it could                                 be an autonomous vehicle that just                                 happens to get crashed and has a has its                                 communication system broken down and it                                 needs to be able to address everything                                 globally because if I want to act low                                 from Global Knowledge the global system                                 needs to be able to find you and push                                 that information and knowledge to you                                 and vice versa the local system needs to                                 know how to talk to the global system                                 and so what you get is you basically get                                 a small platform in a box which gives                                 you full analytics with spar with                                 machine learning with sequel                                 capabilities with a database but also a                                 reliable storage engine that can store                                 with reliability enterprise grade                                 reliability the data you have and then                                 ship it on demand or in real-time to                                 your global system that's the talk for                                 me for today if you have any more                                 questions I'm happy to wait and you can                                 also check out our booth which has five                                 demos including one of the racing car                                 demo that showcases this technology on                                 an Intel look thank you very much
