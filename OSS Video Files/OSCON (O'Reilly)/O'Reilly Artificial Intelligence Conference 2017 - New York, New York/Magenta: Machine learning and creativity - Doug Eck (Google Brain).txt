Title: Magenta: Machine learning and creativity - Doug Eck (Google Brain)
Publication date: 2017-06-30
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Doug Eck offers an overview of Magenta, a Google Brain project to develop new generative machine learning models for art and sound creation, allowing us to better understand how machine learning can be used by artists and musicians to make something new. Doug provides demos and explains where this work fits in with other AI research being done at Google and elsewhere.

	00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:09,469
so I'd like to listen to some of the the

00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:12,530
samples coming from this model these are

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:17,090
trained on lots of piano performances

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:18,650
with velocity and timing and I think

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,539
that compared to the quality at least

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,759
we've been able to get on magenta with

00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,529
with musical scores that aren't

00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,359
performed we can actually train these

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,279
models much better and get a lot more

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,630
out of them and we're in the midst of

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,880
analyzing why we think that's happening

00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,060
but give these a listen let's let's dive

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,060
in

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,970
you

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,510
so that piece was unconditionally

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,070
sampled from the model meaning just one

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,570
note was set in and that was allowed to

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,580
move in some direction that made sense

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,770
certainly there's some musical arc there

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,740
here's another sample that first model

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,330
the first sample I played actually was

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,479
done by an earlier version of the model

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,600
that didn't pay attention to velocity

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,700
pays attention to time that is to say it

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,770
can it can advance time at the

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,210
millisecond level and if you're you can

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,070
kind of hear it it doesn't quite get the

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,990
tempo right but the velocities are all

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,729
fixed now I'm hoping that you'll be able

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,290
to hear it with the sound when I play

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,020
the next sample but you should also hear

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,970
a kind of movement in terms of when

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,250
things get louder and softer and it

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,930
allows it's my ear at least the planning

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,369
to sound more delicate because that sort

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,149
of is an indicator of what it would be

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,149
to play delicately

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:39,370
we'll let one more play

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:44,090
[Music]

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,129
okay so you're thinking great game over

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,420
it's done let's move on we finished with

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,609
music and that we can move on to

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,769
something else like video actually no

00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,849
there's a serious serious limitations to

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:55,159
what we can do with the recurrent neural

00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,109
network like this I put up two of the

00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,790
piano rolls from what you just heard on

00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:00,920
the top notice by the way that

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,989
occasionally the model forgets to turn

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,909
on a note off so the notes just stay on

00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,200
those are those horizontal lines and on

00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,450
the bottom is the Chopin etudes we

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,010
listen to to start with and I think even

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,689
with your eyes you can see all of the

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,189
rich structure the repetition and the

00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:14,840
patterning that's happening in a long

00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:17,120
composition and we're nowhere near

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,889
capturing that so this what we're moving

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,810
is towards trying to understand how we

00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,370
can also pay attention to these these

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,750
longer arcs of meaning that are

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,230
everywhere they're in music they're in

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,760
there in literature they're in art and

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,709
they're very very very hard to capture

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,389
with with listed with deep learning so

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:34,389
we still have a lot of work to do

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,200
