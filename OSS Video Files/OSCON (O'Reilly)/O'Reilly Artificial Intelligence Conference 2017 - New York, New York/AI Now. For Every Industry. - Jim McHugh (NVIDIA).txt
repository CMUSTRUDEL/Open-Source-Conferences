Publication date: 2017-06-28
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	AI has the power to transform critical business processes, but new methods will be essential to analyze and visualize dataâ€”not as a one-time event but as a continuous process. As a result, a new computing paradigm and deep learning software stack will also be required to power, predict, and act on data to accelerate this transition and produce AI enterprise applications.

	00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,000
good morning everyone it's great to be

00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:10,349
back at over le AI so let's just jump in

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,299
I only have ten minutes so I want to get

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,129
the most of it the picture I'm showing

00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:15,419
you now is a picture that we usually a

00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,860
slide that we usually show people more

00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:19,710
either training on deep learning or what

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,269
Ben calls the new new oil or when we ask

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,650
people how they're going to explain it

00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,539
to the people in their organizations

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,550
that understand it and what I like about

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,380
it it actually portrays something that

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,259
is really quite simple to understand we

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,850
take a model we put inputs into it we go

00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,140
through some serious complicated

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,690
calculations and then we create an

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,730
output model a trained model that we can

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,100
actually solve problems with now we know

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,180
as we add more and more data there's

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,800
going to be more more patterns in that

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,480
data so we have to have more nodes and

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,240
it becomes a little complicated even

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,040
more but the good news is with effort

00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,230
and I think we already started hearing

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,940
about some great efforts today and with

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,690
the right compute model we can actually

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,610
get incredible insights now the benefit

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,680
of working at Nvidia is I get to work

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,450
with a lot of customers I get to see a

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,670
lot of industries and we talk to people

00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,470
that have adopted the Nvidia compute

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,149
model because they're trying to overcome

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,729
some of the complications that they had

00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:14,789
in early attempts machine learning nai

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,520
now we've seen incredible expansion a

00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:19,710
number of frameworks and platforms

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,679
most people use tensorflow but we also

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,539
see CNT K we're seeing a lot in cafe 2

00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:26,340
we're seeing a lot of pie towards we're

00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:28,049
seeing chaos a lot of things are coming

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,240
on and these things are being optimizing

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,729
really getting great gains but we're

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,369
also seeing a lot of AI research leaders

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,560
and just the industry as a whole and our

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:38,670
customers adopting new modes right so I

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,159
think some of the things we just heard

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,499
of now we're seeing an object detection

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,109
or image detection a lot of CNN's but

00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:47,579
obviously we're also seeing a lot when

00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,799
you're going on to trying to fund on

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,389
label data how do I get through that and

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,670
so we're seeing a lot of unsupervised

00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:57,030
learning we're seeing a lot of actually

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,710
autoencoders coming on if our customers

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,450
are in financial services or healthcare

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,450
and they're actually trying to find time

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,979
sequence data they're using a lot of RNs

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,869
the same when you're actually trying to

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,920
do social media the same when you're

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,289
actually trying to go through a lot of

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,870
the process of text when you're trying

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,820
to do translation or encoding from there

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,640
so we're seeing a lot of different

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,920
approaches and a lot of great successes

00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,680
that

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,239
based on this new model and that's why I

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,130
do like the fact I've been called the

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,750
new new oil because it is it actually

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,220
solves a lot of problems and we're

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,050
seeing a lot of great solutions coming

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,430
out of the training but we can't forget

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,680
the importance of inference with

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,420
technologies like tents RT that actually

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,640
are optimizing the deployment and that

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,620
becomes really key when we're rolling

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
these services out and it leads to a

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,160
true success and I actually want to

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,630
spend the most of my time now talking

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,360
about some of those successes so let's

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,880
jump in so one is a future success an

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,530
announcement we just made with boats

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,970
wagon at the Auto Show that's going on

00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,410
in Europe right now

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,299
boats wagon has announced that they're

00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,970
going to be incorporating NVIDIA GPU AI

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,160
advanced machines systems into their new

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,410
data lab what's really cool about this

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,760
day lab is that it's going to be weather

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,230
data scientists are going to be doing

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,940
all sorts of projects but one that I

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,260
actually think is really cool is that

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,049
they're going to be focusing on how to

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,989
solve and understand and optimize

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:19,060
traffic through cities but what's also

00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:20,739
great about this is it's the cornerstone

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,480
of a new startup program that they're

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,450
launching and the startup program is

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,880
focused on funding so helping with

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,670
financial but also technical help to

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,010
startups that are focused on the

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,570
automobile industry and I think we can't

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,010
underestimate the importance of this

00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,600
because it's these startups they're

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,820
going to be driving a lot of change and

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,350
bring a lot of value so we spend a lot

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,000
of time in the automobile companies but

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,560
this is one really things that I think

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,590
is really exciting so let's talk about

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,989
some others so Athol s is another one

00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,880
they focus on deep learning for portable

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:53,859
diagnostics and the device that you're

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,230
seeing here is a diagnostic that

00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,120
actually can take a drop of blood and do

00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,799
analysis of that blood really quick they

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,709
like to point out that it's one drop of

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,810
blood two minutes and preventative

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:06,370
health care now this has already gone

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,430
through clinical trials it's available

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,380
in in clinics around the country as well

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,569
as in patients homes and it's going

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,069
through FDA approval right now what's

00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,410
great about it if you think about the

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,510
convenience and the capabilities of

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,840
letting patients do their white blood

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,820
count tests at home these tests are

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,640
indicators of how the Leukemia is

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,340
proceeding if your early indications of

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,610
information or infection it's also an

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,650
indicator whether your

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,750
relapse so the ability to actually

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,680
detect this and solve this is a great

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,270
component now to do this FMS actually

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,490
uses chaos and tensorflow

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,840
they do both supervised learning for

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,189
when they're actually creating the base

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,780
models and going from there and

00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:49,550
unsupervised learning when they're

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,780
trying to do the labeling and actually

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,550
speed up that whole process as they

00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,629
bring more and more tests in and then

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,370
finally they have a reinforcement

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,139
learning process that they use when they

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,349
have a back-end dashboard that they

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,150
actually have to label another example

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:04,280
completely different industry is deep

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,409
instinct deep instinct focuses on

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,110
cybersecurity and they've created a

00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:12,969
comprehensive defense against the most

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,440
evasive malware that is attacking PCs

00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:17,569
endpoints servers mobile devices and

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,389
really the folks on mobile device is so

00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:22,460
important because by 2020 80 percent of

00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:25,759
us will access our enterprise networks

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,819
via mobile devices so this focus has

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,189
made them able to actually have zero day

00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:32,960
which is when you have a malfunction or

00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,120
a hole in your software and hackers can

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,550
attack it and advanced persistent threat

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,460
protection in real time with

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,440
unprecedented accuracy so that is really

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,849
great now when they were going down this

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,379
process they realized they couldn't use

00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:46,610
CNN's and some of the other frameworks

00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,339
that are out there and the different

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,020
models was because they actually work

00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,210
off raw binary files where all binary

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,740
files don't actually have location

00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,240
correlation like an image does so you

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,740
can actually say pixel to pixel and how

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,839
it looks from there so they had to

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,180
develop their own framework it's a

00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,710
proprietary framework based on CUDA that

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,259
is actually lightweight efficient and

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:08,599
really is focused on cybersecurity all

00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:09,949
their training is supervised but the

00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:11,599
fact that they have millions and

00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:14,150
hundreds of millions of files both

00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,889
malicious and legitimate files many form

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,250
factors that they put through is their

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:21,830
strength another company which is not a

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,770
start-up actually is probably if not one

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,409
of the largest software companies in the

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,490
world s ap s AP made a great

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,659
announcement recently where they

00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,849
announced that are having a whole

00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:33,400
portfolio of machine learning services

00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:36,589
that they develop with deep learning

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,150
it's their Leonardo brand this one that

00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:39,649
I'm showing you here is actually really

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,969
interesting to me because it's focusing

00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,529
on customer service and I think it was

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,669
great to follow on Salesforce to

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,340
highlight the importance of this

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,229
the service ticket intelligence actually

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,999
learns and understands the semantics of

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:53,460
an unstructured message so when the

00:06:50,999 --> 00:06:56,550
message comes in it can actually auto

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,620
classify it and route it based on its

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,229
priority customer or the problem itself

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,599
and then the best part is it starts

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:05,400
recommending the best answers and the

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,340
knowledge-based articles that will solve

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,960
that problem sa P uses tensorflow

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,419
pretty much across the board for this

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,529
particular service that use CNN and

00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:15,539
they're actually using a tentative

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,740
mechanism to help guide the process to

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,629
choose the appropriate words to get the

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,789
most accuracy out of it so it's a really

00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:23,460
good thing they're doing there all right

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,479
digital genius for anybody that might be

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,919
Dutch in the audience you will be

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,740
feeling very familiar with the service

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,150
KLM uses it it's an AI assisted and

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,979
fully autonomous really helps the

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,270
customer operations how do you interact

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,789
with your customer how do you give them

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,589
data one of the great things they're

00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,879
doing here and I really think this is

00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,580
going to be something that helps abduct

00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,560
AI to the enterprise they're plugging it

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,689
directly in they integrate directly with

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,669
the leading customer service software so

00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,039
whether it's Salesforce s ap Zendesk

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:51,659
others and has that and uses the

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,279
standard communication devices whether

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,860
it's your email or other components it

00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,250
makes it work they use tensorflow for

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,479
research pi torch for their production

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,219
they're supervised learning is for

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,050
creating the question-and-answer modules

00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:05,990
and they use unsupervised learning for

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,180
the rest of the process

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:11,069
all right data log actually data log is

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,719
a great company because they focus on

00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,610
what a lot of us has been struggling

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:18,419
with for quite some time data ingestion

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,379
right so they use deep learning powered

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,449
sort of pipelines

00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,370
that prepare data for this ingestion

00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,620
process and so if you think about it

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,180
they work with a lot of Fortune 1000

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,589
companies and what they're helping them

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,759
do is they they have this all this data

00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:31,319
and they want to use in other

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,510
applications and they take it through a

00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,099
pipeline and work from there I like to

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,680
think of this as sort of the future of

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,659
where ETL is going except the way they

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,419
like to talk about it is get know and

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,459
transfer so in the get process they're

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,230
using a data graph which is great for

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,880
storing the data coming from there but

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,360
the real magic comes in the know

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,399
capability so data log ontology mappers

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,350
which really just models that

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,510
structurally and semantically understand

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,019
your data then prepare the data and then

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,389
it moves into

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:03,300
the transfer phase so when it's going

00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,189
into this transform phase it focuses on

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,779
what's important to the customer what

00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:08,610
are the characteristics of the data and

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,100
how's it allow the data to more

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,749
transparent whether the the user wants

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,809
it to be and how did it get there and

00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:16,949
again they to actually use a mechanism

00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:18,689
that actually helps guide through the

00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:21,209
process and get it from there they use

00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:22,529
both supervised and unsupervised mostly

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:27,049
supervised in the beginning and then

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:29,790
they build on from there so with that

00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:31,649
I'd like to put out to you all of you we

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,970
have many sessions here today we would

00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:34,049
like to hear from you what are sort of

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,079
the problems you're trying to solve

00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:38,429
which tools do you like to use and where

00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,079
do you want to do this do you want to do

00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,089
in the cloud or you're going to do it on

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,040
Prem I like to thank Ben for the

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,559
call-out for my dgx one product but

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,989
really there's so many opportunities to

00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,970
get started I wish you would a best luck

00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:53,790
at the show happy to engage with you all

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,630
and look forward to a great couple days

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:59,570
thanks so much

00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,570
