Title: Artificial intelligence in the software engineering workflow - Peter Norvig (Google)
Publication date: 2017-06-30
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in new software products, but the workflow of an AI researcher is quite different from the workflow of the software developer. Peter Norvig explains how the two can come together.

	00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:09,860
so the real question is what is it about

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,990
AI programs that make them different why

00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,610
isn't it just more software right

00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,820
because we've had changes in the past

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:20,660
right we went from command lines to

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:22,999
Windows and we had to learn some new

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,800
api's but it was still just software and

00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,490
the software processes didn't change

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,519
that much

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:30,859
why should adding AI change the

00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,530
processes isn't it just a new

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,079
application area and I think there's a

00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,570
number of fundamental reasons why that's

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,829
not the case why a I really is different

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:47,390
and the first one is the content the

00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:50,269
stuff that we're building is now a model

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,670
and not a program and we've spent the

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,769
last 40 years building up tools to

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,550
create these programs these program text

00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:01,789
and our IDE s with our color coding and

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,910
so on that are designed to make us deal

00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:07,160
with the text in a good way and now

00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,960
we're writing we're creating models

00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,299
instead of text and we just don't have

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,880
the tools to deal with that so we need

00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:18,170
to retool the industry to be able to

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,079
deal with a different type of model that

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,040
we're dealing with the second part is

00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:28,780
the processes so we have a debugging

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,250
process and we we have our issues

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,409
databases and we have our debugging

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,509
tools and so on and when we get a

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,509
problem we know how to go about fixing

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:40,939
it but with an AI system it's not quite

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:43,759
like that when you get a problem you

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,460
give it more training data and it starts

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,020
to converge to a better answer but the

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,240
bug hasn't gone away

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,360
it's just been hidden and it may come

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,329
back we don't have a way of closing bugs

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,880
out with machine learning in the same

00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,729
way that we do with traditional

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,880
debugging the release cycle is different

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,759
in traditional software we know how the

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,700
release cycle goes we know we countdown

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,670
all the bugs we want to fix we countdown

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,760
all the features we want to add we go

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,920
through the testing cycle and go

00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,959
pass all the regression tests and then

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:25,849
we ship an upgrade and and celebrate in

00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,849
machine learning is not necessarily like

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,370
that we may have models that are online

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,640
where every millisecond they're getting

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:37,430
new input in and they're modifying

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,709
themselves and changing we don't have

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,440
time to rerun all the regression tests

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,650
every millisecond so we need new

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,849
processes to deal with this new faster

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:55,129
release cycle and then there's a lot of

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:57,379
issues around uncertainty where AI

00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:00,079
systems are fundamentally dealing with

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:03,019
uncertainty whereas traditional software

00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:07,040
is fundamentally trying to hide

00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:10,280
uncertainty and first is it deposited

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,629
over here I want that to be $100 more

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,680
and if it doesn't happen we can be

00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,290
definitive of whether we're doing the

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,049
right thing or not but now say we're

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,750
trying to do something like detect fraud

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:25,669
in a bank transaction that's a

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,910
fundamentally different process we can't

00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:31,180
say for sure this is fraud and this is

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,160
not we can only say that

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:38,120
probabilistically and we can't say for

00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:41,299
sure what's the cost of denying a

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,639
transaction what if this was a valid

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,780
transaction and we turned it down we

00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,310
don't know for sure what the cost is

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,260
we're not even sure exactly what our

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,269
objectives are and that's something that

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,269
we have to discover rather than

00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,599
something that we're given so that type

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:59,180
of uncertainty adds to the difficulty of

00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,680
dealing with AI and changes the process

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,680
for how software is developed

00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,390
