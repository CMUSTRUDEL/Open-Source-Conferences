hi this is Mike Hendrickson from AI in

00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,210
New York City I'm here with fiies from

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,960
Intel guys how you doing good how are

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,870
you good

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,049
so Intel I think a lot of people think

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,369
of you as a Silicon company and yet AI

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,560
it was like kind of eating the world or

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,150
major part of your your future right can

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,859
you unpack a little bit about your

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,500
product roadmap and where you guys are

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,240
going absolutely so you know I've been

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,429
told I think one of our biggest goals is

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,349
to pinging as doing a shortened the

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,899
innovation cycle when it comes to ax

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,360
play and a big part of that is silicon

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,370
so one of the things we're doing really

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,140
well I think is building the next

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,090
generation of processors that will

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,280
activate a lot of easy deep running

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,140
workloads but it's a lot more than that

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,000
it's not just about hardware

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,559
acceleration it's about sort of building

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,770
the right software stack that will let

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,680
our customers at enterprise finds build

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,270
and scale these models to really large

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
deployments right so a lot of our

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,170
efforts are going into building the

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
right sort of software tools that enable

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,229
an enablement tools that will let our

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,080
clients do that so you have a pretty

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,210
really strong roadmap of both silicon

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,580
and software tools that will help our

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,619
clients get there so you know Intel is

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,420
much more than a so they can come in

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,040
today so you're investing heavily in the

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,340
United States was that part of a eyes

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,080
problem back in the late 80s we didn't

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,000
have the computing power and to actually

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,979
do what we need to do and we're now at

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,560
the point in time where AI is a reality

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,509
or it can be a reality yeah that's part

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,369
of it so you know the compute was

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,470
definitely a bottleneck right so today

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,150
we have a really fast processor that can

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,860
process like really large amounts of

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,090
data but I think that the other side of

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,640
that equation is also the availability

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,740
of data itself it's the way a lot of

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,930
these AI models work is you have to

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,869
literally train the model just like you

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,640
would train a human brain right and and

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,130
data is a big component of that right

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,369
and so with the explosion of big data

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,320
over the last decade or so a lot of our

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,649
enterprise clients now have access to

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,360
that data that they can use to to to

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,670
claim these models so essentially it's a

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,240
it's a mix of you know compute being

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,080
read it is today and

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,460
the availability of data to support that

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,320
you mentioned a lot of your partners

00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,070
you're working with are there industries

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,530
that are going in quicker than others

00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,260
and are there ones that should be going

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,000
in quicker absolutely so I mean the more

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,590
in the popular ones like the automotive

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,170
space for example and you get a lot

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,360
about autonomous driving AI is a big

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,430
component of enabling that but we're

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,330
also seeing you seeing adoption across

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,160
the board healthcare financial services

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,230
you know medical imaging is specifically

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,240
within the healthcare space we're also

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,700
seeing a lot of interest in sort of

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,080
insurance media companies right they

00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:55,000
want to be able to process and tack a

00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,710
lot of their content that they produce

00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,500
over the last few decades so there's a

00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,150
lot of interest across the board you

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,460
know one of the more active industries I

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,350
think is the well the industrial space

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,540
so we're doing a lot of work with

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,340
clients where you know they're using

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,530
drones to capture images in real time

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,800
and do inference looking for anomalies

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,360
in an industrial deployment for example

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,110
there's a lot of interest across the

00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,630
board but again it's very early it's a

00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,430
lot of our clients are still just

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,050
starting to understand the implications

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,030
of AI and what it means to them and how

00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,250
it's going to affect their industry so a

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,930
lot of work that we do is sort of

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,180
helping them understand this this

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,920
implication enabling a lot of these use

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,870
cases and getting them started but then

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,160
once that happens there they start

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,810
looking at to the really large scale

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,550
deployments and that's where the real

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,070
power of Intel comes in because we can

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,470
really enable that end-to-end so you

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,960
work with your partners basically the

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,350
whole sack I mean you guys have from

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,950
Silicon all the way up to managing and

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,690
deploying at a consumer front end well

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,580
it's learning about consumer behavior

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,530
and then predicting sure yeah so the way

00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,390
we look at it I mean it's it's yes it's

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,800
up and down the stack but it's also all

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,960
the way from the data center to the edge

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,600
it's if you think about sort of where we

00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,030
put our investment your silicon is a big

00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,530
component of it obviously right but you

00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,359
know building the right set of tools in

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,980
the software stack we also have data

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,590
scientists for example on our team that

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,040
can help you know sit side-by-side with

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:22,390
a client

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,760
actually co-develop some of these

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,060
solutions but also as you think about to

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,030
the deploying AI if you look at sort of

00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,320
the overall you know workflow you you're

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,090
talking about sort of training an AI

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,400
model and then eventually maybe

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,440
deploying it not only in the data center

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,700
but potentially on the edge as well so

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,860
you can train these models in a

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,750
large-scale data center deployment but

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,910
then you know maybe you're deploying it

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,640
on on a farm or maybe on a drone

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,560
collision sensor exactly and so our

00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,330
capabilities run across the board the

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,520
perspective board hardware software but

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,800
also you know from the data center to a

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,650
gateway to an edge that's where the real

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,900
sort of influence of Intel comes in

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,640
because we can build up and support all

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,260
those sorts of different it's so one

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,810
model yet the edge is a really

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,630
interesting place and the edge typically

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,770
mean IOT devices and things that are out

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:18,250
in the wild your platform your your

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,820
offerings we work with unstructured like

00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:24,550
things that we may not know that well it

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,560
does so in terms of the types of data we

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,020
can support I mean looking at if you

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,600
look at sort of the broad AI space and

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,460
where the majority of investors and a

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,810
lot of it is around imaging for example

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,350
but there's also things like natural

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,970
language processing speech understanding

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,650
you know you're looking at sort of time

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,840
series data and the financial services

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,030
industry for example the time series is

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,650
also very prevalent in the IOT space so

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,630
you have sensors that are collecting a

00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,100
lot of data and you want to as you're

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,290
measuring these things you can start to

00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,880
predict let's say a failure of a piece

00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,180
of equipment based on the sensor data

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,430
that you're getting so as a software

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,200
stack we can support all those different

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,660
types of use cases so the way we look at

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,400
the world really is around the fact that

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,260
like what are the types of data you're

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,850
trying to process and the software stack

00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,200
is robust enough where we can support

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,880
all those different types of use cases

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,580
but also from a hardware perspective

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,170
then you have different constraints

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,390
based on radio doing training and we're

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,070
doing it prints for example right so if

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,230
it's on the edge you have a specific

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,570
power requirements and we week build a

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,650
silicon to sort of you know support all

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,700
those different types of workloads

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,340
giving the scan

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,190
Trainz it's a really good sort of makes

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,410
a little targeting software to support

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,940
different things so if you and I sit

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,220
down 12 months from now and have this

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,590
conversation I actually it's not 12

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,930
months it's in April which is probably a

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,270
good time frame you know from the wood

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,010
set seven months from now this industry

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,860
changes so quickly what would you like

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,590
to see change in the industry and then

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,520
what would you like to see Intel doing

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,640
differently that you're not doing today

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,830
I think it with respect to the industry

00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,450
itself I think a lot of our clients

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,430
again they're just starting to

00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,290
understand what AI means to them right

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,550
and so you know from an adoption

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,770
perspective I've seen a real

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:11,230
acceleration in terms of you know where

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:15,400
you have come in the last like you know

00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,840
18 24 months right and I continue to see

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,110
that acceleration so there's a lot of

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,220
interest there's a lot of real-world

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:24,040
deployments happening today that wasn't

00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,680
happening let's say 12 months ago and so

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,810
for me that that's a really good

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,400
indicator of where AI is going so it's

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,890
starting up as you know a small

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,930
experiment let's say in a innovation

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,730
center within a large enterprise but now

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,260
you're seeing adoption across the board

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:40,030
across the different views and there are

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,280
specific use cases going to be here we

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,050
are targeting so that's great and that's

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,270
what I think that continue that will

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,800
continue to happen from an Intel

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,500
perspective I think you know what again

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,320
we want to be treated as we want to be

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,260
to keep allies and partners for our

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,140
customers and clients with respect to AI

00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:03,430
right and so as they step back and think

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:05,500
about the RAI strategy you know we want

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,200
to be there to sort of help define that

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,540
and support that over time so you know

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,880
whether it's a small experiment in a lab

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,170
within a large enterprise or is here you

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,110
know thinking about sort of really large

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:20,470
gauge scale deployments across the the

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,710
the company those are you know different

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:26,230
types of things that we can support and

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,630
I think we see that as a priority is we

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,920
want to be able to you know it'll

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,300
specular where you are we want to be

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,919
able to support whatever it is you're

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,330
doing and then help you craft that

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:36,670
strategy as you go forward

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,950
excellent if I as we look forward to our

00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,700
new absolute collaboration and work with

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,000
you guys in San Francisco thank you

00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,000
thank you

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,029
