	00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,010
hi so I'm going to give a very brief

00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,350
overview of machine learning on the

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,720
Google cloud platform so on the right

00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:19,060
hand side of this slide are the cloud ml

00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,300
api's vision speech natural language

00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:25,070
translate and video intelligence so

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,400
machine learning has been part of

00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,619
Google's DNA for a long time and with

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
these api's were bringing it for

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:34,609
everyday use

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,670
so these api's give you access to

00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:39,950
powerful machine learning models just

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,500
through a REST API without needing any

00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,030
machine learning experience to use so

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,360
you can think of these as models as a

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,550
service and we're really happy to

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,300
announce that just today we're releasing

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,800
the video intelligence API in beta so

00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:59,809
that means it's available for everyone

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,510
to use this API does automatic detection

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,030
of entities in videos and lets you make

00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,619
them discoverable and searchable we've

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,060
got a really fun demo of this at the

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:14,330
booth so in the middle of the slide is

00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:17,659
code ml engine so this gives you a no

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:20,000
ops infrastructure for training and

00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:23,390
serving any tensorflow model that you

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,869
want without the hassle of setting up a

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,369
cluster or provisioning GPUs or figuring

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:30,680
out how to serve your model

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:34,220
once you've trained it so you can think

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,409
of this as ml as a service and there is

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,420
no worry about lock-in so you can train

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,360
on cloud ml engine if you want with a

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,549
GPU cluster serve it elsewhere or vice

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,460
versa you can train elsewhere and then

00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:49,150
use cloud ml scaleable serving if you

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,890
like and then on the left hand side

00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,140
compute as a service so there are many

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,790
ways that you can bring your favorite

00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,460
machine learning framework to a cloud

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:03,020
platform there's data pot which is

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,659
managed to Dupin SPARC and also compute

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:08,780
engine container engine lots of ways to

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,640
to bring your favorite framework so next

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,669
I'm going to really briefly show a

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,370
couple of the ML API so the natural

00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:20,730
language API lets you extract entities

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,730
sentiment and syntax from text so here

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,250
I'm analyzing a sentence so you can see

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,470
that the the API is detecting the

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,040
entities in the sentence and is doing

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,769
sentiment analysis on the entities as

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,810
well as the the larger text and it's

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:40,799
also doing some text mapping and part of

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,709
speech tagging and then the division API

00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,920
this lets you do things like label

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:50,340
detection and learning within an image

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,120
face detection OCR landmark and logo

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,480
detection and lots more so we have just

00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,629
put out a new release of the vision API

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,040
that has a big set of updates to all of

00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:08,730
its features including a much extended

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,870
label vocabulary and increase in model

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:15,060
accuracy by more than 25% so here I'm

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,239
using the vision API this is a picture

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,790
of a bridge in Lisbon and you can see

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,230
that it's detecting not only bridge but

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,480
other things like sky and sea it is it's

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,549
figured out which bridge it is and it's

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,669
it's um showing the location of that on

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,660
a map and it's giving a set of web pages

00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:39,329
that show matched images and a lot more

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:42,209
so these api's you can try them out

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:44,730
yourself from their webpages they're

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,260
really powerful easy to use they're

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:51,150
great for helping to process

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:54,379
unstructured data but maybe you want to

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,440
build some more specialized models so

00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,750
we've open-sourced um a large number of

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,359
tensorflow models some just in the last

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,480
few weeks and you heard about a bunch of

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,790
fun ones from Doug's great talk as well

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,650
so a neat thing about many of these

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,049
models that you can use them for

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,049
transfer learning so you can essentially

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,970
fine-tune them on your own data so

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:20,519
suppose that you wanted to build an app

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,849
that recognized whether an object was

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,530
was huggable so you might have some

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,719
positive training instances of things

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,729
like you know puppies and pillows might

00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:30,820
have some negative training instances of

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,210
things like

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,300
hacksaws and exacto knives so I can use

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,310
this training data and do transfer

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,380
learning basically bootstrap from the

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,450
open-source inception image

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,880
classification model to train a new

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,790
model that does this once I've got my

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,740
trained model I can deploy it to cloud

00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:55,960
ml engine and that gives me a scalable

00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,880
API that I can call say from a web app

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:02,350
to make predictions on on us so I'm just

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,220
going to close with a really quick call

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,770
out to the tensorflow object detection

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,090
API just just recently open source a

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:14,530
couple of weeks ago look for the very

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:17,470
interesting blog post on this so I just

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,330
sort of stressed the surface I hope this

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,040
gave you a bit of a sense of the

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,860
different ways that you can use machine

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,630
learning on Google cloud platform thank

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:29,050
you

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,050
