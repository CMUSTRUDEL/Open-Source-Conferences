Description: 
	AI presents a huge opportunity for businesses to personalize and improve customer experiences and improve efficiency, but the technical complexity of AI puts it out of reach for most companies.

	00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:09,300
and so those three required ingredients

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,269
are labeled theta we agree that it's

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,309
mostly labeled data not just unlabeled

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,560
data though there are a few exceptions

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,970
like word vectors that you can learn

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,010
from large unlabeled text data how to

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,019
get that data is actually an interesting

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,429
question and I'll touch on that in a

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,199
little bit

00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:30,509
the second major ingredient that led us

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,610
to these breakthroughs and all these new

00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:35,070
conferences and old conferences like

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,080
nips and is ml blowing up in size our

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,730
deep learning algorithms mostly

00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,490
recurrent and convolutional neural

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,310
networks and then the last and third

00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,370
ingredient is multi-core compute mostly

00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:50,400
those are NVIDIA GPUs at this point and

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:53,880
I'll see a bright future ahead for for

00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,300
Nvidia but in many cases we can also see

00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,700
how this compute and the GPUs are mostly

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:05,129
commoditized so I won't focus too much

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:07,229
on this in this talk but those are just

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,689
the three ingredients that that is the

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,369
breakthroughs in research now what does

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,619
an actual org structure look like for

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,929
companies to make this into successful

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,149
products where are the actual people and

00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:21,149
what do they do when we move this

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:24,210
research into production and there the

00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:26,670
truth is that while in many cases it

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,350
starts with research especially for

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,030
large organizations especially as you're

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,060
trying to create completely new

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,210
applications once research is done and

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:40,109
we traded new algorithms models optimize

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,909
the optimization algorithms understood

00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:44,280
regularization better of all these very

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,249
powerful deep learning models it then

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,460
actually comes to be a real engineering

00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:53,639
challenge and in many cases the

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,429
engineers have to first work on with

00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:59,189
messy real-life data integrating it from

00:01:56,429 --> 00:02:01,950
different places cleaning it in some

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,079
cases is also up to them to label it if

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,509
you want to give pre-trained classifiers

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,039
to people then they do need to still

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,979
deal with the hardware infrastructure

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,600
then and this is often a big deal they

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,210
have to load balancers and everything

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,590
for scaling and providing easy-to-use

00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,870
api so it's to be

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,209
documentation for them especially when

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,910
you want developers to use your eye

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,400
tools and lastly and this is very

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,770
important you have to really think about

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,510
trust and security their permission

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,489
schemes if you have a large amount of

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,950
data in your organization that everybody

00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:37,080
is supposed to see every aspect of the

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,810
data in some cases and you really have

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,750
to carefully think about that trust it

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:47,700
says was our number one value two and

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:51,269
you cannot forget about that but that's

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,940
also only step two and once you actually

00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,160
want to fully make it successful you

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,680
have to carefully work also with product

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,170
groups they really have to think about

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,599
the workflow integration and that's the

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,950
last major piece you have the algorithms

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,110
the data and the workflow integration

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,870
and these are usually the three groups

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,910
that will work on that and workflow

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,440
integration sometimes especially the

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,190
more technical you are you tend to

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,810
forget about it

00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,700
you just say hey dude is this amazing I

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,400
feature obviously everybody will want to

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,840
use it and then users might feel like

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,700
they're training their own replacement

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,970
and they don't want to use it and then

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,579
it's actually very much a UI problem you

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,980
want to make people feel empowered

00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:36,180
enhanced augmented in many ways instead

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,700
of feeling replaced then you also need

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,650
to be very creative in finding some of

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,709
the applications and computer vision for

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,810
instance but also in text and sometimes

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,370
you need to be creative in understanding

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,799
where your algorithms will actually fail

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,780
so for instance machine translation is

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,959
not yet perfect we cannot translate as

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:58,170
well as people yet we found that if you

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,079
give human translators a raw translation

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,209
of a text they will actually be much

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,340
faster in just fixing that one up

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:08,930
instead of having to go from the

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,930
