Title: Machines as thought partners - David Ferrucci (Elemental Cognition)
Publication date: 2017-06-28
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	AI systems should not only propose solutions or answers but also explain why they make sense. Statistical machine learning is a powerful tool for discovering patterns in data, but, David Ferrucci asks, can it produce understanding or enable humans to justify and take reasoned responsibility for individual outcomes?

	00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:08,650
so I think that's the challenge I have

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,309
another story for you which is a

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,960
personal story about actually my dad it

00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:17,960
was some number of years ago my dad

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,020
actually went into cardiac arrest in a

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:23,119
restaurant and it took a while for the

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,380
ambulance to get there so that

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,939
eventually he got to a hospital and I

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,259
was you know was unfortunately those

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,250
whole party people's lose a bunch of

00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:33,140
people were in the waiting room waiting

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,559
to see what happened it was a prideful

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,239
moment resident comes out and says you

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,269
know your dad's brain-dead and you have

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,789
to sign I do not resuscitate and you

00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:48,589
know I I dare to ask like why like how

00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:50,629
do you know he's brain-dead and of

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:52,219
course they had a statistical model with

00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:55,100
a combination of variables where on

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:56,929
average everything that had happened you

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,030
know the age the wait time for the

00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:00,739
ambulance the blood pressure the

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,249
dilation of the pupils and so forth and

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,890
so on

00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:05,659
you know strongly correlated with you

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,150
know your dad's brain dead there's 98%

00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:11,930
chance I was told but I'm sorry so like

00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,700
if I was betting on this and I had a bet

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,500
a thousand times I do pretty well with

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,230
those odds but this is a very

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,130
asymmetrical risk I need to know exactly

00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,240
why you think my dad the man in that

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,160
room and they were doing all these

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,840
heroic measures at that point trying to

00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,820
keep him alive I'll keep his heart

00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,770
beating while you think he's brain dead

00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,000
and so the resident says well I'm sorry

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,890
I can't help you have to talk to the

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,810
chief cardiologist and I raise the same

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,610
questions with the chief cardiologist he

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,260
said well his pupils are dilated said is

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,590
there another reason why his pupils

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,820
might be dilated and there was a pause

00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,500
well we do give them a drug in the

00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,190
ambulance that dilates the pupils okay

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,190
you got to be kidding me

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,560
so now so no until you can give me the

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,080
ducted evidence that Batman my father's

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,330
brain-dead then I'll talk about signing

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:02,120
a do not resuscitate and I wouldn't sign

00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,790
it long story short the doctor made me

00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:07,220
make all the decisions because he was

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,720
convinced so to decide whether or not he

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,190
should be moved what kinds of drugs

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,470
should be given what the pros and cons

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,880
of the drugs are so here I am making all

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,310
these decisions long story short

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:20,270
eighteen hours later my dad's sitting up

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,770
in bed zero brain damage hey dad and he

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,590
said to me hey Dave I understand you

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:30,340
thought I was dead I don't like ya

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:39,200
alright anyway so you would step back

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:40,820
thank you thank you so we have to step

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,320
back and think about like how do we want

00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,690
to how do we want to imagine what

00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,040
intelligence really is when artificial

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,900
intelligence is going to play a bigger

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,240
bigger role in our lives and there been

00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,190
all these definitions you know some

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,350
attributed to Alan Turing to John

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,380
McCarthy and like one of the things I

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,989
started to submit a proposes can we

00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,850
define a definition that makes us humans

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:06,260
who are designing designing these

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:08,450
intelligences more countable so here's

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,250
one that says computers are intelligent

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,720
if they can learn to answer and explain

00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,910
well enough for humans to take

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,709
individual responsibility for any

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:19,150
decision made on the basis of those

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:22,550
answers yeah that pinches a little bit

00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,980
that stings a little bit and this isn't

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,610
to say that this kind of this kind of

00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,019
accountability should exist in all cases

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,680
but we at least have to step back and

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:36,800
think is this how we should be imagining

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,370
the role of artificial tells where does

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,360
it really matter that we have these

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,860
explanations that we could reason about

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,860
