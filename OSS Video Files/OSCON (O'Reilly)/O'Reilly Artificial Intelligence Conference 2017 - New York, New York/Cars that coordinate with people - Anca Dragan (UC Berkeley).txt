Title: Cars that coordinate with people - Anca Dragan (UC Berkeley)
Publication date: 2017-06-30
Playlist: O'Reilly Artificial Intelligence Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Autonomous cars tend to treat people like obstacles whose motion needs to be anticipated so that the car can best stay out of their way, resulting in ultradefensive cars that can't coordinate with people. Anca Dragan demonstrates how learning and optimal control can be leveraged to generate car behavior that results in natural coordination strategies.

	00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,729
this is a glorious video where it's not

00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,490
autonomous driving it's human human

00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:12,440
interaction and it goes very wrong so

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,570
here we have a truck driver going along

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,080
the highway at some constant velocity

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,210
and then we have the second car that

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,829
puts its blinker on and tries to merge

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,239
in as well but the truck driver just

00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:29,960
keeps going alright so so this hog

00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,180
driver is basically saying it's your job

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,010
to stay out of my way I'm just going to

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,040
keep doing what I'm doing right you'll

00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,500
get out of my way and do two things are

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,940
interesting about this the first thing

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,830
that's interesting is that an autonomous

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,590
car today would never do this would

00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,320
never do what this would this second car

00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:50,300
this black car is doing because an

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,340
autonomous car today would try to

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,080
predict what the truck driver is going

00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,310
to do it's pretty easy to predict

00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,290
they're just going to keep going and

00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,090
plan to stay out of its way so if

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:03,440
there's not a big enough gap in traffic

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,449
then you don't merge but kind of the

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,210
second interesting thing is that while

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,170
autonomous cars would not do this at all

00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,750
today unless there's some sort of

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:15,500
perception failure I do this all the

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,760
time so I mean I live in San Francisco I

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,190
have to commute to Berkeley I have to

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,340
drive on the Bay Bridge every single day

00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:24,380
there and back and if I didn't if I

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,710
waited for a big enough gap in traffic

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,020
every single time I needed to actually

00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,299
switch alene take an exit or something

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,880
like that I wouldn't get to work on time

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:38,780
right and going back to the truck

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,760
example I mean how many of us here would

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,450
actually behave the way the truck driver

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,210
behaved

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,850
I mean maybe sound but probably most of

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,450
us would actually slow down in reaction

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:52,220
to what that car did and let it merchan

00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,229
so as most of us would not act that way

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,270
then it seems a little silly that we're

00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,939
tell essentially telling all autonomous

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,729
cars to treat us as if we're all going

00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,080
to act like this truck driver and this

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:05,840
might sound a little strange but if you

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,729
think about it when we say look the

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,709
person is an obstacle that's moving your

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,270
job is to predict what how it's going to

00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,209
move next and get out of its way

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,130
we're basically treating every single

00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,960
person as if they're going to act

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:21,490
the way the truck driver acted not

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,490
