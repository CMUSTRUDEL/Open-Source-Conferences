Description: 
	Autonomous cars tend to treat people like obstacles whose motion needs to be anticipated so that the car can best stay out of their way, resulting in ultradefensive cars that can't coordinate with people. Anca Dragan demonstrates how learning and optimal control can be leveraged to generate car behavior that results in natural coordination strategies.
