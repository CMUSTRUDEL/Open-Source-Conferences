	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
it's my pleasure to introduce Jimmy Q

00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,460
vice president and general manager at

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,259
Nvidia

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,830
great welcome so good to be here

00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,460
wonderful now we're here talking about

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:16,710
AI transformation is an enterprise could

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,660
you give me a bit of an overview yeah

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,039
it's I mean I think we have to have a

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,570
broader picture of an enterprise I mean

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,189
enterprises do many things they're

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,990
they're in manufacturing you know

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,010
they're taking care of customers they're

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,949
trying to solve all sorts of problems

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,650
and I think what's exciting is a and the

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,239
enterprises I think it's the rebirth of

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,090
IOT we could almost say it that way

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,410
because no longer it's as IT and spend

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,149
on technology need to be focused on

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,829
cost-cutting and taking the pain out of

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,750
things and just try to figure out how to

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,489
solve the number of employees it can be

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,140
focused on customer service it can be

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,390
focused on product development it can be

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,610
focused on literally how do we grow the

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,289
business and rejuvenate the business so

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,820
that's the really exciting part and a

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,629
lot of the examples are coming along or

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,149
doing just that

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,770
what kind of example thing of bringing

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,629
that kind of value out of IT well think

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,640
about it so you know there's products

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,110
even companies like Procter & Gamble

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,790
that are developing products using AI

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,320
that make it easier to understand their

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,000
consumer products so when you're in

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,530
retail location and you're trying to

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,060
find out what skin product about you

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,770
take a selfie of yourself does auto

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,200
detect you know whether you have crow's

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,729
feet or dry skin or oily skin and then

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,729
recommends the lotions that are

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,570
appropriate and they've seen you know

00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:25,140
satisfaction rates go from the 60

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,720
percent up to 90 you have a financial

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,400
banks and companies are doing and great

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,570
improvements on fraud detection right

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,920
like how many times you've ever used a

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,500
credit card and you were traveling a lot

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,790
so your spending levels gone up and so

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,110
they think oh you've never been that

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,610
location before so they stopped your

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,380
credit card right what do most of us do

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,720
I pull out a different credit card and

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,369
swipe that so they lose business so they

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,009
know they need to actually study that

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,470
the patterns more and really get into

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,210
what the consumer base is doing with

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,649
these credit cards to make it better so

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,479
that they don't actually pull out that

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,119
competing credit card and swipe it so

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,820
things like that um we're seeing so much

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,140
in customer service and I think that's

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,399
going to be one of the most amazing and

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,200
well it's because of natural language

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,829
processing natural angle understanding

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,560
is getting better

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,360
and when you get that level you can now

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,730
get to a point where chatbots are going

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
to be so much more successful and I

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,069
actually believe and I'm going to go and

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,590
make prediction I think with any

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,819
year most of us are when we dial in and

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,650
call customer service we're going to

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,079
hope to get that chat we're going to

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,599
hope to get because who wants to push

00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:26,069
seven to get annoyed - be on hold longer

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,590
and you know go through that whole

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,540
process just to come across a human who

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,010
can only is authorized to take a bit of

00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,049
information it doesn't have the ability

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,310
to look it up now think about if that

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,200
person on the other line

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,450
could do quick queries at the speed of

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,889
thought sub second times and get the

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,499
information that that person's looking

00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:45,329
for or if it could just be handled via

00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,250
natural language processing and

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,079
understanding it's going to be so much

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,819
better learning experience I'm I'm

00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,049
hoping it's even less than a year I'm

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,590
looking forward at that particular

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,919
future

00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,510
so in face of customer service and

00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,280
definitely in finance I'm also talking

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,659
about retail what are the kind of

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,040
verticals worth kind of industries with

00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,109
me oh we're seeing just about everything

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,209
I mean clearly yeah so it's it's

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:07,560
pervasive and we say retail retail

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:08,609
started in the distribution centers

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,799
right distribution center has been

00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,599
automated like crazy from now but we're

00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:14,430
not that far from the smart cart the

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,590
smart endcap you know as people walk

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,629
through great company has been doing

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,979
great things I mean s ap has been strong

00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,720
in retail for years where they could

00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,280
actually know a lot of information but

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,680
now they're going to be automating that

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,810
as well and you know I mentioned s ap

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,079
because we talked about AI we always

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,459
think it's Jean le Facebook Google $0.10

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:34,319
you know these big companies doing it

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,629
but sa piece but doing some really great

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,459
stuff where they sit on an incredible

00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:40,349
amount of data very structured data very

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,329
well labeled data and so now they're

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,280
developing AI applications that are

00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,810
going to be automating every Enterprise

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,120
application we could possibly think of

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,970
if you're an SOP customer from service

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,159
ticketing to invoice processing we might

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,409
think it's amazing how long it takes to

00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,329
close a quarter because we're just

00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:59,129
trying to count the invoices and make it

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:00,449
work and balance it between accounts

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,909
payable accounts receivable an invoice

00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,680
that should be automated it's just a

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,680
it's just a you know an activity that

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,180
can and is being automated today now you

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,639
mentioned my data sets and particularly

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,069
about labeled it yes you to describe a

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,530
little bit there about how the impact is

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:19,169
of having a label data set and so

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,219
obviously when you're training AI when

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:23,010
you're doing deep learning you're

00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:25,050
actually doing the more the better the

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,860
data you have the better the output you

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,930
can get right

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,360
so a lot of the process goes into

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,770
labeling the data sets and actually

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,150
trying to annotate the data sets and

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,479
understand what's going on the data set

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,189
so if you already have that done and

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,889
that's why we're seeing such amazing

00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:42,389
activity at healthcare right how many

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,520
retinal scans are already out there good

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,469
bad etc so if you train a data set up

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,699
you know easel that data set it can tell

00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,710
you amazing things about your health

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,810
because your retinal is like the window

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,159
to that doing the exact same thing in

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,490
business is where we're going to see a

00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,830
lot going on I see it in traffic

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,379
patterns network traffic patterns are

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,879
just patterns so if you know what a

00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:04,289
normal pattern is because watching it

00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,330
and this is a normal traffic going

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,669
through it's much easier to detect an

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,740
anomaly so there's a lot going on in

00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:12,210
cybersecurity we see an end point

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,870
detection now we got people like deep

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,599
instinct

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,669
silence doing that it's just going to

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,050
that's why when you ask which parts of

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:21,300
enterprise writes in every part of

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,729
enterprise interesting and and it is

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,279
being brought out to these industries

00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:29,189
through suppliers like I said these are

00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:31,289
there other kinds of ways that AI stay

00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:33,509
into the enterprise also the internal

00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,889
developer the internal and then the

00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:36,779
developer I say developers the data

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,699
scientists becoming you know the AI

00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:41,099
specialists and they're really upgrading

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,479
their skills or they're going to things

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,089
like deep learning Institute and they're

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,440
learning new new skills and then taking

00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:48,419
it to the next step they're being able

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,520
to download open source components

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,680
whether it's tensorflow from you know

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,229
Google or Microsoft just open the

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,729
cognitive toolkit we do a lot to

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,740
actually optimize those things and make

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,870
it much easier to install so we don't

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,159
have to go through the 380 some pages of

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,889
documentation it takes to do these

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:07,169
things and make it as simple as possible

00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:08,550
but we're seeing a lot of internal

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,439
developers but I mentioned financial

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,689
services again the quants of old

00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,370
interview who did day trading all day

00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:16,199
and then actually had to do hand coded

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,969
machine learning the analyzer trades are

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,800
more and more turning to AI and deep

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:21,449
learning again studying the patterns

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,089
they have the date of what they've done

00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,349
and automating that whole process now

00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,839
that's interesting in terms of work

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,370
force so in that case with a quant we're

00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,479
talking about people who are already in

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,039
this position they have the domain

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,219
knowledge now they're being augmented

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,659
yes yes definitely in you just hit the

00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:38,879
point the guys with the domain knowledge

00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:41,039
are the guys are going to be strong here

00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,479
I mean we're getting away from the days

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,459
where when you want to come out with

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,020
software it's like let's come up with a

00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:48,330
feature set figure out I'm going to hand

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,309
code that do that for nine months to

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,229
about three months of testing and

00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,490
regression testing and then out 12

00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:55,589
months later comes a you know software

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,729
release it's about data it's about

00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,649
understanding what it is and you're

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,119
using data to train and actually come up

00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:02,249
with the feature sets of it there

00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:04,199
what kind of key technologies then are

00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:06,240
driving these chemical information yeah

00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,520
you know one of the I think the one of

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,169
the cool ones is that's been i-i've been

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,740
looking for this to come for years is

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,689
basically the ability to understand the

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,719
data by using deep learning itself in AI

00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:21,269
itself so think about it it's just a

00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,039
pattern and I had so much unstructured

00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,539
data and the process of going through

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,979
and annotating all that data and labor

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,479
and all that data and there's

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,909
crowdsourcing efforts to do that there's

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,089
all sorts of ways of doing it but if a I

00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:34,319
can learn to label itself if I label the

00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,729
data itself and go through the process

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,189
and there's companies like data log

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,809
they're actually making some great

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,909
strides in this area and we're seeing it

00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:43,589
to some degree right we started off with

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:45,930
image recognition remember with every

00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:48,419
Beverly great it can recognize a dog and

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,610
go from there but now more and more AI

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,189
is actually seeing the contacts inside

00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,990
images right so you're getting the

00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,300
context and its labeling images and

00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,610
that's showing up in social media but

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,709
it's also moving into smart cities it's

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,229
giving to security right so they could

00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:05,759
actually at some point look at our video

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:07,559
together and label what we're doing and

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,439
how we were going about this so I think

00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,300
that's an amazing component wonderful

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,789
that that gets into some areas of say

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,860
unsupervised learning nests or I guess

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,079
another way would be you trained at work

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,639
in one domain but then can use transfer

00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:23,369
learning applies from the program to

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,079
another and yeah so I think we're going

00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,219
from the supervised learning which I

00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,899
think we pretty much got that under

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,249
control over we'll be using that with

00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,669
robots for a while which is a good thing

00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:34,709
and then I think where we're getting to

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,959
the unsupervised learning and transfer

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,279
learning but also gams the adversarial

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,889
networks which i think is one of the

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,069
most exciting areas because now you have

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:45,839
one network trying to be whether it's

00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:47,189
learn the style picasso is as easy as

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,839
possible and the other one is trying to

00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:50,790
fool it and what comes out the other

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,440
side is one that's really good at

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,000
detecting whether it's truly

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Casso or not and one that's actually

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,510
really good at imitating the style of

00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,910
Picasso that's going to move into so

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,760
many other things we're seeing adobe

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,160
using AI for actually creating the next

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,720
fonts if you train if you train a

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,410
network on all the fonts that ever

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,240
existed

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,160
the next bee's knees is probably going

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,310
to come from an AI who suggested

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,780
something like isn't difficult idea or

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,340
car designers who are training when all

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,210
the headlights that ever existed so when

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,400
they're trying to think of the next

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,320
headlight they can actually brainstorm

00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,230
with an AI right and go through that

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,840
process so it's really amazing how that

00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:29,790
happen and so it is true there's going

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,830
to be different approaches for what

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,970
you're trying to accomplish and I think

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,460
we're just at the beginning I mean it's

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,710
only been four or five years exactly

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,200
since you know Alex Chris Chesky gave us

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,520
it's a brilliant approach and I think

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,060
it's going to be so much more exciting

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,710
in the future excellent any favorite

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,290
current cases of ganz that you've seen

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,390
examples that you like well facial

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,240
recognition is one of the best ones well

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,370
because we need to actually start

00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,920
tricking the ability to recognize it

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,660
because like when you see we see each

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,770
other right I could probably recognize

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,050
you with a hat if you change your

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,150
glasses if it was a dark room or light

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,620
room etc but if we're just trained on

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,810
perfect images we're not going to get

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,940
this we can use ganz to actually try to

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,620
office gate you know do different

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,800
components and and make it more

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,360
difficult because if you really want to

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,430
and there are companies like sense time

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,310
out of China who want to use your face

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:26,400
as a payment capability right right so

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,990
if you can do face pay and you have the

00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,940
ability to actually recognize what such

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,580
certitude that that's the right person

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,840
whether they have a hat on glasses etc

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,820
think about what we can do in security

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,960
think what we can do and you know you

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,660
know things that are going on around

00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,130
Silicon Valley one of the funniest

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,110
things that someone explained to me is a

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,089
great use case that most companies can

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,310
use today is this idea of tailgating

00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:50,700
when someone walks into your company and

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,860
someone follows you in if they follow

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,330
you in and your own video camera but you

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,950
don't actually know if they're an

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,480
employee or not if they're not an

00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,830
employee and they tailgate it in you

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,600
should be able to know that in real time

00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,160
around and the amount of loss that

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,170
happens inside Silicon Valley in these

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,120
big companies of people get in the door

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,370
steal a couple laptops and get

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,950
out quick is we don't think about it but

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,170
happens a lot so just a simple thing

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,650
like that will start playing into how we

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,510
go about our lives any other kinds of

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,000
enabling technologies that you're seeing

00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,339
on the horizon yeah so I think just the

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,290
faster access to data as well I'm so we

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,180
have vast amounts of data and we've

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,740
started into dupe and other technologies

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,710
and that's great we're able to extract

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,310
us out but if we can get those into

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,220
solutions that actually give a

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,630
subsection sub-second access to those um

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,279
is going to be much better I mean if

00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,589
we're trying to query data to understand

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,140
it in the data prep process and it takes

00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:44,670
me a minute to two minutes every query

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,410
we think that's no big deal

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,850
but that's not real time and it's sort

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,010
of frustrating in my process of

00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,200
exploring my data so now there's more

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,330
these these databases that are living on

00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,190
top of GPUs and other you know these

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,600
technologies or in memory that are

00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,400
allowing you to explore the data much

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,870
faster and the faster you can understand

00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,339
your data the faster you can actually

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,170
come up with the plans for how you're

00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:06,570
going to put into your frameworks and do

00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,130
the training in your models pipeline it

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,360
seems like those feedback as well you

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,310
know the example you're giving earlier

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,370
about customer service yes or if you've

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,540
got some kind of AI augmentation the the

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,520
automation needs to be able to work up

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,830
faster as well the future is that there

00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,810
will be constant queries hitting fast

00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,040
databases that all the time coming up

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,620
with suggestions for us to do things

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,779
once once we get to understanding how we

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,190
want the process to go and I believe we

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,440
will change a lot of business processes

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:32,790
because business processes today and the

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,640
enterprise especially they're based on

00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,850
workarounds we've had yeah anytime we

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,080
have a technology challenge you know or

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,839
takes a while to do it what do we do we

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,880
do workarounds we do sampling of data we

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,980
give down sampling of data or we do you

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,630
know pre aggregation of data and then we

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,580
come up with we convince ourselves that

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,200
we're directionally correct of course

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,089
statistically we could justify this

00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,920
and that doesn't discover the outliers

00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,380
that doesn't discover the new thing so

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,940
this new approach that we have fast

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,980
access to the data that we have query

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,660
upon that data and we have a is new

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,670
query when that data is really gonna be

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,230
game-changing interesting in terms of

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,959
businesses sounds like a classic kind of

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,029
y:real scenario where you've got data

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,680
coming in up you've got a is operating

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,750
on it but then you're also gaining more

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,060
and more metadata about that absolutely

00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,980
and think about then what you do is

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,050
train these smart applications using

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,160
deep learning and put it at the edge you

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,750
don't even need to capture the data

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,370
anymore you know we already we don't

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,230
capture 93% of the data at the edge

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,089
anyway sure but with smart applications

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,660
at the edge it's going to be the rebirth

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,790
of IOT

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,860
I mean IOT has been great connecting

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,360
devices but having smart applications

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,130
that can analyze and make decisions on

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,200
that data is really what we need to do

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,910
we'll never be able to capture it but it

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,250
was that makes sense I mean looking at

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,020
say airline just even want to train the

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,730
turbines in flight yep I understand

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,320
that's about 12x by today that's a

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,850
breeze there's no way but and with this

00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,980
you could actually capture the

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,450
quintessential part you you'll know on

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,920
there whether there's actually a problem

00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,290
instead of waiting to actually capture

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,720
the day of do the analysis if I could

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,209
actually monitor everything from you

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,790
know wind turbines to drill bits on oil

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,880
rigs to airplane engines to the flap

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,170
wings and know how they're reacting it's

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,459
going to change a lot it's also going to

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,980
change many of the sensors we do

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,510
interesting you know so we may just find

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,790
that the sensors that we've put in place

00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,620
to capture all this data the wrong

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,300
sensors and we may actually want new

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,680
types of data because we now know what

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,660
we can do with it interesting so

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,839
refactoring putting more smarts into the

00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,459
sense of exactly smart applications next

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,060
to the sensors so they're making the

00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:34,709
decisions that way contract I'm really

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,079
interested in the data management part

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:39,870
about using GPUs for instance to make

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,860
access to data much faster and how what

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,660
kind of bearing that would have saying

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,579
the lives of practicing data scientists

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,959
yeah so what kind of vendors are out

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,270
there what kind of use cases can you

00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:50,089
describe that again so I mean first why

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:54,329
why are we seeing more gpu-based

00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:55,500
databases and data management I mean for

00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:57,480
years and years and years we've seen

00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,339
Dennard scaling and Moore's Law pay off

00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,930
for us right but we all starting to see

00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,579
a plateauing of that just because of the

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,800
physics of semiconductor you can't

00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,720
actually fit more transistors into that

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,029
power envelope so we've discovered by

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,920
finding parallelism in that and then

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,779
trying to give you that component you

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,310
could actually have databases take

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,140
advantage of that and Nvidia started

00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,240
this in 2008 when we launched our CUDA

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,040
so a couple of database companies have

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,240
been around for at least three to four

00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,650
years doing this on the smaller

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,290
standpoint some came out of government

00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,660
some came out of other areas companies

00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,620
like Matt B Connecticut there's a new

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,540
one called blazing dB

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,360
and their whole focus is using that

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,680
ability to offload what was just you

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,450
know the sequential capabilities on the

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,330
CPU to GPU and they're getting

00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,400
incredible processing power companies

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,960
like Verizon are using them for actually

00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,180
monitoring what's going through the SIM

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,670
card updates so if you if you do

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,170
upgrades to your entire network and you

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,940
have to wait several hours as hey let's

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,230
say that when it's not it's not the best

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,240
customer service that you want so

00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:56,589
they're they're seeing that the Postal

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,810
Service's has used it for actually

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:00,010
tracking where the where their trucks

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,740
ours and then deliberate but they never

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,150
see things more in real time and I say

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,950
real time but actually try to encourage

00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,460
people to stop seeing real time or what

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,230
do you prefer

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,150
a sub second okay we should because

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,950
let's call it what it really is we real

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,540
time you know as we walk around our

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:15,310
trade shows exception real-time could

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,170
meet anything from you know ten seconds

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,110
to a minute to ever change yes exactly

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,250
so and near real-time is another one

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,980
that's actually I don't know what that I

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,080
do go out for lunch excellent so but sub

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,210
second is really that's the speed of

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,839
thought if I can get a query done at the

00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,850
speed of thought

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,430
then I explore and I interact with data

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,670
in a much different way if I and so

00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,320
along with IOT then speed of thought sub

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,150
second we're talking about really

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,650
streaming applications I or what I can't

00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,570
exactly look like that yeah so you're

00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,760
capturing stream data and you can query

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,170
it so and there's great technologies I

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,550
mean people have been using Kafka four

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,320
years for capturing the data great so

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,820
that's a great technology I think it

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,529
will continue to do great things at

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,330
capturing it but if you can get into a

00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:56,740
database that I can only not only query

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,050
it in sub second time I can actually

00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,910
visualize it and find the correlations

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,920
between it I think a lot of the graph

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,470
activity so there's a company call out

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,620
of Berkeley called graphics tree it

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,540
allows you to see in a graph orientation

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,939
all the correlations between this amount

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,679
of data like context amount of data to

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:16,750
possibly do before in sub-second times

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,949
and people are using that and security a

00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,059
lot so if I could visualize all the ite

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,230
attacks or things that I've had from the

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:25,780
different IP address and all the

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,850
connections between them and see that I

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,250
can quickly figure out if there's any

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,360
outlying you know dangerous BOTS sitting

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,830
out there they're going to try to attack

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,830
my network when I'm not looking again

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,929
and so things like that or just

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,900
game-changing I like to think the best

00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:42,550
part of this is we're letting the

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,120
security areas we're letting the quants

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,440
role

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,790
these guys they get to go home earlier

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,559
tonight because of these technologies

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,059
they're not to stay up all night chasing

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,200
and finding these things that you can

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:52,540
actually go home and have a good dinner

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,100
and all those various inventions have

00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,010
changed so dramatically and you see

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,780
security issues everyday identities yeah

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,400
we have we need to address it and

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,290
security I mean I think deep learning

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,760
and AI will solve security right now

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,750
we're using it we're using a lot of

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,070
these fast technologies for

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,620
understanding what's going on and

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,750
understand the data but there it's going

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,430
to come back to traffic patterns and

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,260
understanding them and then discovering

00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:16,750
the anomalies and discovering the

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,500
approaches to solve those it's not that

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:22,870
different than the game of go and the

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,250
the champion losing to the computer

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,530
because the computer was able to study

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,330
every pattern that ever existed in the

00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,679
game and they say there's more moves in

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,990
that game than there are atoms in the

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,220
universe I don't I was sure or not but

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,350
there's a lot of moves and different

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,610
options so I think it's it's the exact

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,000
same thing a lot of patterns and

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,429
enterprise and traffic wonderful so for

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,950
the person who's in that kind of role

00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:47,830
who is a security researcher their data

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,230
scientist their network engineer what's

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,240
what's your advice for being able to

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,070
level up you really get in the game with

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,040
AI yeah I think first thing is you have

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,390
to collect your data and amazed how many

00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,980
times I talk to someone and say oh

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,330
actually we use a service and we don't

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,370
have access to our data make sure you

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:04,570
have access to the logs and and start

00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,190
going through also now once you have the

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,990
logs you can use some of these tools for

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,120
exploring it right understanding what

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,309
the logs are going on being able to

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,170
visualize it find the correlations but

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:16,690
then you should also start ladling like

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:19,320
those logs in a way and then training I

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:21,580
would spin up a small framework

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,620
understanding it and start just trading

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,809
my traffic patterns understanding it so

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,910
that I can then have an inference and

00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:30,130
deployment to study when something

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,110
breaks from that interest and just that

00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,450
that's a pretty basic level that will

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,820
allow me to start going about it for

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,670
endpoints there are things like deep

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:42,130
instinct silence would help as well I

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,270
expect to see startups coming to spaces

00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,220
so a lot of these things people are

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,110
doing I expect to see packaged

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,790
application doing this more and more I

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,230
mean there's you know how many six

00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,410
thousand startups being funded right now

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,760
we work we have an inception program we

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,130
work with a lot of startups we have well

00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,680
over

00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,080
1,500 closing on 2,000 that are working

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,390
on it all in AI all doing incredible

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,700
things and that kind of focus to is a

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,980
lot about discovery of again getting

00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,900
back to domain-specific the knowledge

00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,940
about your particular area where your

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,560
business handled exactly interesting

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,260
what about other things that people

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,880
would need to have in there in a toolkit

00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,620
do they need to learn more about the

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,650
hardware it's just more in the software

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:24,140
where's the you know it's actually an

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,400
all good in new computing platforms that

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,500
come along it's the hardware plus the

00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,840
software obviously we're seeing more

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,330
compute power than we've ever had before

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,850
right I mean so we are literally you

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,380
know you know in a land of Marx law

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,630
squared in a lot of ways because it's

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,160
just so much capacity which is needed

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,690
I mean we're throwing so much data at

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,150
this we have to process it in parallel

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,070
so we're driving down the autobahn of

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,660
you know a 10,000 lane highway instead

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,670
of a country road event trying to

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,500
process at all so I think the hardware

00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,590
is becoming more and more prevalent I

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,660
see you know every major cloud provider

00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,790
you can get this level of you know the

00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,130
GPU computing Nvidia computing is

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,990
available there but also it is the

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,880
software so we spent a lot of time

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,590
working with every major framework

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,290
optimizing and turning it and

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:11,240
integrating it and honestly putting it

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,160
in containers so that you don't have to

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,460
do all that integration so if I want to

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,650
run it on my you know PC with a Titan X

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,150
and get the acceleration there if I want

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,460
to run it on a workstation you know

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,530
which is the equivalent of like 400 CPUs

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,260
in a whisper quiet box right right next

00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,460
my you know desk which is unthought-of

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,510
you know who would have who would have

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,720
thought we could have done that like

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,790
five years ago let alone you know ten

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,950
years ago but and then or move it to a

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,210
data center or move it to a cloud I can

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,160
use the exact same software in a

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,960
containerized component which which is

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,810
essential because we need do the

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,090
training where the data is right because

00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,790
it is kind of a lot there's a lot of

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:51,620
data and move it around is difficult

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,360
right and then when you want to do the

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,890
inferencing or the deployment that also

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,570
has to be where the data is coming in to

00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,330
make the decisions right I mean we don't

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,920
train self-driving autonomous driving

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,180
vehicles to have them sit in your garage

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,400
right there out in the world

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,120
experiencing and doing the data and they

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,100
have to be able to

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,660
it out there in the real world same in

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,180
the enterprise same and everything we do

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,800
so more contextual learning it's more

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,420
contextual learning and you have to be

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,309
able to know where you're at and that

00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,990
that's probably the last thing I think

00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:19,910
is actually really exciting is going on

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,070
we keep thinking about or what if we

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,770
don't have the data or more more of a

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,830
you simulation augmented reality meets

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,870
deep learning is really opening up doors

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,910
for so many thing and it's happening in

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,040
manufacturing now it has to happen well

00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,780
think about the robots today like we can

00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,130
train Pickers right you know they pick

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,230
something off the line put it in the box

00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,940
over here but now think about when that

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,520
picker is going to be picking up a car

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,070
or moving something that weighs two tons

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,260
or three tons you don't really want to

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,300
experiment with that robot in the real

00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,250
world because something's picking up two

00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,720
tons you know you could knock down the

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,760
building by accident you know and in the

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,670
learning process so more and more we're

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,040
seeing these being trained in you know

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,470
another universe an augmented reality

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,480
and a virtual reality and then you take

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,120
the brain that you train that way and

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,010
you put it in the physical world so it's

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,900
that's a that's something that's going

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,340
to be really central same same in

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,490
autonomous driving vehicles that we work

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:19,250
a lot in you can't find every road or

00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,110
every situation so at some point it

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,090
makes sense to use the you know the

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:25,610
gaming approach you know the simulation

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,860
approach to you know how like in flying

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,020
everywhere every possible scenario and

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,910
of course I can build on a huge industry

00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,380
in gaming yeah and well yeah well that

00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,059
already is I mean we're already seeing

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,590
people love the idea of creating that

00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,690
next scene by letting it just you know

00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,400
doing the transfer right going from

00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,020
there and I think that's that you're

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,640
mentioning earlier the transfer learning

00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,860
is absolutely important there because

00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,590
eventually you know as we do all this

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,570
work the automobile guys or whether it's

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,400
you know even the enterprise guys you

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,320
have your own data you know si P can

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,000
create a model but eventually they're

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,030
going to use transfer capabilities that

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,650
the enterprise itself has their own data

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,720
that they want to augment that

00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:06,110
intelligence level of that framework of

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,670
that solution and do it we know that all

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,350
the automobile makers are going to do

00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:11,120
the exact same thing so that's what's

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,010
exciting when we talk about a solution

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,280
and it applies across five or six

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,380
different industries I think so too

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,780
put this into a kind of a landscape of

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,420
an architecture for enterprises are

00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,940
embracing AI you know we talked about

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,680
needing to have three components that

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,440
they compute at the big data and the big

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,610
models and so that's exactly what you're

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,190
just going out there they've got they

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,810
compute from the hardware and your

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,950
trigger to compute the bigger the model

00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,910
compete which is the bigger the

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,260
knowledge you're going to get out of it

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,700
yeah I'm going to have the data and you

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,950
need the data the data is elated less if

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,280
you don't have the data I mean we train

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:47,780
on paper we get paper right yeah well

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,450
thank Jim I'm looking forward to your

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,130
keynote so we're gonna have artificial

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,840
intelligence conference in New York

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:57,220
coming up now it should be a lot of fun

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,220
