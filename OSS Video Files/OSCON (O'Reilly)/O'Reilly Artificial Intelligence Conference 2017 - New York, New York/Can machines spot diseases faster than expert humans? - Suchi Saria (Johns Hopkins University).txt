	00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:10,690
so back in about 2013 we started

00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,240
investing in thinking about how do we

00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,950
take diseases like sepsis which are

00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,430
really hard to diagnose and that

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,529
timeliness is very important and can we

00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,050
teach machines how to spot these

00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:24,970
diseases now before I start diving into

00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:27,849
how we did it for sepsis let me give you

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:31,210
a really simple example especially if

00:00:27,849 --> 00:00:32,950
you know you're sort of getting new

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:35,260
you're new to AI and thinking about how

00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,140
do these systems really work how do we

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,290
teach machines how to do something so

00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,150
this is a cartoonish representation of

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,280
it but I'd say pretty accurate in terms

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,380
of the key ideas you have to think about

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,210
so the first thing you're trying to do

00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,190
let's imagine you're trying to teach a

00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,320
machine how to walk something simple and

00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,330
actually turns our teaching machine how

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,670
to walk is really hard but let's say

00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:59,080
you're teaching them how to walk now the

00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,240
first thing you have to do is to define

00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,190
your goal right so you have to the goal

00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,530
here is to learn how to walk and you

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,170
want to define the goal in a language

00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,570
the computer or the machine or the robot

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,970
understand and so for that we use

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,590
mathematics and here what we would

00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,140
define is called an objective function

00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:20,740
so this objective function will allow

00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:23,440
you to and now effectively the Machine

00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,690
goal is to optimize this objective

00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,520
function now the next thing it does is

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,280
effectively it needs to find a strategy

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,140
or a sequence of moves in order to be

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,540
able to learn how to walk so in this

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,670
context what it means is one way to

00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,130
uncover the right sequence or right

00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,860
strategy is to experiment so the robot

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,260
proposes a move the move gets scored and

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,940
if it's a move that helps you walk it

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,470
gets a positive score if it's a move

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,840
that doesn't help you walk it gets a

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,630
negative score and effectively it builds

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,869
on what helps it work and continues to

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:58,150
experiment so effectively this is the

00:01:55,869 --> 00:02:01,840
strategy of what people describe as

00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:04,869
reinforcement learning now one week and

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,330
so now in our situation if we could

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:09,759
experiment with the patient we could

00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,410
learn using the strategy the challenges

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,590
we don't want to be experimenting with

00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,500
patients but akin to this instead of

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,790
experiment on the patients what

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
chronic health records give us

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,640
effectively retrospective data where you

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,460
have hundreds of other patients and you

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,980
can identify individuals like this

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,820
patient and learn from that so it's as

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,130
though somebody EHR is storing a lot of

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,960
data as though somebody had done these

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,760
experiments these are live experiments

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,530
you have millions of those experiments

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,480
and from those experiments effectively

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,700
we're going to follow the same strategy

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,700
