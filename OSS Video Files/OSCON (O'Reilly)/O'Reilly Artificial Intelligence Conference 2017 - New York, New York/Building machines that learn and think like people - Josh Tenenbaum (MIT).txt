you know in the second part I want to

00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:08,910
turn to talking about common sense and

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,440
understanding and to get a sense of this

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,969
look at these scenes here and again

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,740
we're just like you saw in the last talk

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,719
we're going back to childhood here I

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,730
think you can study everything you need

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,050
to understand intelligence not in

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,419
kindergarten but actually even before

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,040
you get to preschool current machine

00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:24,509
vision systems at best when they look at

00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,710
seems like this might understand in

00:00:24,509 --> 00:00:26,849
these terms they might be able to tell

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,800
you that there's a child playing with

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,149
blocks in fact at least the best

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,500
publicly available state of the art

00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,570
caption system say something more like

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,810
this a child sitting on the table a

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,190
child in the room but regardless think

00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,750
about how much you would need to go

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,700
beyond any one of these linguistic

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,750
descriptions to really make sense of

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,030
what's going on here if you were this

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,770
child right you'd have to go way beyond

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,420
this you'd have to you have to do what

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,460
we call intuitive physics and intuitive

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,560
psychology you'd have to perceive all

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,270
the 3d objects their their sizes and

00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,829
shapes and where they are their physical

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,390
properties at least enough to be able to

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,890
pick them up you have to understand

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,480
something about the physics of gravity

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,130
and support to be able to build a stable

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,899
tower you have to understand something

00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,159
about the goals what's inside the other

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,710
minds of the other kids you're playing

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,049
with I think you can see this most

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,909
dramatically in what by now is a video

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:13,560
from a classic experiment done about ten

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,170
years ago by the developmental

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,939
psychologist Wernick and in Tomasello

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,859
watch this video here it's from an

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,170
experiment on spontaneous helping

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,719
behavior in 18-month old one and a half

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,859
year olds the experimenter is the big

00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,189
guy Felix

00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,619
okay the subject in the experiment is

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,579
the little kid who's watching and he

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,200
doesn't know what's going on anymore

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,630
than you do but think about what's going

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,189
on inside his head he sees Felix banging

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,810
against the cabinet it looks like he

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,560
needs help how do we know that we'll

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,560
watch what the kid does

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,979
okay you got it now the key yet good the

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,170
kid is the one who deserves the applause

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,360
here's the key moment when he looks back

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,009
he looks up at the guy then he looks

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,649
down at the hands and tracks the rest of

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,840
his motion okay that shows you that he's

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,460
thinking did I get what you what you

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,600
were trying to do did I do the right

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,390
thing did I help you

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,099
let me see okay that that's that's the

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,720
heart of intelligence right there and I

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,970
think this is a grand challenge for AI

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,290
not just causing the science if we could

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,420
reverse engineer what's going on inside

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,280
that kids mind just think of what we

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,269
could do with robots and other machines

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,269
