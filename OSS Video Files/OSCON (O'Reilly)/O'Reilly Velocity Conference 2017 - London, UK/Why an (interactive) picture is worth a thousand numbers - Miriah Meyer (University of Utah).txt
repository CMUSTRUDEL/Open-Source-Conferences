Title: Why an (interactive) picture is worth a thousand numbers - Miriah Meyer (University of Utah)
Publication date: 2017-10-20
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - London, UK
Description: 
	Feeling overwhelmed by huge amounts of data has become the norm. Creating effective visual representations of data offloads some of the work of quickly finding interesting patterns to our powerful perceptual system. Miriah Meyer explores the role that interactive visualizations can play in helping us find meaning in mounds of data and discusses the limitations of this approach.

	00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,609
how do you compare the human and lizard

00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,760
genomes

00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:12,249
well my collaborator Manfred grep hare

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,289
was tackling this challenge in order to

00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:18,100
better understand how our genome encodes

00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:20,380
who we are when I first started working

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,900
with Manfred he was using off-the-shelf

00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,330
visualizations like this dot plot so

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,670
what we're looking at here is one human

00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,130
chromosome compared against one

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,779
chromosome from that of the lizard and

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,970
then each one of the dots inside this

00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:36,700
plot represents a region of sequence

00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,370
similarity between those two genomes so

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,300
the ATC's and G's roughly looked the

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,039
same in these two chromosomes but from

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,020
Manfred to look across his full data set

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,910
he had to look at many of these plots

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,820
and in fact one of his data sets was

00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,500
producing over 300 of them when I asked

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,840
him about these he said that he found

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,090
them really really overwhelming and also

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,500
on intuitive and it turned out in

00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,660
hindsight that they were hiding some

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,690
critical subtleties in his computational

00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,490
results so he worked together for a

00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,619
while and I designed a new tool for him

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,290
called Ms B and here I'm showing you a

00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:13,450
view from just one part of that tool and

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,110
Ms B is designed to support data like

00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,909
Manfred's

00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,009
data that's complex that's

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,240
multi-dimensional and was the first tool

00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,210
to fully support this type of

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,040
comparative genomics data what we're

00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,479
looking at in the outer ring are all the

00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,240
chromosomes from that of the human

00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,640
genome and on the inner ring all the

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,590
chromosomes from that of the lizard

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,750
along with one user-selected chromosome

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,090
from that outer ring that is emanating a

00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,649
set of colored lines and each one of

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,659
those lines represents a region of

00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,290
sequence similarity between those two

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:46,329
genomes so using MS be a scientist can

00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,369
quickly through interaction explore

00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:49,840
their full data set in order to build up

00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:55,509
mental models about the interesting

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,820
patterns that are contained therein this

00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,710
is actually a screenshot of the very

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,350
first data set that Manfred loaded into

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,479
MS B now by some measures this is a

00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,969
pretty picture there's lots of colors

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,190
and they're circles and it's amazing how

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:11,710
much everyone loves circles but for

00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,800
Manfred what he saw was really ugly

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,480
messy data he was

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,220
expecting there to be so many lines

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,650
going to so many different places and

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,350
this actually went against what he knew

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,150
to be biologically true so he went back

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,650
to his model and he tweaked parameters

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,890
for a while and was able to get to this

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,300
point so when he got here he completed

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,400
he decided to take a different approach

00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,560
and completely scrapped the model he was

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,710
working on and designed a new one and

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,690
that model gave him this data set so he

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,950
then went on to publish his results and

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,440
release his software to the scientific

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,000
community and I asked him afterwards

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,100
how long it would have taken him to make

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,650
this breakthrough using the tools he had

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,720
available to him prior to Ms B and what

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,450
he told me was honestly I don't think I

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,730
would ever have gotten here and what I

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,190
like about this story is that not only

00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,930
does it illustrate how visualization can

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,030
be effective in helping someone make

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,650
sense of data but it also shows

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,440
visualization what I think is at its

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,360
finest when it can disrupt and and

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,650
fundamentally change the way that we're

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,980
thinking about our questions to begin

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,980
with

00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,830
