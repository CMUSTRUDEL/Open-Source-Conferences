when we talk about asking people we're

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,490
really talking about is this we're

00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:11,660
talking about large-scale coordination

00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:13,549
free distributed systems but beyond this

00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,029
even beyond this I think like the term

00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:20,689
edge compute is also a misnomer all

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,640
right so there's this guy John gage he

00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:25,460
was formerly the chief scientist at Sun

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,529
Microsystems you know may they rest in

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,419
peace

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:31,970
he was also fun fact a former member of

00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:34,340
Richard Nixon's enemies list in late the

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,370
1970s totally irrelevant to the story

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,840
but anyway but what he was saying he had

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,730
this like really amazing quote they

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,199
actually become like a became a thing

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,940
that Sun Microsystems talked about for a

00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:47,120
long time which was the network is the

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,829
computer right what he was talking about

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,809
there as the compounding effects of

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:54,079
having networked computers and humans

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,879
working simultaneously right but I think

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,600
it also applies to this thing of that we

00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,500
talked about with edge compute so my

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,140
question is like where does your

00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,449
application live right some of you might

00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,490
say okay my application lives in AWS

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:09,080
others might say oh I'm actually a

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,210
mobile developer my application lives on

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,160
the phone or maybe you're like a video

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,280
developer my application lives in the

00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,270
browser in the video player right the

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,740
thing is though that like your

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,960
application doesn't live in a single

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,460
place and it's not a single thing right

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,930
your application is actually more like a

00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,640
tree if you look at the like the root as

00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:32,500
the origin all the way outs like the

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,460
devices as the leaves of this tree so

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,200
even if you're like not actually

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,120
intending to build a distributed system

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,730
that is in fact what you are typically

00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,030
doing right

00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,160
I mean why why is that the case right so

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,170
we certainly like in most applications

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,120
at this point we have certain logic that

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,740
runs at the origin we have certain logic

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,600
that runs the device why do we do that

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,330
because certain things are more

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,940
efficient or only possible at certain

00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:02,120
parts of this like network tree right

00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,800
like we could in fact render every frame

00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,390
of an iOS app on the server and just

00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,190
like you know display it there but

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,200
that's totally silly why would you do

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,019
that it's much more efficient to just do

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,090
the display in iOS likewise you could

00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,430
store all of every users data on every

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,079
users phone however that's really not

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,489
clearly not what you actually want to do

00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,989
right so there are certain places in

00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,530
this network where certain things are

00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,670
more efficient and more reasonable but

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,079
when we talk about this we always talk

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,000
about it as like oh you know we do

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,620
things at the device we do things at the

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,700
origin but there's more steps in there

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:39,079
right no there we go right so if you're

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,489
using fastly if you're using some other

00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,200
like maybe you're using Amazon like

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:44,359
lambda or something like that right

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,239
there are more steps between your origin

00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:50,269
and your device than just that one

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:52,220
network hop so it could go even further

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:55,400
than that right it could actually be all

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,379
sorts of things in between there what we

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,419
refer to as edge compute in my opinion

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,280
the way I look at it is actually more

00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:03,620
about pushing logic that was

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,459
traditionally done at this origin out to

00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,290
the branches and the leaves of this tree

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,689
but actually in in my opinion goes far

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,730
beyond like logic what we're actually

00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:15,709
talking about in these cases is autonomy

00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,900
which again Chris Michael John talked

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,169
about in a certain way in his talk

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,340
yesterday talking about the idea of

00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:24,409
different pieces of this network being

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:29,479
able to function without access to the

00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:31,159
other pieces so the other part of like

00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,359
edge compute that I feel like is missing

00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,489
that isn't really discussed all that

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,489
much at the moment but I feel like it's

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:38,900
actually like a big missing piece is

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,900
that no one really thinks about the fact

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,000
that the economics of computation change

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,579
depending on where and that network you

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,389
are where in that tree you are

00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:49,970
computation actually becomes more

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,120
expensive the further out from that

00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,430
origin you get like getting computation

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,060
power in Ashburn Virginia or in San Jose

00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,639
right

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,739
very easy very cheap getting it in like

00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,680
the data center that is like in that

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:06,049
local region in Bangladesh much harder

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,159
right much more expensive right so like

00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,290
I feel like the other part of this

00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,209
that's missing in addition to the new

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,569
languages the new frameworks everything

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,280
here is like an actual platform for

00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,940
building these like edge compute

00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,940
applications

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,139
