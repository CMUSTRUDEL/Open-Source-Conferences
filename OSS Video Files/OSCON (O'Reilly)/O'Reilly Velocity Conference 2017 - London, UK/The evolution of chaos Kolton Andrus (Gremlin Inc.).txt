Title: The evolution of chaos Kolton Andrus (Gremlin Inc.)
Publication date: 2017-10-20
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - London, UK
Description: 
	Chaos engineering is intentionally injecting failure into a system to proactively identify and fix problems before they cause outages. Itâ€™s an emerging discipline, but its roots are decades old. So why is it now becoming the go-to approach for building resilient systems? Why does the current state of distributed architectures require chaos as the best solution for system failure?

Kolton Andrus explores how chaos engineering has evolved into the discipline now practiced at leading cloud companies, how to begin your journey toward resilient systems, and how to make those pagers quit buzzing at 3:00am.

	00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,240
but first I want to give you my

00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,670
definition of what chaos engineering is

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,459
if you were to ask me in my opinion it's

00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:16,400
the thoughtful planned experiments

00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:19,700
designed to teach us about our system to

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,530
help us find the weak points now this

00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,380
has gone by a few other names in times

00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,600
past I grew up with the concept of

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,410
failure testing or disaster recovery

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:32,870
testing gamedays concepts that embody

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:36,380
this this principle but really it's been

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:40,820
given a name and a definition now so

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:42,350
what is chaos engineering the analogy

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,910
that I like to draw the one that I would

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,510
say I could explain to my grandma and

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:49,790
works well it's that of the vaccine

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,480
we're going to inject something harmful

00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,460
in order to build an immunity might be a

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,860
bit counterintuitive and often times

00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,719
when I talk to two companies or teams

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,969
that are looking into this the executive

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,430
response is a little bit withdrawn it's

00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,409
a little bit oh you want to do what but

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,389
I think that that bringing it home with

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,009
the vaccine helps us to relate it to

00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:12,619
things that were comfortable with two

00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:15,380
things that we understand but it's more

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:18,469
than just this concept of of hormesis

00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,979
this concept of of the vaccine it's an

00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:24,079
opportunity to do things proactively

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:25,549
most incident response most incident

00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,880
management that I've been part of is a

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:31,219
very reactive process after the incident

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,159
occurs you ask the five why's about what

00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:37,130
led to it you do the incident review you

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,880
do the the triage and and dive into why

00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,189
it happened

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,700
chaos engineering allows us to be

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,779
proactive to get in front of the problem

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,349
to think about what could go wrong

00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:50,149
before it blows up in our faces and then

00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,399
the last part that I think is key is

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,770
once we have understood these attributes

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,439
of our system once we validated that

00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,630
they behave the way we expect we want to

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,849
automate it so that we can prevent the

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,099
drift into failure systems will

00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,409
naturally due to the contentions within

00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:08,599
them come back into places that failure

00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:10,880
will reoccur or we'll see it again and

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,350
so by automating this we can help

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,510
prevent that or we can get some

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,130
forewarning when we've caused changes

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,130
that are going to result in trouble

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,110
okay so that's a little bit about what

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,280
chaos engineering is what isn't chaos

00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,350
engineering being a cowboy or a cowgirl

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,970
going out and just shooting stuff

00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,069
shooting servers and prod and seeing

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,130
what happens not telling anyone what

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,380
you're doing being reckless I think this

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,180
is the fear that a lot of people have

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,840
when they hear about chaos engineering

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,150
at first

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,670
oh we're gonna let someone with prod

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:52,310
access just go out and break stuff what

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:54,470
could go wrong so back to back to this

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,510
word okay this this term chaos

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,000
engineering it's an emerging discipline

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,800
it's a new concept but I think part of

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,319
what's really galvanized it and brought

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,790
it to being you know something that

00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,640
people are becoming more familiar with

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:10,580
is the name there's a great blog post by

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,380
Russ miles recently on dissecting the

00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,890
name and it got me thinking a bit about

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,350
it you know chaos it's it's exciting

00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,120
it's mischievous this is where people

00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,160
people's eyes light up when you tell

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,780
them hey you can go break things and

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,660
it's part of your job and you're doing

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,200
the right thing but at the same time

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,760
we've coupled it with engineering

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,920
we're being disciplined about it we're

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,400
being thoughtful we're we're approaching

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,640
it from a history of designing systems

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,829
in an intelligent way and so really I

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,140
think this combination is what is

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:47,780
allowing this to gain traction it

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,519
maintains that that mischievous impish

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,019
element but it combines it with

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,470
something a little bit more comfortable

00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:56,269
and know another thing that I'm noticed

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:59,390
while while thinking deeply about the

00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,670
name is the ordering matters I think

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,489
that chaos monkey for for all of the

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,980
greatness it's done has also caused a

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,930
little bit of confusion when I talk to

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,030
people about chaos engineering they

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,340
assume that I mean you have to randomly

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,950
cause failures for it to be effective

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,989
I actually disagree with that I think

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,930
the right place to start is again

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:23,750
thoughtful planned experiments and so

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,970
really perhaps this is backwards what we

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,970
really want to do is engineer for the

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,230
chaos in our systems we may choose to

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,750
yield chaos

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,470
tool to accomplish that but that is not

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,470
the only way

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,660
