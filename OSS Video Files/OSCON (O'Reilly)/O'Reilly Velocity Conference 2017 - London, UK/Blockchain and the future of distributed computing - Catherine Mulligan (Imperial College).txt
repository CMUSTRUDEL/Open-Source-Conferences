Title: Blockchain and the future of distributed computing - Catherine Mulligan (Imperial College)
Publication date: 2017-10-20
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - London, UK
Description: 
	The blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) have drawn considerable attention due to their potential to disrupt traditional business processes. From a very simplistic perspective, a blockchain allows untrusting parties with common interests to cocreate a permanent, unchangeable, and transparent record of exchange and processing. The technology has now moved far beyond its origins in bitcoin; multiple commercial organizations, industrial bodies, and governments are now investigating how to apply these technologies not just to reduce costs but also to remove friction from internal and external markets for both data and security.

Although the blockchain is technically a distributed system, there has been a surprising lack interest from the distributed systems community. Catherine Mulligan explores the implications of the blockchain to distributed systems and explains what needs to be addressed in order to build and maintain them effectively.

so blockchain how many of you have heard

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,830
of blockchain quite a few okay great so

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,539
this is going to be a very brief

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,119
overview of what blockchain is and what

00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:18,090
it actually means for distributed

00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,700
systems so if we think about blockchain

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,590
it's a lot about removing the need for

00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,750
intermediaries a lot of people think

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,869
that it can remove for example central

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,820
banks and things like that so if we

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,710
think about it previous generations of

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,199
digital technologies have been about the

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,309
exchange of data and information and how

00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:39,809
we can do that faster and more securely

00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:41,579
so in a process that's been going on in

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,289
the world since the nineteen sixties as

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,079
I'm sure you're all very aware we've had

00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:48,269
the IT inside everything revolution

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,639
we've had mobile and we've got now the

00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,420
IOT revolution ongoing as well where

00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:56,249
we're putting sensors into everything so

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,199
blockchain really is just another part

00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:00,059
of that digital disruption evolution

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,179
however it gives us something really

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,339
unique blockchain is about the exchange

00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,560
of value it's about how you exchange

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,110
assets with one another and what that

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,630
means is instant decentralized ensued

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,600
anonymous value transfer is now possible

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,820
and that is a huge change in the way

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,039
that we can construct applications on

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,600
the Internet

00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:23,969
so traditionally within our society we

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,250
here have trust created through

00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,710
intermediaries for example the central

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,869
bank so Bitcoin obviously is intended to

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,670
replace the central bank but we also

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,100
have a lot of other sort of

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,070
intermediaries lawyers for example

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,289
create contracts between companies we

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,920
have real estate agents and another

00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:46,979
aspect is the firm itself so the company

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,770
is acts as an aggregator of human

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,100
resources capital and financing

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,439
basically so the idea here is can we

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,439
remove these intermediaries and replace

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,109
them with the decentralized and

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,109
digitalized form of trust so blockchain

00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,670
is very worrying to lawyers for example

00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:08,369
we have many people coming into our

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,200
Center basically very worried the

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,540
blockchain changes their business model

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,550
from being a charge per hour to a charge

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,290
per item which means they start to not

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,650
really earn so much money so they're

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,450
very

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,780
read about that which is why I kind of

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,569
like this technology so let's have a

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,209
very brief overview of blockchain what

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:29,760
is it effectively from a very simple

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,430
perspective it allows untrusting parties

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,829
with interests shared interests to

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,720
co-create a permanent unchangeable and

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,519
transparent record of exchange and

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,730
processing without relying on a third

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,950
party so one thing to note here is the

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,530
term blockchain and distributed ledger

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,359
they're often used interchangeably but

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,959
they're not always the same thing

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:53,430
so who's heard of distributed Ledger's

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,370
okay it's less than blockchain that's

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,400
quite interesting okay so there are a

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,650
wide range of distributed Ledger's we

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,040
can see here we talk about three

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,349
different archetypes really so on the

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,480
right you can see we have commissioned

00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:11,939
private and shared systems and on the

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,090
far left we have permissionless public

00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,340
shared systems so permissionless public

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,319
shared systems means that everybody can

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,599
become a node on the network everyone

00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,280
can write to the network and everyone

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,109
can read every transaction on the

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,819
network so even if you're not a member

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,349
of the network you can see every

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,500
transaction that's ever been made on the

00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:34,949
blockchain for Bitcoin for example we

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,579
see here aetherium and Bitcoin but we

00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,019
also have something called the private

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,109
permissions private shared systems and

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,970
an example of that is the hyper ledger

00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:47,510
initiative from the Linux Foundation

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:50,280
what that means is you are whitelisted

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:53,099
to become a member of the network and

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,479
you have to have permissions as well in

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:56,970
order to be able to read the

00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,940
transactions a key aspect of this kind

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,919
of system is that you can actually form

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,859
private channels between different

00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,739
parties when it's necessary we also have

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,750
a hybrid in the middle which is usually

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,879
permissions public shared systems and

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,989
those are very useful for example when

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,479
you're talking about regulatory

00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,310
environments so let's say you're in the

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,430
insurance industry and you wish to

00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,049
create a shared ledger to exchange

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,360
information around insurance

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,060
transactions you would always want the

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,800
regulator to be able to have access to

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,090
that information but not necessarily

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,310
read and write from it

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,169
would be up sorry not right to it they

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,050
would be able to read it and the reason

00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:38,940
for that is regulatory requirements so

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,770
the idea is there they would like to

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,080
make sure there's no collusion and that

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,520
there's no cartel formation so those are

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,520
