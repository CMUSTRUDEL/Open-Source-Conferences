How does your system perform under load? What are the bottlenecks? How does the system fail at its limits? And, more importantly, how do you stay ahead as your system evolves and its workload grows?

Kavya Joshi shares strategies to prepare systems for flux and scale. Drawing from a range of use cases, including Facebook’s Kraken, which provides shadow traffic, and Samsara’s custom load simulator, Kavya demonstrates how to improve your understanding of your systems as they run today and plan for how they’ll run tomorrow.
