Title: Biological computation Sara-Jane Dunn (Microsoft Research)
Publication date: 2017-10-20
Playlist: O'Reilly Velocity Conference 2017 - London, UK
Description: 
	Sara-Jane Dunn discusses an entirely different paradigm of computing: the information-processing carried out by cells. Focusing on examples from cutting-edge stem cell research, Sara shares formal techniques from computer science that allow us to peer into the inner workings of biology, make sense of the earliest stages of development, and even program cells for use in therapy.

so if we think about it the ability to

00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:09,400
rob blood reliably and robustly program

00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:11,830
biology could transform health and

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,049
medicine through allowing us to generate

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,879
programmable molecular scale devices

00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:19,240
that could detect and respond to

00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,820
infection inside your body could allow

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,919
us to transform how we feed an

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,929
ever-growing population in the midst of

00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:27,789
climate change through allowing us to

00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:32,200
program plants to be resistant to

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:34,320
drought or fungal infection the ability

00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,370
to program biology could even

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,410
revolutionize how we power an

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,270
increasingly energy greedy planet

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,430
through the generation of artificial

00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:46,660
fuels or even something like artificial

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:48,789
photosynthesis now I'm often asked you

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:52,149
know why is Microsoft interested in

00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:53,620
biology and I think that it's it's

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,359
fairly obvious to me because given that

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,519
Microsoft was at the forefront of the

00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,440
very first software revolution it makes

00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:01,449
sense that it be at the forefront of the

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,280
next software revolution which I would

00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:05,680
think of as being the living software

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,480
revolution and just as we couldn't

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,400
imagine 50 years ago the kinds of

00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,230
technologies and companies that would

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,360
emerge from programming on silicon I

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,130
don't think now we'd be able to imagine

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,210
what we could do with being able to

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:22,540
program biology and it's not such a

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,890
crazy idea okay so like the computers

00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,740
and phones and everything that we're

00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,960
using every day cells themselves perform

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,360
computation all in all I mean is they

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,180
process information that's how cells

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,030
make the decisions to divide or die or

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,980
grow or move but cells don't run on

00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,110
transistors that are made out of silicon

00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,140
they have to use their biochemistry to

00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:45,640
execute their programs and they take in

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,500
different types of information they use

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,680
mechanical information electrical

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,990
information and chemical information but

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,640
unfortunately understanding biological

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,500
computation is really not that simple

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,570
and that's not least because it bears

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,340
almost no resemblance to the silicon

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,670
based computation we're so familiar with

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:06,480
if we think about it in contrast to

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,890
engineered systems living systems

00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,519
self-generate so what I'm showing here

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,760
is an example of mitosis the stages that

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,520
cells go through as they divide unlike

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,370
engineered

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,660
systems biological systems

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,430
self-organized so what you're seeing

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,410
here is an image of a developing mouse

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,950
embryo and you can start to see some

00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,320
familiar structures emerging unlike

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,500
engineered systems biological systems

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,070
self-repair this is an example of blood

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,960
clot forming over a wound

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,090
unlike engineered systems biological

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,400
systems have two cents and actuate at

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,530
molecular scales and those molecular

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,510
level interactions lead to macro scale

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,430
output in the form of intelligence or

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,220
memory or emotion and what I'm showing

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:53,660
here is a real neural network that's

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,560
some neurons forming a network in the

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,930
brain and unlike engineered system cells

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,120
have to undertake massively parallel

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,880
operations with slow and noisy

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,490
components in a really noisy environment

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,500
what this image shows is a rendering of

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,360
the cellular landscape so you can see

00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,140
how tightly packed the mitochondria the

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,780
proteins and everything are in the cell

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,850
and perhaps most intriguingly unlike

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,340
engineered systems biological systems

00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:25,220
blur the line between software and

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,200
hardware during development the software

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,520
is responsible for producing and

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,890
assembling the hardware which is the

00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,870
organism but throughout that process the

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,330
developing organism itself has to run

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,250
that program so in other words the

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,230
hardware generates the software sorry

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,150
the hardware runs the software while the

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,540
software simultaneously generates the

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,540
