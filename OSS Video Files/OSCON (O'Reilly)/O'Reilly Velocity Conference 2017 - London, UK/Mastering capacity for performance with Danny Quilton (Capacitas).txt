I'm Nikki McDonald content director -

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,440
Riley media and I'm here today with

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:11,130
Danny quilton CTO and founder co-founder

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,920
of capaci toss hi Danny how are you hey

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,800
hey good good thanks okay so you've been

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,590
around your company has for 15 years how

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,529
in that time has software changed to the

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,580
building and managing of it um I think

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,619
both - two things really I think first

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,140
adoption of the cloud that's made a huge

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,040
difference to us in the realm of

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,219
capacity planning and secondly delivery

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,350
methods for delivering software so the

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,379
adoption of agile and these continuous

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,289
methods has had a pronounced effect on

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,120
how we manage performance for those

00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:49,920
software deliveries so what are the

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,230
challenges you can experience working

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,969
with the continuous delivery methods I

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,690
think there's a number of different

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,969
challenges there first off you know with

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,430
we're talking one of our guys is having

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,119
a talk tomorrow with John pillar head of

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:09,000
software engineering it's Arcadia and

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,530
John totally buys into performance and

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,900
understands the need of it but he says

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,509
you know in in my continuous world you

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,430
guys can't slow us down so that's that's

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,810
the first thing anything we do mustn't

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,060
slow down the rate of delivery

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:27,540
secondly the the other thing which is a

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,860
challenge is the test windows we have so

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,020
when we're doing performance testing

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,729
their continuous context we have very

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,950
small windows in which to run those

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,320
tests we in the old days we had the

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,320
luxury of having a four or an eight hour

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,799
test and we just can't do that anymore

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,570
and then a final challenge there around

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,140
is the scale environment so means

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,630
continuous context we we often work in

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,490
low scale testing farm so they're not

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,369
reflective of production and therefore

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,490
it's it's it's impossible to test a

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,110
production like volumes you know I have

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,850
a question about testing but before I do

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,530
that I want to ask a question I should

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,939
have asked from the beginning which is

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,220
what does your if for those who aren't

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,970
familiar with your company what is your

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,340
company do

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,569
okay so capacitors we're specialists in

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,760
capacity and performance management

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,040
we're a consulting company and we

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,109
deliver our consultancy with some

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,599
software that we've developed and some

00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:26,079
processes and methodologies we've honed

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,879
over the last 15 years okay now here now

00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,040
my question that our about your

00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:34,239
methodologies so what so what techniques

00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,159
do you use to ensure that you that you

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,489
get a reliable performance that when the

00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,139
testing environment is as perhaps not

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:44,139
production quality yeah so there's a

00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:47,010
framework we've developed that takes any

00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:50,829
technology that's a bit under test and

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,049
exposes 16 key performance and capacity

00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:55,689
metrics that describe the performance

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:57,639
capacity of that system so that's the

00:02:55,689 --> 00:03:00,760
first thing so it's abstracting that out

00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,099
from the system and then we're measuring

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,379
those KPIs when we're doing the testing

00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,299
and then we've got some software that

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:09,459
has some smart analytics and smart

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,530
pattern matching that looks in a you

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,939
know in a very short test on a low scale

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:18,129
environment looks for unusual patterns

00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:20,109
we call them performance anti-pattern so

00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:23,650
it looks for these unusual patterns that

00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:27,040
are symptomatic of a performance bug and

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,840
that helps us to detect performance bugs

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,590
on these low scale environments on these

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,079
very short test windows so you mentioned

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,329
earlier that you do a lot of work with

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,669
companies helping them move to the cloud

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:42,489
how does performance capacity planning

00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,190
change in the cloud yeah that's

00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:48,099
interesting so you know in the old world

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,530
you know 15 years ago we were capacity

00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:52,840
planning and companies big organizations

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,290
had very large data centers with tens of

00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,639
thousands and servers in the new world I

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,709
mean in the old world the the question

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,989
was well when do we need to invest in

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,060
more servers when do we need to invest

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,729
in a new data center to house those

00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,919
servers in the new world with cloud it's

00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:15,699
it's subtly different we're getting

00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,759
asked by CIOs and CFOs well what should

00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,919
my budget be for next year on cloud OPEX

00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,500
so it's really important now for

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:25,870
organizations not necessary to plan

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,530
their capacity but to plan their spend

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,960
on

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:35,380
chasity in the cloud and giving CIOs and

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,410
CFOs that visibility is enormous ly

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,810
powerful for those guys

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,580
so what other challenges do people face

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,760
when they're moving to the cloud and you

00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,570
know what advice do you have for them

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,650
yeah I mean it's the clouds are

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:54,520
wonderful set of technologies and

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,470
enables people to move faster it does

00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,320
though it does bring with it a risk of

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:04,390
uncontrolled or managed spend so we do

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,240
find organizations that are moving very

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,520
quickly and deploying into the cloud at

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,750
very fast rates that the once that is

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,840
deployed varies the the level of

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,240
capacity sizing this is not optimal and

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,330
therefore you can get a lot of unplanned

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,240
or unforeseen expenditure in the cloud

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,460
so really that the the number one thing

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,550
I would say is for when you're in that

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,260
development and test cycle to make sure

00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,870
you're testing the efficiency of that

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,550
software what you want to do is prevent

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,190
inefficient software or what we would

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,680
call bloated software from ending up in

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,919
production in the cloud because

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,680
inefficient software carries a cost more

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,530
than ever yeah absolutely I mean we've

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,620
been involved with a few engagements one

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,789
particular engagement where we helped

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,310
optimize some software to has already

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:02,680
delivered in the cloud and in that case

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,270
we were delivering by optimizing the

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,550
software we were delivering tens of

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,550
millions of dollars in savings in cloud

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:12,479
optics Wow that's gotta be a real worry

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,979
for companies that you know that are

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,150
considering moving to an or very new to

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:21,789
it might not plan and plan to to you

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:23,830
know streamline their software make it

00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:28,060
efficient enough to save space that's

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,650
right I think you know in in the old

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,010
world I guess people were who were

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,210
building the software were separates of

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:37,450
the people who are running the software

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,159
so as we move more and more to DevOps I

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,210
think the people who are building the

00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,340
software going to be

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,440
sponsible for running this software in

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,479
the cloud and also be responsible for

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,639
the budgets associated with their with

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,130
the capacity in the cloud so as

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,680
hopefully as we move on more towards

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,990
DevOps will will see these best

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,669
practices being adopted yeah I think

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,419
you're right and I think one's just

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:04,750
gonna it DevOps is definitely becoming I

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,979
think a more popular even know what you

00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,319
call it because it's not really a

00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:10,419
methodology but a way of working I

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,840
suppose and now that the cloud is

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:15,789
becoming you know more popular I see

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,180
those to come driving each other to

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,039
being just I mean like the way to do

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,440
business

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,720
absolutely so this is your first

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,820
velocity conference what do you think so

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,699
far I think it's great I think the

00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:35,800
answer is really good collegiate and

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:37,780
very very much a community so it's that

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,909
worked well for us we you know we come

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,039
to these conferences to learn what

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:44,139
people are doing in the industry and

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:47,500
that helps to shape the direction of our

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,389
software and our services yeah I think

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,070
it's been a it's been a really good

00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,710
experience people are willing to share

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:56,680
experiences and that's the best way we

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,099
can we can all learn well I couldn't

00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,900
agree more

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,680
thank you so much for joining us today

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,680
thanks Nikki

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,840
