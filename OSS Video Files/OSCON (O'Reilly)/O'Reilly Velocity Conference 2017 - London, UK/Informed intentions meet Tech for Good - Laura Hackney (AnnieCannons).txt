	00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,469
so when you're engaging in tech4good you

00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,200
have to ask who's at four and who's at

00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:14,410
the table which brings me to my second

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,969
case study of what not to do we've had a

00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,310
lot of organizations come to us with

00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:20,830
ideas a lot of hackathon winning

00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,090
projects companies coming to us and

00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,380
saying we built this great thing it's

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,640
already in deployment what do you think

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,070
about this look at how we're fighting

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,830
trafficking and some of them missed the

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,330
mark and missing the mark just doesn't

00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,239
mean that you don't get the optimal

00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,370
number of users it means that someone

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,530
could get hurt or injured assaulted even

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,000
and so I'm going to talk through some of

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,060
these examples that we've seen the most

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,489
often so attack of the bots you have a

00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,670
lot of people who come to us and say I

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:50,800
have this amazing AI that I want to test

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,540
out deep learning maybe some natural

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,489
language processing it's this really

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,920
cool idea some of them are really cool

00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,200
ideas but one of them that we actually

00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,760
have seen is one that goes and scrapes

00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,870
data from certain websites where they

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,030
think that they can get the phone

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,430
numbers of people who are actually being

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,479
exploited today and their thought was

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,880
why don't we just send them information

00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:12,070
about resources or just let someone know

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,210
that we care about them but

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,340
unfortunately if you're someone who's

00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,690
being exploited and your phone is being

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,820
controlled by someone else if you're

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,799
getting text messages telling you how to

00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,260
leave your situation that could put you

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,790
in serious danger and so any kind of

00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,799
metrics that they were getting from this

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:29,440
product were things that we had to

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,820
cringe we just we kept saying well it

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,350
doesn't it doesn't matter if you're

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,600
getting a four percent response rate

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,740
what's happening to the other 96% of the

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,189
people that are getting these text

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,810
messages right we also had people say

00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:43,180
well that it's a big housing crisis

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,439
right how do we help survivors connect

00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,170
with more housing we'll set up like an

00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,360
Airbnb type platform and we said well

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,009
how can you ensure the safety of a

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,770
survivor how can you ensure who the host

00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:56,650
is and the response we got was no but

00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,390
look our technology is so cool right so

00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,100
you how I have to think about safety and

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,909
we have to be sure that survivor voices

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,360
are in these development processes let's

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:09,489
build a resource page I've seen so many

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,290
websites that have a landing page called

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,610
resources or a mobile app that has a

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,040
widget at the bottom that says here's

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,750
where you can go for resources and our

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,580
students actually call this having the

00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,200
book thrown at you because that's what

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,730
it feels like to receive a list of phone

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,680
numbers that you have to go through when

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,510
you're trying to get help and the

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,550
numbers are disconnected the shelter's

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,070
closed the shelter's full you don't meet

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,590
the right requirements it's a really

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:34,090
traumatic process so why don't we look

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,270
at the whole ecosystem of people

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,890
providing services and and discover ways

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,110
to make those referrals and to make

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,060
those connections optimize them let's

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,440
talk about that user experience that's

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,670
something that we as technologists can

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,250
do and then lastly you know we can't

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,900
ghost nonprofits anymore right I've

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,850
worked with a lot of nonprofits that

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,410
have said this developer came in they

00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,000
built this website or the security

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,550
protocol or they they helped us a little

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,350
bit with our data and then they left and

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,580
they took all of their knowledge and

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,320
they took our passwords and they took

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,450
something called an SSH key what's an

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,590
SSH key and how do I get it back right

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,270
so we have to make sure that we're

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:14,459
making commitments if we're trying to

00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,459
