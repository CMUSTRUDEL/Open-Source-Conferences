The concept of smart cities has evolved from sensored urban centers to platform ecosystems that combine data with new technologies such as the IoT, the cloud, and AI. The image of autonomous vehicles and flying drones is no longer science fiction, and this opens up many opportunities for energy saving, efficiency gain, and hyperconnectivity. But are these innovations making our societies more intelligent? Do these changes have an impact on human capabilities? Carme Artigas explores the challenges and opportunities of evolving from smart cities to intelligent societies.

there is not such one type of

00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,490
intelligence in fact there are five

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,099
types of intelligence that can be

00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:16,690
summarized into two cognitive

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:20,840
intelligence and emotional intelligence

00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:22,279
so my feeling is that all the efforts

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,509
that we have done with the smart series

00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:30,170
having only oriented towards cognitive

00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:33,350
intelligence efficiency operation a

00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:37,090
better use of technology more safety and

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:40,400
efficient transportation but what about

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,980
emotional intelligence at what extent

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,190
can we consider ourselves intelligent

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,360
society if we don't cover both sides of

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:52,880
that dimension so towards a more

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,180
intelligent society we should be

00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,650
measuring different things we should

00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,330
move from measuring KPIs key performance

00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:07,250
indicators and we should start measuring

00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:09,229
SV eyes social value indicators because

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,140
what better sign of an intelligent

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:15,649
society will be an indicator that tells

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:18,170
us about Extang a society is using big

00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:20,749
data for good that would be a great

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,329
indicator or big data for inclusiveness

00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:26,060
that would be a good educator of what an

00:01:23,329 --> 00:01:28,929
intelligent society is so I try to

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,310
imagine how we could measure an

00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:33,049
intelligent society and the conclusion

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,069
is that we only can measure an

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:40,939
intelligent society through context

00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:43,729
because context defines behavior and if

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,329
I imagine how good a dashboard of this

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,479
intelligent society would look like and

00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:53,329
we called it the dashboard of the cities

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,670
heartbeat as an opposition of the city

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:58,009
polls that was really what usually seen

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,109
as Mar series are measured against so

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:03,560
we've dropped this

00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:07,240
Singapore heartbeat dashboard and we are

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:11,300
measuring three different axes first one

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,090
urbanism with said context defines

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,300
behavior so what is our context and our

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,760
context is where we leave the

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,650
things we are surrounded with and we can

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,660
measure things like environment we know

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,160
that we already are measuring

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,920
environment but not only air quality for

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,180
example green areas and will extend the

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
number of squares made of our green

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,080
areas is determined or correlated with

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,700
the economic growth of a city

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,530
imagine we find an interesting

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,270
correlation all the governments in the

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,700
world will be you know planting trees

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,900
like math and that really great for

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,700
climate change so probably we should

00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,310
start thinking about those indicators

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,990
and see we find correlations a very

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,030
important aspect we think we should

00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:53,420
measure about our context is a structure

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,910
and design I would extend the beauty or

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:58,300
the ugliness of our buildings our make

00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,300
us different

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,140
