The concept of smart cities has evolved from sensored urban centers to platform ecosystems that combine data with new technologies such as the IoT, the cloud, and AI. The image of autonomous vehicles and flying drones is no longer science fiction, and this opens up many opportunities for energy saving, efficiency gain, and hyperconnectivity. But are these innovations making our societies more intelligent? Do these changes have an impact on human capabilities?
