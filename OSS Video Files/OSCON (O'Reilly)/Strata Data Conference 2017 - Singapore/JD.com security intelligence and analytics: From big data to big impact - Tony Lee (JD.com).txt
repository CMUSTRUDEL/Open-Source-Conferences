	00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,350
so let's look at the problems JD is

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,760
facing its mass scale right he has two

00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:16,529
hundred and thirty six point five

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,420
million users active users he has one

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,060
hundred and twenty thousand active

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,590
vendors which are solving you know

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,350
things on on JD platform and we have we

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,240
get 15 petabytes of data and this is

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,460
last year's number so it's a lot more

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,809
today look a freaking petabytes of data

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:41,840
every day we also completed one point

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:46,440
almost 1.6 billion orders in 2016 so

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
it's is a the scale is big and also look

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,230
at the problem that we're trying to

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,660
solve is very interesting problems we

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,270
are trying to transform consumer

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,680
experience through technology on one

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:05,070
side we say everybody who come to JD

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,340
calm or come to any of the offline store

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,040
the wheel stores that what with JD

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,689
they've got individual experience right

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,560
that and that can only be done through

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,740
big data and it's like a you know

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,900
everybody has their own store right and

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:27,119
also in history the the retail is always

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,549
you know producer produce things

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,009
manufacturer produce things and they

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,079
started to the consumer we also want

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,540
user feedback like we want user

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,150
participation in a process we want the

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,369
user to tell our supply chain what to

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,439
make what's in fashion what they want

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,049
right so it should be a two-way street

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,729
and that's that's what we call a smart

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,439
supply chain so all that has to do with

00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,869
consumer experience and what's more

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,740
let's look at logistics we want to

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,229
deliver goods to very far rural rural

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,829
areas and now we're deploying drones

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,399
unmanned airplanes to the to the way of

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,849
our areas we also want to deliver things

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,379
to you wherever you are you don't have

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,150
to go home and wait for your delivery

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:17,460
right where maybe you're shopping in the

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,760
mall and we would we

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:23,840
and our drone our a man vehicles to you

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,320
and deliver the goods right so those are

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,770
AI driven autonomous driving right

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,740
whether is we here cause or aircraft we

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:38,820
also want very high efficiency so we are

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,380
we have fully autonomous warehouse there

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,070
with a lot of more politics in it also

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,640
driven by think big data in AI and what

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,650
about at home right at home we there are

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,940
millions of devices right now connected

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:57,390
to the JD app and JD intelligent cloud

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,670
and those are devices there are not only

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,520
small devices that we see like

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,620
thermostats like alarms and things like

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,040
that we are talking about major

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,330
appliances like refrigerators like air

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,060
conditioning and washers dryers and so

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,670
on so those can be done only when you

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,980
work with the supply chain right what

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,660
with the manufacturers and and we have

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,320
done that so there are a lot of devices

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,050
why not connected and last but not least

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,930
FinTech so FinTech I think more and more

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,060
people are getting familiar with FinTech

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,200
because we have a huge amount data we

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,930
know a lot about the users the

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,960
manufacturers the merchants so we are

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,870
able to get them loans for example and

00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,630
we know a lot more than the banks do we

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,120
also don't know these facts very arty

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,860
right very very much in time and that

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,650
will give us a very huge advantage and

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:58,860
is a huge market there but also in the

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,140
future we want to manage people's

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,370
finances we're going to help them invest

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:07,550
and that is also driven by AI and big

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,550
data

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,290
