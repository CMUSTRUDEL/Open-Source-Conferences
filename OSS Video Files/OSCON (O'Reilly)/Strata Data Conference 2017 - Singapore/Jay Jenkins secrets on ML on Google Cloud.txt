hi my name is Paco Nathan I'm with

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,020
O'Reilly Media and I have the pleasure

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,700
of talking today with Jay Jenkins head

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,679
of customer engineering in Southeast

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,799
Asia at Google cloud platform and

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,379
looking forward to the topics here about

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,760
Google cloud platform welcome Jay thank

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,890
you very much

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,869
so can you tell us in general just what

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,310
what are y'all doing with Google cloud

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,130
platform how long has this been around

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,109
sure so I mean Google Cloud has actually

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,269
been around for 18 years right I mean I

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,610
think if you think about the products

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,050
that we've created you know Google

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,399
search itself you could consider sort of

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,719
a software as a service right where

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,610
essentially you're putting in three

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,870
words it's looking across trillions of

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,210
websites and trying to provide you an

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,309
answer very quickly and we were sort of

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,350
born there and along the way we actually

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,820
developed a lot of technologies and a

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,620
lot of that came through via open

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,030
research so for instance our MapReduce

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,460
paper right which led to things like

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,789
Hadoop but all these other technologies

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,649
we needed to build in order to build

00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,750
search but also to build seven other

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,730
products right so we've got seven

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,110
products with over a billion users right

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,970
to billion users on Android

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,950
we've got YouTube which delivers a

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,510
hundred billion our or was our 1 billion

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,119
hours of video every single day so

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,860
that's 114 thousand years for an

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,290
individual person to watch and that's a

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,780
lot of data and we ran into a lot of

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:21,360
problems ourselves you know in or in

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,729
order to and in order to deliver those

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,070
services we had to create a lot of

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,360
products internally and what we're doing

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,560
actually with Google cloud is we're

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,479
actually exposing a lot of those

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,259
products that we use internally to our

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,530
customers so right so now Google cloud

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,960
itself serves our customers billion

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,630
users as well well I can imagine that

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,399
along with the technologies and in the

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,140
internal products there's also just a

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,750
lot of learnings a lot of practice that

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,149
has gone in over this period two decades

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,610
yeah absolutely right and and one of the

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,040
problems we had was not only in scaling

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,710
our infrastructure but also scaling our

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,020
operations right so and really in order

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,659
to scale our operations or really how we

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,460
had to make it so we weren't scaling our

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,110
operations that the same sat at the same

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,599
time we were scaling our our

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,869
infrastructure we really had to invent a

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,870
lot of these technologies

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,450
and I think for us what was true then

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,830
was you know that Google was was really

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,970
the only one of the only companies that

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,890
were having these sorts of big data

00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,599
problems but that's not true today right

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,519
a lot of companies have exactly the same

00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:25,750
problems and different problems and the

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:28,150
faster we can get a lot of the

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,650
technologies we're using to the market

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,349
the more that everybody can leverage

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,720
those excellent well in these customer

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,099
engagements than or is I imagine there's

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,830
a lot of Education as well people

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:39,970
needing to learn how to use the tooling

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,599
that's available what are best practices

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:45,310
etc is that more of what your team is

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,079
doing yeah so that's exactly what our

00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,120
jobs are as customer engineers it's

00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,470
working with our customers finding out

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
what their current solutions are which

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,099
they might want to map migrate we're

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,810
taking a look at what new solutions they

00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:58,390
might want to build and see how they

00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,879
might want to architect those and the

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,379
cloud can be treated differently right

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,390
because you're not actually purchasing

00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,650
the infrastructure and if you treat the

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,849
cloud the same way as you're treating

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,140
your on-premise infrastructure you're

00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,120
not getting a lot of get a lot of the

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,980
benefits that the cloud can provide

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,319
right the ability to not only to scale

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,780
up but to also scale back down quickly

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,870
when you when you need to interesting

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,420
now Google is famous for work with

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,340
machine learning and AI of course what

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,989
types of machine learning services are

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,060
being rolled out for businesses to take

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,440
advantage yeah absolutely so I you know

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,180
I think one of the biggest things that

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,069
we've released in the past couple years

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,950
so actually two years ago we released

00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:39,250
tensorflow it's currently on version 1.4

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,160
and it is a machine learning framework

00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:45,549
that a lot that essentially uses data

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,639
flow graphs in order to do machine

00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:53,109
learning so customers can take their

00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:55,389
data create their recipe and get their

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,130
answers out of that in addition to that

00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,700
and in order to support that we also

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,769
have TP use which we've created as well

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,660
right so a couple of years ago and we

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:07,599
created TP use we've been using those

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,250
internally for a long time and in May we

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,489
then iterated on that and created

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,989
version 2 which actually not only does

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:16,959
the inference really well but also does

00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,280
the training really well and we're gonna

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,650
make those available to cloud customers

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,050
soon as well so that'll be part of the

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,410
cloud instances that you that's right so

00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,660
besides a normal CP

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,710
use you can use the GPUs of course that

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,480
you can use which a lot of people are

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,480
using for machine learning today they'll

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,710
also be able to use TV use and one of

00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,140
the themes that we're seeing out of the

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,210
conference's here is that hardware is

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,610
evolving rapidly and in many different

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,000
ways so we hear about what's going on

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:46,610
with very interesting processors GPUs

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,900
GPUs in the cloud etc but also I think

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,890
that there's interesting work with

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,330
interconnects and just leveraging again

00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,410
sort of the windfall of what you've

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,120
developed over the past couple decades

00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,520
for how to run these large data centers

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,110
right yeah absolutely and it's a it is a

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,000
large investment and again you know with

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,560
with Google it's not as you said it's

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,570
it's about interconnect as well so it's

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,460
not just about the data centers but it's

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,990
about you know buying that large scale

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,520
pipe that actually connects all these

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,710
things together to give us that high

00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,060
availability and reliability and making

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,400
sure that we can move that data around

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,730
the globe quickly now we were talking

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,810
earlier and you'd mention some use cases

00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,030
it's sound like some people are even

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,560
using tensorflow in the cloud directly

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,420
to provide services I mean you can build

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,360
a model and then build web services on

00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,920
top of it that's right so yeah so using

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,660
tools like tensorflow we actually have

00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,730
machine learning engine right so if you

00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,110
yeah if you're using tensorflow and

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,820
you're you're abstracting at the right

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,919
level using s things like estimators

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,270
obviously tons of flows free right you

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,620
can download that you can run that on

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,000
your laptop you can do the training

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,030
locally but if you want to do

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
large-scale training then you have to

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,600
decide do I want to set up now my own

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,790
cluster in order to do this training or

00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,600
could I use a service and that's what

00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,400
we're doing with Google cloud

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,750
essentially you can actually use machine

00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,820
learning engine as a service to help you

00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,919
actually scale out that training and do

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,390
that training on our platform and as I

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,300
said before soon you'll be able to use

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:07,040
things like GPUs which have extra

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,710
efficiencies so TP use are actually

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,050
designed to do matrix multiplication

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:16,010
really well right so tensors which are

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,820
just an array of arrays certainly GPUs

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:21,620
have a considerable efficiency over CPUs

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,140
because they can do things in parallel

00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,300
but they what TP use give you is that

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,419
ability to do matrix multiplication

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm looking forward to that I basically

00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,039
we do a lot of work with large graphs

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,539
and so tensors are the magic word yeah

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,490
it's really leverage graphs because

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:41,360
that's the thing that you miss with just

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,789
linear algebra absolutely so you know

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,849
I'm interested in can you give some

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,310
examples of large use cases here in

00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:50,750
Southeast Asia where they've been able

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,569
to leverage the cloud and leverage

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:55,190
tensorflow for for drastic improvement

00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,199
yeah absolutely so actually one example

00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,270
I can give is in Australia so there's a

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:04,099
company called Maxwell MRI and they

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,659
actually built a a large a large machine

00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:08,210
learning framework to look at prostate

00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:10,400
cancer so they're taking these images

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,110
they've trained their models using tools

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,270
like tensor flow and they've actually

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,270
been able to reduce the diagnosis for

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,659
prostate cancer from a week down to 15

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,690
minutes

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:22,250
Oh fantastic right so that's not only a

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,539
boon for that provider but you know

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,639
think about the effect for patients

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,099
right so rapidly is absolutely right

00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,400
rather than having to wait a week you're

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:33,229
waiting for 15 minutes fantastic and is

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,080
that largely due to being able to

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,330
leverage these kinds of technologies the

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,380
scale of cloud absolutely right well

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,469
it's I think it's a number of things

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,389
number one is you know they would have

00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:46,789
already had the data right they have you

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,409
know years and years of these MRI images

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,090
with which they have and they have

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,590
positive and negative results this was

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,690
cancer this wasn't cancer this was

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,300
cancer this wasn't cancer so they had

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,830
that and tensorflow then gave them an

00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,120
easy framework in order to create these

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,740
models right so they can create these

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
data flow graphs they can understand how

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,759
to do those things then there are also

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,430
lots of open source imaging models right

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,330
so you get to stand on the source of

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,180
stanlon on the shoulders of the Giants

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,520
who've come before you and you can use

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,400
then use those models and create new

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,169
models in create and and then train

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,090
those models using something like

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,370
machine learning engine which again

00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,389
gives you that broad scale so you don't

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,629
have to set up your own tensorflow

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,990
cluster which isn't as easy as people

00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:31,279
would like and do that training and then

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,979
just shut that down then you've got your

00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,329
model and you can do inference in the

00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:36,829
cloud right you can take that model and

00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:38,039
put that in the cloud but you can also

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:39,719
do that inference model

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,310
local machine or now with tensorflow

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,649
light you can actually take a lot of

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,019
those models and run those on mobile

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:49,860
devices or even IOT devices exactly

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,600
fantastic what other types of API is

00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,519
that beyond machine learning and

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,259
tensorflow imagine is quite an array

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,550
yeah so one of the questions we always

00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,350
get is you know where do we get started

00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,850
you know we've got a we've got a bunch

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,769
of really fantastic developers but

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,870
they're not machine learning people we

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:05,579
don't have data scientists and PhDs on

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,250
staff in order to create you know our

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,480
own machine learning models so one of

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,000
the things that we've done at Google is

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,500
we've pre-built some models for you so

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,620
we've trained some models and we've

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,660
exposed those models as api's some of

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,720
the most popular ones are around vision

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,759
and speech and natural language so our

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,889
cloud vision API for example essentially

00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,040
you can take an image submit that to our

00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:31,319
model via an API and we'll give you back

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,269
the labels for that will detect things

00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:35,009
like objects and that kind of thing you

00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,139
can also search on more abstract ideas

00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:40,170
like conference this is a photo of a

00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:42,180
conference is the person smiling we also

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,240
do things like face detection so we can

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,500
actually look at landmarks as well so if

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,300
we notice the Eiffel Tower in the

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,490
background we can tell you that this is

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,940
in Paris even without any sort of you

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:56,399
know geo tagging in those in the image

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,459
metadata and actually one of the great

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,170
examples that one of our cloud deverel

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,230
people Sarah Robinson likes to use is

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,630
she actually has a photo of the Paris

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,100
hotel in Las Vegas and it knows the

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,610
difference between that Eiffel Tower and

00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:13,050
the Eiffel Tower in Paris that desert we

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,569
also have things like the speech API

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,920
right so being able to recognize 110

00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,050
different languages and actually give

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,519
you the text output of that and that's

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,920
the same sort of technology we're using

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,620
in things like Google assistant and

00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,540
that's available for anyone to use they

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,000
can take that and also do things like

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,380
dictation if they would like we also

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,199
have things like the natural language

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,870
API so the natural language API actually

00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,600
looks at the syntax of a sentence and

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,310
can actually understand the sentiment

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,139
but also the specific entities that are

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,029
discussed in that so we can give you

00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,949
automatic Wikipedia links for example to

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,199
specific entities that are discussed and

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:49,649
also sentiment around the specific

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:53,129
entities

00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:55,529
is any of that material or those API is

00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:56,819
it leveraging say knowledge graph to

00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,369
some extent to be able to figure out

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,899
inference to other resources yeah

00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:02,730
absolutely so it's based on a lot of the

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,519
same technologies but these specific

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,679
models have been more generalized a bit

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,720
more so that anybody can use them and

00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,819
call them fantastic well we're actually

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,490
making use of the video transcription

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,170
service the video intelligence API yeah

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,730
right so that's sort of like the vision

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,059
API to the next level of right so the

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,889
video intelligence API goes a step

00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,629
further I think than they then the

00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:26,389
vision API not only does it tag it

00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:29,910
actually tells you sort of where that is

00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:32,160
in in the video and I you know I think

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,559
about these companies with like large

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,389
you know video archives that are just

00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,540
sitting there and who knows if you know

00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:41,189
you might have a small clip of somebody

00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,709
swimming in one if you want to do it

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:45,689
sort of grab all the swimming archives

00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,279
from all of your videos you could

00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:49,410
actually run the cloud video

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,059
intelligence API against those find

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,869
those markers and actually bring those

00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,269
clips up

00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:56,429
fantastic we had a meet-up last night

00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,759
here and a couple speakers from Google

00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:01,259
for showing magenta out of tensorflow so

00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:03,300
you know that stole the show what what

00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:05,040
you could do with drawing and imagery

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,449
and recognition but it really

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,459
underscored there's a lot of open source

00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:09,870
available from Google if you want to

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:12,740
jump in and start learning how to use

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,389
this definitely and and also you know

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,790
and also coming out of the community as

00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,889
well you know there's there is a lot out

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,720
there and right now I think there's a

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,670
huge movement as well in terms of

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,290
bringing out visualizations of those

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,420
models as well so you can understand

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,980
what's going on inside of that black box

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,959
right as these models get bigger and

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,370
bigger and bigger it becomes harder and

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,980
harder to understand actually what's

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,209
going on mathematically inside so a lot

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,870
of tools being developed today are

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,279
around trying to think about how the AI

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,049
is thinking about those things

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,600
interesting so for model

00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:46,270
interpretability and exam ability

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,280
lineage that

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,560
everything sessions such important

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,240
topics here as AI moves out into

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,680
mainstream business from what we're

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,380
seeing at the conference the

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,210
interpretability well J what's the most

00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,380
common mistake that people make when

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,690
they're they're getting into machine

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,310
learning what do you see share so a lot

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,050
of people think that machine learning is

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,850
some sort of a magic thing that I can

00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,950
just point it at my data wherever that

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,100
data is and it'll just come up with some

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,960
sort of valuable insight we really have

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,780
to sort of work in Reverse what's the

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,160
question that you want to ask what's

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,380
that what are the answers then that you

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,450
expect and what are the what's the data

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,790
that I need in order to get me those

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,350
answers yes machine learning will create

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,210
that recipe in order to get you those

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,880
answers but it's not going to help you

00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,650
ask the question once you figure that

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,440
out once you know sort of what data you

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,210
might need to collect then you need that

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,470
good data right if you have a but if you

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,600
have biased data you're going to have a

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,520
biased model so it's important to sort

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,310
of understand what's in that data right

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,160
so if you use tools like data prep where

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,360
I as a data scientist you know I I don't

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,830
want to say hit I don't want to have to

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,210
like code my my ETL rules right data

00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,800
prep allows me to actually take a look

00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,660
at the histograms of data I can actually

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,140
do feature engineering inside of that

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:04,300
before the data ever hits that and as it

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,130
goes through that ETL before it gets to

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,110
my model all my features and things will

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,910
be set up I'll understand the histograms

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,220
of data you know again I don't have to

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,110
do all that work you know in in Python

00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,880
code just to take a look and do the

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,490
analysis on the data inside of my

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,080
notebook oh fantastic I mean one of the

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,260
big messages out of the conference for

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,580
businesses is to really leverage machine

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,200
learning you have to have your ducks in

00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,450
a row in terms of preparing your data

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,040
having your practices knocking down

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,780
silos cleaning up your data

00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,490
understanding it so it sounds like

00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,290
really there's a full range there that

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,270
can be applied at the Google cloud yeah

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,950
absolutely right and I think again
