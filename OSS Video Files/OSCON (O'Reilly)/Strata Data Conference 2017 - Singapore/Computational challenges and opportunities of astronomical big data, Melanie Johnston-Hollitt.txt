Melanie Johnston-Hollitt is an internationally prominent radio astronomer, the director of astronomy and astrophysics at Victoria University of Wellington, and CEO of Peripety Scientific Ltd., an astrophysics and data analytics research company based in Wellington, New Zealand. Melanie serves as chair of the board of the $60 million Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope and is a founding member of the board of directors of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Organisation Ltd., which is tasked with building the world’s largest radio telescope. In her nearly 20-year career, she has been involved in design, construction, and operation of several major radio telescopes, including the Low Frequency Array in the Netherlands, the MWA in Australia, and the SKA, which will be hosted in both Australia and South Africa. These instruments produce massive quantities of data, requiring new and disruptive technologies to allow value to be extracted from the data deluge. As a result, Melanie’s recent interests span the intersection between radio astronomy, signal processing, and big data analytics. She leads a multidisciplinary team in Wellington that is investigating how best to meet the science challenges of these next-generation instruments in the big data era.

I'd like to take this opportunity to

00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,250
show you what data from a radio

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,169
telescope looks like because when I

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,059
often speak to people about radio

00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:15,740
astronomy they believe that radio

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,440
telescopes listen to the universe and

00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,019
that you can't create beautiful images

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,859
but you can and this is an example of

00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:27,199
such an image so this is data from a

00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,730
low-frequency radio telescope which is

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,589
in the Western Australian desert it's

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,830
called the Murchison widefield array and

00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:35,750
it's a precursor to the giant Square

00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,340
Kilometre Array telescope project that

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,020
we're working on at the moment which

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,100
will dwarf even the Large Hadron

00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:45,890
Collider as a large data project so what

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:48,620
you see here is a section of our galaxy

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,270
the Milky Way in three colors of radio

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,910
light if you like so three radio

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,820
frequencies and you see these beautiful

00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,510
blue glowing regions of hydrogen gas and

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,460
these circular features which are

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,549
supernova remnants the most spectacular

00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,530
way a star can die and there's a huge

00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:07,729
amount of science that we could extract

00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,560
from this image and I could talk to you

00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,840
about that for hours but that's not why

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,850
I'm here what I'm here to talk to you

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,340
about is how we take data like this and

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,899
scale it up when we have an instrument

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,479
of the size of the SKA

00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:22,219
and how our extraction techniques need

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,939
to develop and evolve to be able to do

00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:28,039
that so we wrote a science case for the

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,289
SK a couple of years ago and it's 2,000

00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:32,270
pages long and I'm gonna try and

00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:34,759
summarize what we're trying to do in

00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,009
terms of science in one sound byte which

00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,929
is that radio astronomers are trying to

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:42,350
build a machine that will allow us to

00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:45,229
make the highest resolution fastest

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,719
framerate movie of the evolving radio

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,609
universe ever and those of you that have

00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,009
dealt with video know that that is a lot

00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,799
of data so let's talk about the SK and

00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,479
how much data it is so first of all this

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,909
is going to be an instrument built on

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,880
two continents so there's going to be

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:04,490
200 dishes built in South Africa not

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,350
unlike the dishes that you see here in

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,899
the slides and there's going to be a

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,000
hundred and thirty thousand dipole

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,620
antennas in the desert in Western

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,150
Australia so those are those

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,490
christmas-tree like things that you see

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,300
at the bottom there in terms of

00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,640
understanding

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,770
the data rates for the ska I refer you

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,680
to these two graphics so this is now

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:27,140
splitting the two telescopes into their

00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,930
component parts so the telescope in

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,090
South Africa with 200 dishes produces

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,300
around 2 terabytes of data per second

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,340
raw data 62 exabytes a year but the

00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,770
telescope in Australia the low-frequency

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,110
telescope produces a hundred and

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:45,500
fifty-seven terabytes of data per second

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,350
it's 4.9 zettabytes of data per year and

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,540
we have to process that in real time as

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,970
the data is continually observed from

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,140
the telescope so that's the equivalent

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,780
of 35,000 DVDs every second so to say

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,160
that the computer for this project is

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,000
challenging is somewhat of an

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,630
understatement

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,670
there is not yet compute available that

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,040
can process the data that we want to

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,900
collect and use to understand the

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,550
universe but we have a team of five

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,920
hundred scientists and engineers spread

00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,830
across our 10 ska member countries who

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,840
are working on just this problem how do

00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,450
we actually get the compute together to

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,570
be able to process these data so what

00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,410
we've come up with is some numbers so

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,780
what we need to do is we need to ingest

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:36,230
400 gigabytes of data per second we need

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:38,510
to distribute 400 million tasks and run

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,220
a machine continuously to be able to do

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,010
that and at peak it's going to run it

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,910
about half and exa plot per second this

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:48,740
will produce 1.30 bytes of intermediate

00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,250
data which we have to create and destroy

00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,410
and then after all of that we produce a

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,300
petabyte of imaging data a day which we

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,350
distribute to regional centers and

00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,100
archives around the world for

00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,100
astronomers to look at

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,690
