I can show a two-year-old the picture of

00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:10,510
one banana and the two-year-old can

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,340
leverage their intelligence to

00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,719
immediately start recognizing the

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,119
difference between a banana and a

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,140
watermelon we have to show machine

00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,519
learning algorithms 100,000 bananas a

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,830
hundred thousand bananas because before

00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,419
they can do it accurately but once they

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,240
can do it they can do it quicker than us

00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:30,609
and better than us facial-recognition

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,420
any one of you if you're really good you

00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:35,680
can link back a thousand faces just a

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,329
thousand faces if you're really good

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,090
most of us can only link our back 100

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,500
faces to their names

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,449
computers can link back millions of

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,590
faces to their names so this is really

00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,780
what it's about it's about taking a

00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,030
specific decision that we make and

00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,070
automating that and a scale better than

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,190
us but it's not about intelligence at

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,050
large one of my favorite examples comes

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,940
from JP Morgan one of our customers

00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,760
where they were able to analyze legal

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,350
documents for contracts with their

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,280
partners over the last couple of decades

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,800
and automated the decisions of 400,000

00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,800
lawyer hours into 10 minutes

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,189
