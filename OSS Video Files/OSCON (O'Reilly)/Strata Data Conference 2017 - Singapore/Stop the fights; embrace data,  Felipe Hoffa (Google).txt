Title: Stop the fights; embrace data,  Felipe Hoffa (Google)
Publication date: 2017-12-07
Playlist: Strata Data Conference 2017 - Singapore
Description: 
	Organizations waste hours to endless discussions, and people lose sleep to internet debates. Can big data change this? Google Cloud is here to help. Felipe Hoffa explains that solid data-based conclusions are possible when stakeholders have easy access to analyze all relevant data.

This keynote is sponsored by Google.

	00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:11,959
strata we need to talk

00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:15,100
really we there is a huge debate and we

00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:17,510
need to put an end to it and I mean

00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,000
people don't know where to put their

00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,570
commas

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,980
I'm talking about sequel I'm sure most

00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,930
of you must love sequel

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:32,119
I love sequel it's born in 1978 and it's

00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,890
the one language with the best thing we

00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,270
have when we want to analyze analyze

00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:41,390
data but it's not perfect most of you

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,670
must have learned sequel with a sentence

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:46,640
like this this is how you get one column

00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,610
of data this is how you get two columns

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,559
then you glow for three and suddenly

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:58,579
things don't work what's wrong here that

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,160
extra comma yes you've been there people

00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:02,989
would not allow you to put a hanging

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,909
chrome at the end unlike any other

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:07,490
modern language and this has driven

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,630
people to two different camps there are

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,639
people that put the comma at the end

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,189
people that put their commas at the

00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:16,549
beginning who likes their comments at

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:21,579
the end who likes their comas at the

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:24,679
beginning you monsters that's ugly

00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:26,329
well I'm one of you I like to put my

00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:29,719
comments at the beginning I find this

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:31,130
more productive but it's hard to

00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:36,069
convince people about this

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:40,549
so I happen to work at Google where we

00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:43,039
make decisions based on data also I work

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:45,560
for Google cloud platform where we share

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,899
our best tools with everyone so things

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,049
that we use internally you are also able

00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,909
to use and one of them is bigquery with

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,159
the query we can analyze not only

00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:58,009
terabytes of data in seconds we are also

00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:01,009
able to share data with within our

00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:05,419
teammates within third parties publicly

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:07,939
and we love using it to collaborate to

00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:10,250
discuss to take the same data and reach

00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:13,070
conclusions together in this case for

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,260
example I have all of get cos data's

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,190
stored in bigquery and with the query of

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,590
things like this I can see

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:25,110
many events github has seen this year

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:28,140
360 million events I can join this table

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,440
with other tables I can bring in for

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,960
example count the number of distinct

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,910
users active users this year and I can

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,010
bring another table to see where are

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,950
they coming from what are the most

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:46,320
popular countries on github the United

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:49,440
States China India which we would call

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,480
an unfair ranking I mean these are the

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,970
biggest countries of course they have

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,890
the most users so let's bring in more

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,950
tables let's bring in more data let's

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,070
get the countries that have the most

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,440
github users per capita and now we have

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:10,020
countries like Iceland Sweden Norway on

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,540
top cold countries or not so now we can

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,200
bring in more data we can join this with

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,810
the world

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,960
weather data that we have in and we can

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,900
get a chart like this which shows that

00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,550
yes the coldest countries up on the top

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,980
left are the ones with the highest

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,470
concentration of programmers the

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,680
opposite on the other side but if you

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:36,030
look at that point on the top right

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,890
that's Singapore yes Singapore you have

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,090
the highest concentration of programmers

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,860
on github

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:47,400
within the hot countries congratulations

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,040
but let me get back to our problem where

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,150
do we put our commas and this is not

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,220
tough virtual spaces this really matters

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,580
and I'm going to bring in all code I can

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,040
find on github I'm going to analyze a

00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:04,290
gigabytes of sequel code and I will use

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,690
it to count the number of lines that end

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,350
with a comma start with a comma and the

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,769
results show that most lines and with a

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,590
comma

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:20,790
I lost or not because the real question

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:23,160
is what projects are more successful how

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,140
do we measure that the number of stars

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,020
the number of stars last year the number

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,000
of contributors the activity etc etc we

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,710
can define our success metrics and we

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,320
can measure

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:36,020
and we can write a query we can get the

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,620
results in seconds and it basically says

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,020
that projects that allow leading people

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:46,400
to write lead in comas double as

00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:49,100
productive as the others it's true you

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,960
can go and measure it in any dimension

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,699
you want thank you yes you were the link

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,550
chromosome so my message here is that

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,949
maybe I will not stop all fights because

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,080
I'm sure I didn't convince everyone here

00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,780
someone will ask about correlation

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,449
causation how do you are you measuring

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,000
these why an average and the whole point

00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:15,229
is that you can find me you can use the

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,900
same tools you can use the same queries

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:20,300
and data and analyze it and find me some

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,210
people will never convince no matter how

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:30,349
much data we show them we call them into

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:34,360
three analysts sorry but yes at least we

00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:34,360
should embrace data in this fight

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,580
