	00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,129
we launched in q1 2015 and I'm talking

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,610
about October 2015 and we grew 50x by

00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:16,290
them so at this point of time Gajic was

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,660
doing three hundred thousand orders per

00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:24,660
day and that curve needed more and more

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,849
supply how do you get more supply what

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:31,769
do you do that point of time we wanted

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:33,410
more and more drivers we did a

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,100
calculation smart back of the

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,630
calculation and the back of an

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,870
electrical a chantelle told us that we

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,420
need fifty thousand drivers in next four

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,000
weeks if we can't have fifty thousand

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,670
drivers in next four weeks people will

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,129
get disappointed in us because they'll

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,800
not find drivers they will not be able

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,809
to get food they'll not be able to do

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,890
many things which you should be able to

00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:02,190
do when you have supply so what do we do

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,989
if this is the quest to hydro 2,000

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,729
driver is very difficult we have never

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,860
done that I have never run a company

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,080
like that our CEO never did a company

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,060
like that and we never seen something

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,950
like that we where the people who come

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,060
from very traditional backgrounds and

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,890
this first time for us so attitude to

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,140
hit the impossible was amazing so what

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,530
we did this interesting story we hired a

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,920
stadium and we put a clockwork conveyor

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,720
belt system where your driver comes in

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,060
he gets on boarded he gets his jacket he

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,130
gets his helmet he gets in at installed

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,829
once he gets her app installed we

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,110
actually send him out of the stadium and

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,450
within 30 minutes he gets a try he gets

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,180
order and there's amazing Steelers for

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,430
the driver and what ended up happening

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:50,630
was we ended up hiring 150,000 drivers

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,630
in four weeks

00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,280
