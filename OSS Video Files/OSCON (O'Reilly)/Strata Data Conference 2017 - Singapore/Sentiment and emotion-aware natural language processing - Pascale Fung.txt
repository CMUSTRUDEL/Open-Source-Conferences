	00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:14,019
how many of you have seen this movie in

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:17,170
this movie this is robot that assistant

00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,199
to the astronauts and the scientists but

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,650
this robot is also very empathetic it

00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:27,279
understands emotions it even has a sense

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,789
of humor and this is not that far in the

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,100
future even though interstellar travel

00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,260
is very verifying the future a machine

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,670
like this is what we are building right

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:42,909
now so how are we doing how do we do

00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,019
that first of all again we use a neural

00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,960
network architecture called

00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:51,250
convolutional neural net to recognize

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,339
human emotion from tone of voice and the

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:57,250
advantage of using CNN is that it will

00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:59,680
automatically extract features from raw

00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,900
input data meaning you can speak to the

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,820
machine directly without going through

00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,840
any signal processing and future

00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,490
extraction and the CNN will extract and

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,400
recognize your emotion directly that

00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:15,040
enables emotion recognition from tone of

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,770
voice to be real-time and instantaneous

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,150
which is very very important for human

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:25,480
machine interactions we also have built

00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,120
a system in my lab which uses long short

00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,980
term memory and actually reinforcement

00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,190
learning to learn to have a sense of

00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,520
humor so we feed a lot of TV sitcoms

00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:39,730
such as Big Bang Theory such as Sun feel

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,790
to the system and then learns to do two

00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,490
things one it learns to recognize your

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,820
joke when you're talking yourself you

00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,400
myrrh

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:51,400
learns to recognize that so it will

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,580
laugh or not according to the sense of

00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,520
humor in your speech and the second task

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,860
which is more elusive and much harder is

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,610
that the machine will come back with a

00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,860
punchline

00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,740
during the conversation with you when

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,789
you say something so conversational

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,040
humor consists of a setup you usually

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,870
set up a scenario through conversation

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,700
and then there's a trigger for a joke

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,840
and then there's a punchline

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,030
and after the

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,640
punchline that's when people laugh so

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,190
this machine is learning to have a sense

00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,860
of humor through conversations we call

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:30,099
it the Sheldon bot because its sense of

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,379
humor is not quite there but it's

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,599
getting there this is one of the

00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:39,310
toughest tasks in terms of emotion

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:41,310
recognition and emotion generation we

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,620
have also built algorithms to recognize

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,660
your personality from talking to you

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,569
from looking at your facial expressions

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,569
the way you speak the kind of words you

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:56,200
use how often you how often you pause

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:58,569
how fast you speak tells the Machine

00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,209
whether you're neurotic person you're an

00:02:58,569 --> 00:03:03,849
extrovert whether you look at people

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:08,140
when you talk it tells people tells the

00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:10,390
Machine whether you are introvert and so

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,150
on and so forth so again we use

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,750
something called a try model deep

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,730
learning framework where we combine

00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,280
facial expression recognition tone of

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:25,680
voice recognition and the use of words

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,430
recognition together in one deep neural

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,709
deep learning framework and we do the

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,799
backpropagation altogether at the end

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,569
all right this is a this is a very

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,150
interesting application of deep learning

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:42,849
so why do we want to recognize people's

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,799
personalities so when we humans

00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,280
communicate with each other we actually

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,730
adapt the way we talk to the personality

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,040
of our audience right you talk to an

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,099
introvert person differently from when

00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,220
you talk to extrovert person and for

00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:02,560
commercial systems of humor human

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,340
machine interactive systems it needs to

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,579
understand the the personality of the

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,730
user in order to improve engagement in

00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:14,109
order to communicate better for and

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,599
there are other applications of

00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:20,440
personality recognitions such as in HR

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:24,820
systems you can use a robot to detect

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:28,300
the personality of a candidate of a

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,689
screening test before before using a

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,099
human interviewer

00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:33,099
interview the candidate

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,740
