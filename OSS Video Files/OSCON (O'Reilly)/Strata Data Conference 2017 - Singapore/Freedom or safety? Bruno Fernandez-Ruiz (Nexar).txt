	00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,099
way more so far to date up-to-date has

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:16,010
driven four million miles this is a very

00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:18,650
high spec vehicle the hon slider has

00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:21,650
several cameras is extremely highly

00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,470
equipped they had driven four million

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,019
miles you look at the necks are we drive

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,240
with a smartphone app we driven 100

00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,480
million miles so far and we doing right

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,250
now

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,100
approximately exactly the same per year

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,870
a hundred million miles per year yes we

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,940
only have vision data we don't have a

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,400
lighter and then you look at humans

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,290
humans are leaving a trail back to the

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,330
hundred and twenty billion clicks right

00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,000
that you were accumulating orb

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,710
impressions humans are driving ten

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,670
trillion miles are we capturing that

00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:55,310
datum so when you look in the left as

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,710
way MERS new car it was announced a few

00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,130
days ago it still runs with equipment

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,380
that is not accessible to you and I it

00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,520
only runs with you know a few thousand

00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:11,090
units on test vehicles in the middle you

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,490
have my son's Lego ev3 where he actually

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,399
fitted and connected it to a server tool

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,350
to the obstacle avoidance and it fitted

00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:20,810
these two cameras and on the right you

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,960
have NEX our app so the first on the two

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,240
on the left they are actually high

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,700
fidelity systems why because the data

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,320
they generate is more than they can

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,729
process and they need to store and

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,499
there's no way they can actually use it

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,859
you look at what the lighter produces

00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:39,079
today in terms of data is not able to

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:41,479
actually use it in real-time all of it

00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,579
it has to downsample to be able to run

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,789
models with it you cannot store all the

00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,829
data the ev3 in the middle has two

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:50,960
cameras which is way more powerful than

00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:52,789
what an ev3 can do therefore you have to

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,579
offset it through a network to the cloud

00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:57,319
the next our app will we've done is the

00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,689
opposite we basically said I'm gonna

00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,789
look at those 810 chips that ran on the

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,350
phones I'm gonna look at those 835 it's

00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,420
not drag on that ran on the phone and

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,490
then feed the deep Learning Network to

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,100
run on it and then whatever data is left

00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,750
I move it to the cloud and that's what

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,470
allows us to capture those hundred

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,440
million miles

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,700
it's actually really optimizing for I

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,290
own device

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,120
which leads me to the third point if you

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,100
had a hundred million miles per year if

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,690
you had tens of thousands of hundreds of

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,000
thousands of users driving around the

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,060
world you're actually starting to learn

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,150
from corner cases you're learning about

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,430
snow about a fog you learn about daytime

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,810
nighttime Twilight you learn about

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,000
driving in the desert you're running

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,520
about driving in the cities back to this

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,340
at this this 50% of the casualties

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,010
happen on the road in urban environments

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,070
those 50% of the casualties are actually

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,500
involving cyclists and pedestrians

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:54,450
actually 50% of those type of these

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,170
casualties are happening in Southeast

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,019
Asia and you have from the right which

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,860
is driving in Mountain View driving in

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:09,900
the Bay Area a daytime Missoni day it's

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,120
easy driving in all these 1,400 cities

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,519
in 80 different countries with all these

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,560
weather conditions is hard and there's

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,010
no single automotive company that can do

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,320
that it has to be us the people in this

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,049
room the people in this planet we need

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,030
to drive and collect data which brings

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,920
an issue bigbrother which I'll talk in a

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,739
minute and then the fourth one is

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,820
collaborative management when you drive

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:39,329
when I Drive today we are the kings of

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,610
our little castle which is the car and

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:45,120
we can do whatever we like inside the

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,220
car as we go forward and you look at

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,420
autonomy especially when you have humans

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:54,420
and automatize driving together you

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,970
start having this issue around what

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,900
either robot fails because it will fail

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,090
at some point it's a system and does the

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,160
human take back control if you look at

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,310
what is called level 4 and level 5

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,720
automation the human doesn't take

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,840
control because there's no steering

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,630
wheel in the vehicle so what do we do

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,760
now how do we address the situations one

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,380
of them is to connect those vehicles so

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,150
what you have on the left is what we do

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,100
today which is a forward vehicle

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,320
collision warning in this case there is

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,270
a vehicle behind the corner that we

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,360
don't see and we know that if we

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,270
continue ahead we will hit the vehicle

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,490
she's not a camera it's somebody else

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,900
connecting to us and telling us hey

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,960
Bruno watch out

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,090
something out there you should take that

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,240
into account on the right you have some

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,310
more advanced systems that is basically

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,159
how do you negotiate an intersection

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,409
without a traffic light with all these

00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:53,629
agents are talking to each other the

00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:55,430
reason this is necessary by the way is

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,259
that at any point in the air there are

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,780
ten thousand planes so you can do

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:01,789
centralized air traffic control and any

00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,219
point in the road are 250 million

00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:07,780
vehicles so traffic management as we

00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:07,780
know it is not going to last

00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,309
