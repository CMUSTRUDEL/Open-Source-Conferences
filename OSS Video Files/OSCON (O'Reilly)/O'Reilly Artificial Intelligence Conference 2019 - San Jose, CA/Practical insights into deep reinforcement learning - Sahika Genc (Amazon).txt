Description: 
	Reinforcement learning (RL) is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique that makes short-term decisions while optimizing for a longer-term goal through trial and error. DRL is a subfield of RL that uses deep learning techniques to learn from raw sensor inputs, such as pixels from an image, without feature engineering to extract explicit information such as the borders of objects in an image. The cloud has lowered the barrier to entry through low-cost, highly scalable computing power, making DRL more accessible than ever to data scientists and developers in domains such as robotics, automation, and operations research.
