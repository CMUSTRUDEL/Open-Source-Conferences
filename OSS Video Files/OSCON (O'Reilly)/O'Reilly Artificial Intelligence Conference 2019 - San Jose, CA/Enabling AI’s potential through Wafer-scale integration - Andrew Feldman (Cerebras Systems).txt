The first announced element of the Cerebras solution is the Wafer Scale Engine (WSE). The WSE is the largest chip ever built. It contains 1.2 trillion transistors and covers more than 46,225 square millimeters of silicon. In this talk, we will share some of the details of WSE and discuss its impact on the industry.

not surprisingly over the past five or

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:12,480
six years our industry has built bigger

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:16,470
chips between 2013 and 2019 where we are

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,609
today the size of the chip used in

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:25,590
artificial intelligence increased by 50%

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:29,099
just under 50% 48% it grew from 551

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:34,170
square millimeters to 815 square

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:36,899
millimeters more space a bigger chip

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,270
allows you to put down more cores allows

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:44,430
you to put down more memory we saw this

00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:48,420
and it's three births we thought this

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:53,760
was a good idea so we built the biggest

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,219
chip ever made instead of 815 square

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,510
millimeters we built a chip 46,000

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:04,290
square millimeters instead of having a

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:08,520
billion transistors we have 1.2 trillion

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,150
transistors instead of having a few

00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,780
thousand cores we have 400,000 2 cores

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:20,549
18 Giga bytes of memory 9 petabytes of

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,110
memory bandwidth goes on this is actual

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,759
size well actually it's just a little

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:31,610
bit smaller than this this is a

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:37,590
comparison of our chip and the largest

00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:38,909
GPU at market this is one of my

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,579
favorites lives so we're gonna pause

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:46,939
just for a minute what does that mean in

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,210
terms of these elements that we say

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:56,460
drive performance

00:01:50,210 --> 00:02:00,210
well 78 times more cores 3000 times more

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,229
on chip memory 10,000 times more memory

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,729
bandwidth 133 thousand times more fabric

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:11,989
bandwidth that's what happens when you

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,989
build really really big chips

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,550
