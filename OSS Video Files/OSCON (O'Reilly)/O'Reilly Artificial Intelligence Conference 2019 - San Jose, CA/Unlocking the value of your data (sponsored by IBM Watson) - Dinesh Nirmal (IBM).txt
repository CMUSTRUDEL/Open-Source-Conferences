Description: 
	Organizations recognize that data is what fuels digital transformation and are looking for new ways to unlock the value of their data and accelerate their journey to AI. Thatâ€™s why 80 percent of business leaders view AI as a strategic opportunity. Yet only 19 percent understand the data required for AI. Further, only 1 in 20 AI models make it to production and deliver any ROI. Simply put: There is no AI without information architecture (IA). Dinesh Nirmal examines how, with a unified, prescriptive information architecture, organizations can successfully unlock the value of their data for AI, as well as trust and control the business impact and risks of AI while coexisting in a multicloud world.
