hi Roger McGough Liz here at AI 2019 and

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,280
I'm here with Eric Gardner

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,230
he's Director of Sales enabling the AI

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,730
products group at Intel welcome Eric

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,539
thank you good morning

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,580
ai is such a big complex you know topic

00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,590
to cover what do you think the biggest

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,900
challenge you're facing at Intel right

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,880
now I'd say personally the biggest

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,070
challenge in my role in sales labeling

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,260
is just the onslaught of customers who

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,730
are interested in adopting AI so it's

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,920
the biggest challenge really is time

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,719
management and work-life balance to be

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,129
quite honest so I spend a lot of time

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,199
meeting with customers who are really

00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,210
interested in figuring out how to get

00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:41,339
some of that AI secret sauce in their

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,429
company and also spend a lot of time

00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:45,989
enabling our sales teams to be

00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:48,629
self-sufficient and go off and help more

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,969
customers and scale in that way mm-hmm

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,469
so when you talk to those customers you

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,749
go to the next step like what's the

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,839
first obstacle that they usually need to

00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:59,789
overcome and and what advice can you

00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,219
give them to help achieve what they're

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,719
looking for yeah one of the big first

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,610
obstacles that a lot of customers

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,409
encounter is just the talent gap

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,909
especially in deep learning

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,829
we know that deep learning data

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:12,630
scientists are fairly expensive and

00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:14,009
there's not very many of them so if you

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,380
are going down the deep learning path

00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,729
that poses a challenge so either you

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,670
open the checkbook

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,130
to you know bring people in to outsource

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,329
or if you have the time and what I like

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,880
to recommend is to build up your

00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:28,770
existing developers internally using all

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,689
the great course work on Coursera and

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,670
ranks courses and many others that are

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,890
out there you know Riley maybe even

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,630
though ryley attending conferences

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,520
tutorials lots of great ways to learn

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,430
and the developers that we find are very

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,130
eager to jump in on an exciting new area

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,509
and challenge which is AI mm-hmm

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,210
do you find that they're able to get

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,729
traction the existing developers I do

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,210
yeah and going honestly you know AI is

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,249
is I mentioned is sort of a secret sauce

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,380
there's no rocket science to it really

00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,359
you know it does take a lot of learning

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,270
on the fly and learning as you go to

00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,350
really be attuned tuning all the hyper

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,200
parameters selecting the right

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,759
topologies but we find that developers

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,430
are getting traction through all a great

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,500
training resources they have okay that's

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,300
good to hear and what kind of advice can

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,560
you share about integrating AI into

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,879
existing platforms I think most

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,879
companies that's what they're gonna end

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,980
up doing is trying to get things to work

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,840
in their existing digital presence yeah

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,239
we like to use the analogy of what kind

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,280
of Wi-Fi for a while their Wi-Fi was

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,290
kind of a big deal is a big topic a hot

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,180
topic but an L Wi-Fi is pervasive in

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,879
everything and that's really how we see

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,640
AI going quite frankly a lot of our

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,659
customers who are early adopters of AI

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,280
typically have some analytics

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,319
infrastructure already whether it be

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,030
spark or hoodoo based infrastructure and

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,370
they want to use that existing

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,980
infrastructure and integrate some AI so

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,500
they can add in if it's spark emmelda or

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,790
Big D al libraries that seamlessly

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,349
integrate with that existing

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,790
infrastructure if it's other

00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:58,230
infrastructure and they're using one of

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,170
the popular open source frameworks

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,269
tensorflow MX net PI torch etc making

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,709
sure that they use the Intel optimized

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:06,810
versions of those so that it can get

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,819
actually good performance on their

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,450
existing CPU infrastructure is what I

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,010
recommend mm-hmm so there's a lot that

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,720
you should be doing but there's probably

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,790
a lot of pitfalls and things that you

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,269
should be avoiding what would you say

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,129
about that

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,530
yeah I'd say maybe the biggest pitfall

00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,540
is just given how hot a I is a lot of

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,159
people get the mandate go figure out

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,590
this AI thing bring some of that AI

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,920
secret sauce into our company and boost

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,110
our stock price and in reality when

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,180
customers look at all the opportunities

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:38,579
to solve problems or pursue new

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,099
challenges many of them don't involve

00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:43,439
any IAI whatsoever and those projects

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,150
often deliver the highest ROI they have

00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,430
the most value and of the simplest to

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,590
solve so I'd say go solve those problems

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,840
first pick the low-hanging fruit and

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,239
then you know once you get to the next

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,879
stage down go look at what AI projects

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,239
can really drive the maximum ROI for

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,299
your business so yeah I agree picking

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,459
the right problem and and the right tool

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:07,370
for that problem the things that you

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,599
figure out that AI is one of it is

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,489
ethics fairness bias

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,400
those kind of things what kind of advice

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,320
can you offer to people in factoring

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,389
that into their decisions it's such an

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,280
important part of the process and it's

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,530
one that sometimes overlooked and I like

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,970
to advise customers that you want to

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,550
think about these things up for

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,890
before you dive in with both feet into

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,540
the rabbit hole because if there's

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,790
something in your blind spot from a

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,530
legal ethical social perspective that

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,390
you haven't thought of it's much easier

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,340
to plan for it ahead of time and try to

00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,010
mitigate it than it is once you're in

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,350
the throes of dealing with that problem

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,630
and there's lots of great talks here at

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,510
O'Reilly and a lot of the AI conferences

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,540
in fact online about applying AIA CLE

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,110
and responsibly and to me it's

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,140
super-important we don't want to

00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,540
generate AI algorithms that unfairly

00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,640
advantage or disadvantage certain people

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,260
or that have unintended consequences

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,260
that's great thanks

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,770
