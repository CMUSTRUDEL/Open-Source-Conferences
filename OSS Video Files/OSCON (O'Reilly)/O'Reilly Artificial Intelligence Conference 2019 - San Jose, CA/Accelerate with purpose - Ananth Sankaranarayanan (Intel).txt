Description: 
	Today’s computing hardware has taken us well into the resurgence of AI, but with the demand for AI compute doubling nearly every three months, new ways of computing are required that can keep up and evolve. Ananth Sankaranarayanan discusses three key shifts in the AI landscape—incredibly large models with billions of hyperparameters, massive clusters of compute nodes supporting AI, and the exploding volume of data meeting ever-stricter latency requirements—how to navigate them, and when to explore hardware acceleration.
