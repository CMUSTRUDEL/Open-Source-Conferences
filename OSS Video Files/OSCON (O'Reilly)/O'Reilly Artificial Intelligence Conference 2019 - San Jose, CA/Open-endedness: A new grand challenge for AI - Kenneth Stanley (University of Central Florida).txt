Description: 
	We think a lot in machine learning about encouraging computers to solve problems, but there’s another kind of learning, called open-endedness, that’s just beginning to attract attention in the field. Open-ended algorithms keep on inventing new and ever-more complex tasks and solving them continually—even endlessly.

	00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,720
but open-endedness is a different kind

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,040
of learning and I want to tell you about

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,120
open-endedness because I think it'd be

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,210
really exciting if we could build

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,400
open-ended algorithms and open-ended

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,080
this is not how to learn something like

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,650
how to learn how to do some particular

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,000
task

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,670
it's rather it's really you can think of

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,289
it as how to learn everything so for

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,449
example like a human playing a video

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,890
game is interesting and you know we've

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,660
seen like deep reinforcement learning

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,640
algorithms playing Atari and that's

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,349
interesting but like if you think about

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,580
something like the history of all of

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,940
human invention

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,190
now that is beyond interesting and that

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,500
is in some sense an algorithmic process

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,750
a process that continually increases in

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,450
diversity and complexity without bound

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,370
virtually forever in fact there are a

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,289
number of different kinds of open-ended

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,360
processes that we can observe in nature

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,160
there's the process of human innovation

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,110
which I'm alluding to but also like

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,969
natural evolution for example which is

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,559
not human driven that's also an

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,410
open-ended process it's the ongoing

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,079
creation of all the diversity of life on

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,870
earth and so this is quite an impressive

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,119
process so if you think about open-ended

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,580
processes they're not about like a

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,470
single positive result it's really not

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,740
about any particular result at all it's

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,000
really about surprise like an ongoing

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,830
cacophony of surprises like if you think

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,920
of all of the history of invention over

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,270
time and what's interesting when you

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,409
think about this like if you look at the

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,759
picture like this you say well look at

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,460
all this stuff this took a lot of

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,409
intelligence but it's interesting to

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:32,400
consider you don't have to have human

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,799
level intelligence to do this and yet

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,329
you may need to have this kind of an

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,490
algorithm to get human level

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,130
intelligence so what do I mean by that

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,299
how can you have open endedness without

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,729
solving the problem of human level of I

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,340
hey I will look at this I mean this

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,500
thing here is not from human

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,840
intelligence or human engineering this

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,360
is the Tree of Life and this is a single

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,939
run so to speak of an algorithm called

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,979
evolution which generated all of life on

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,899
Earth this is quite incredible without

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,880
any kind of human intelligence behind it

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,670
and yet here look like right here this

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,340
one little moment in this endless saga

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,920
is human level intelligence actually a

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,070
process that was open and it produced is

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,270
the only example ever to produce

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,910
intelligence at the human level among

00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,160
many many other things so the process

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,020
itself is a process of endless surprises

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,670
we can't really predict where it's going

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,900
to be going in the future and we

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,760
couldn't have predicted where it has

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,230
been and look at the kinds of things

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,490
that it produces along the way like it

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,710
invented all these things like it

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,330
invented photosynthesis and invented the

00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,490
flight of birds it invented of course

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:41,220
intelligence itself all in one single

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,620
run so it just can't be understated just

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,580
how amazing this kind of process is so

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,410
you might call it something like a

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,570
never-ending algorithm because like it's

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,210
been going for like a billion years or

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,250
more and it's not stopping and it's

00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,690
close to maybe as close as we could come

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,690
to something we might call never-ending

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,280
and it's called open-ended evolution so

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,300
it's not like what you some of you might

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,130
have heard of like an evolutionary

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,230
algorithm where that's sort of more like

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:05,430
what we see in typical machine learning

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,930
we say we've got a problem we want to

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,760
solve it let's try to evolve a solution

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,110
for it this is not trying to find a

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,570
particular solution to any particular

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,220
thing this is just finding endless

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,350
things and it basically you could come

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,700
back a billion years later and still be

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,700
surprised at what it's creating

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,510
