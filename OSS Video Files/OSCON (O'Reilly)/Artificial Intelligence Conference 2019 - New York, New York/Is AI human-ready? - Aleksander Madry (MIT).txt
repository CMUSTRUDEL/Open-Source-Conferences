	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,740
one way to summarize this is essentially

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,529
we all are ready for AI you know the

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,090
humanity is ready for AI however the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,010
question that I think we should be

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,840
asking ourselves now the question that

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,809
is actually driving a lot of what I do

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,529
at MIT currently is you know as much as

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,310
we are ready for for AI is AI ready for

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:26,220
us okay what do I mean by that let me

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,740
demonstrate so what you see over here is

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,140
a picture of beautiful Pig so we as a

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,079
humans can tell this is a pig and so can

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,680
state-of-the-art classifier okay so far

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,860
so good

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,020
now when fees get interesting is if I

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,399
add to this picture just a little bit of

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,590
noise it's not a random noise is a

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,710
carefully chosen noise and when I add it

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,469
I will get the picture on the right it

00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,870
still looks like piggy to us everything

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,090
is great but what is interesting is that

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,820
now the same classifier that recognized

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,649
a pig on the left now it is convinced

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,020
this is an airliner with like 99%

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,059
confidence so that so there are two

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,430
lessons here the first one lesson is

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,799
that if you ever wondered hey I is a

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,610
truly magical technology it can makes

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,659
pigs fly

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,610
come on this is impressive but you know

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,350
the other lesson is that this is not

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,990
really what we would expect to happen

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,060
okay and the question you might ask

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,040
yourself now is saying okay is this for

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,780
real you know as I told you the noise I

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,700
have to add to trigger this activation

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,159
is pretty has to be pretty carefully

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,049
chosen so maybe in the real world you

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,640
can't have this kind of fine-grain

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,409
enough control to enable that and

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,350
actually many many people initially

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,110
believed that until a bunch of MIT

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,490
undergrads prove them wrong and what

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,409
they did essentially is they treat the

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,899
printer the turtle that looks like a

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,630
turtle to us but classifies as a rifle

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,000
from almost all the angles okay in all

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,290
the zooms so essentially like if you

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,399
ever wondered if this adversarial

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,680
perturbations are a thing

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,079
well in the they actually are effing and

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,329
the next natural thing to think about is

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,799
okay so you know what can we do about is

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,009
well should we be even worried in the

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,020
first place and well the answer is you

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,849
should and there is many reasons why and

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,679
these main reasons to worry about AI in

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,480
general so the first and the most

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,220
obvious one here is just the security

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,170
okay if I can make my

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,180
system see something different than I

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,850
see that's how all the security breaches

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,730
will restart so indeed you know one of

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,170
the you know compelling users of AI will

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,880
be in the face recognition and you will

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,530
see over here you have a classifier it

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,230
recognizes the the person in the picture

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,450
you know extremely well so everything is

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,340
you know so far so good what is

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,380
interesting is interesting is that the

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,430
moment this person pulls this

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,860
funny-looking glasses

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,410
the AI is convinced is a completely

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,240
different person with high confidence so

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,790
yeah so think about any security system

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,290
with this kind of feature okay but this

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,970
is not really only about security it's

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,220
not not only about the fact where there

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,440
are some bad guys out there that kind of

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,570
tried to get us you know many of the

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,130
applications of AI that we want to like

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,450
that want to have their actually safety

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,280
critical like there are really high

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,130
stakes situations you know here is an

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,410
example and essentially even if there is

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,510
no tampering no malicious tampering the

00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,810
tampering happening just the fact that

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,900
there are some this some inputs that

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,000
kind of look pretty benign but end up

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,040
leading to this kind of results should

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,570
really really worry us and this is by

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,570
far not the only example

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,470
