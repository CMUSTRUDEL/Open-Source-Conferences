	00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:07,980
I'm gonna begin with a talk about the

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,480
meetup group that I organize in New York

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,090
City called women and machine learning

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,330
and data science for short we sometimes

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,550
call it will Diaz and what we do our

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,519
main goal is to build a welcoming and

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:23,400
supportive community for women we are on

00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:25,470
twitter and instagram at women des and

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,269
by the end of the day today will be

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,619
we're very active on twitter will be

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:34,200
hitting pay ten thousand Twitter

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:36,240
followers so our mission is to support

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,620
and promote our official mission is to

00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,270
support and promote women and gender

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,400
minorities and machine learning and data

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,170
science and so I've also added an

00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
artificial intelligence because that's

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,210
just a natural conduit to what comes

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,180
after D s and ml and we are open to

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,560
we're inclusive to anyone any gender is

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:58,410
welcome to join our meetup group about

00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,840
me but Suzanne said I'm a statistician

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,940
I've been organizing for women EES in

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,159
New York for the past four years I'm

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,259
also a board member for women TS and

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,420
what that means is we oversee and

00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:11,999
support the global chapters around the

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,640
world and also a board member of Big

00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:17,069
Apple Pi which runs the annual PI Gothel

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,530
conference in New York City and I'm

00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,729
happy to add that the board of big apple

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,740
pie is 50% men and 50% women and another

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,200
thing I do on the side is I teach get

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,810
workshops in New York City and what that

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,700
does is it advances one of missions I

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,439
have is open source and it advances open

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,670
source accessibility so I'd really like

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,409
you know first of all we'd like to

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,479
acknowledge or ally for their support of

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,289
women D s over the past four years and

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,999
their commitment to diversity Oh Riley

00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:49,590
has community outreach to connect to

00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:51,450
women they're really proactive in

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,880
finding women speakers for all of their

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,179
conferences they offer scholarships and

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,189
travel stipends diversity scholarships

00:01:57,179 --> 00:02:02,939
they've been at the forefront of code of

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,700
conduct implementation and one of the

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,200
things that the O'Reilly conferences do

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,670
is that every time somebody registers

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,039
for a conference they have the option to

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,950
donate some money about five or ten

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,050
dollars to support inclusion focused

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,990
organization

00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,610
such as women TS and they've been doing

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,780
it for all of their conferences and

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,760
we've been the recipients of that

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,770
several times and so you know really

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,290
want to thank them for that and also for

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,020
organizing this diversity luncheon which

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,180
is you know they have it at strata and

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,280
all these other conferences so it's not

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,780
something that I often see with other

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,880
conference conferences okay and so back

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,840
to women ds1 Matias was founded in

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,850
December 2013 in San Francisco we now

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,410
have it's about five and a half years

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,410
since its founding we don't have sixty

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:54,860
three chapters in 27 countries we have

00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,930
29 thousand members 30,000 if we count

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,170
our members on Facebook because some

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:02,810
groups use Facebook more than meet up

00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,520
our board is all us-based because the

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:08,180
first two chapters in New York and San

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,670
Francisco and we have 130 organizers

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,910
that organize events around the world

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,920
and sort of community is is our board

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,900
it's the organizers it's our members

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,360
it's the sponsors it's the companies

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,830
that help host our events and we really

00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,350
want to thank everybody including our

00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,930
supporters on social media and because

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,600
of our expansion around the world our

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,459
next step is to establish an IFC which

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,190
is an infrastructure steering committee

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,080
so we can involve organizers around the

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:41,060
world to really have a say and how when

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,980
will des moods work okay and so the q1

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:49,730
report was just released last Friday and

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:53,390
we are again 27 countries and from this

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,420
map we have two chapters in Australia we

00:03:53,390 --> 00:04:01,100
have one in Tokyo Philippines India has

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:03,080
eight chapters Africa has to force seven

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,230
chapters including Mauritius Egypt the

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,860
Middle East has three Europe is a big

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:16,190
big place for chapters North the u.s.

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:18,739
has 18 18 18 chapters Canada has six and

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,540
South America has four at the these

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,550
slides are going to be made available so

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,590
at the end of the slide I have a link to

00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,570
our q1 report that has much more

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,350
detailed information about where our

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,290
chapters are

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,200
okay and this goes this shows the growth

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:38,050
in 2013 it was the Bay Area chapter 2014

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,210
it was New York nothing happened in 2015

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,020
and then we can see that we had 20 we

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,580
added seven chapters in 2016 5 and 2017

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,220
and then the last two years have just

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,640
seen tremendous growth in terms of

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,100
events

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:59,170
this is 25th 1415 in 2018 we had 184

00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,420
events organized by our chapters around

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,630
the world and you can see here this is

00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,910
2019 it's only April right now right mid

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:10,750
April and we already have 94 events that

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:13,740
have been organized okay and so you know

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,900
what are these events that we organize

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,280
so some one of the things is that we

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,290
want to feature women it's not

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,580
exclusively women speakers but we do

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,260
want to highlight women and have women

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,780
be more positions of speaking at our

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,460
events if there's a panel discussion we

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,520
require that at least 50% of the

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,020
panelists are women and other events

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,169
that we do is we have workshops in

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,880
Python our tensorflow probability we

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,490
have open source prints we have career

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,560
workshops code and coffee hackathons and

00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,960
those are just some examples of the

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,660
types of events that we have to advance

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,030
our mission we also have a job board on

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,600
our website that anyone can post jobs

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,240
for free and so that really you know for

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,040
companies who are looking to have a more

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,840
diverse and inclusive workforce that's a

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,880
place where jobs can be posted so one of

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,690
the things that I want to talk about is

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,520
the open source initiative that we have

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,500
you know we know that in tech the

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,919
percentage of women that work in tech is

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:20,410
quite low and so when we when we go and

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,360
discuss open source Partition women

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,979
participate it's really low it's only

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:31,090
11% and then when we move on to python

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:32,740
it's only 2% and then for people who are

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,229
not familiar with scikit-learn it's the

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,349
machine learning library for python that

00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:40,480
rate is even lower it's 1% it's actually

00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:42,250
less than 1% because

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,340
one woman contributor that's in the top

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,190
100 is not it's not is involved anymore

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:52,390
so there's actually no women in ultimate

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:54,100
and so let's talk a little bit about the

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,240
open source Sprint's that we've had and

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,420
what they are is it's an all-day

00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,040
Saturday event scikit-learn is a library

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,500
on github because it's open source and

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,380
they has over a thousand open issues and

00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,180
so what we've done is in March that the

00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,370
first open source print was organized in

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,920
March the second was in September of

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,990
2018 and there are three more sprints

00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,150
that I am working on organizing for this

00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,450
year there's gonna be a third one in

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,580
August which is going to be it's in New

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,260
York and there's also one thing

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,870
organized in there will be Kenya which

00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,150
has been a lot of fun it's really been

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,610
eye-opening it's also been challenging

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,380
one of the reasons that I am organizing

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,250
the open source written that Roby Kenya

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,830
is it's our fourth largest chapter with

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,630
2,200 plus members so it seems

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,300
reasonable that they should have the

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:44,770
opportunity to have an open source print

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,650
but it's also a different region with

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,440
them you know different resources

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,150
available and for the first time we're

00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,130
having an open source print in San

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,520
Francisco which is our first chapter and

00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:59,290
also our largest chapter and as an aside

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,330
we are looking for sponsors for these

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,330
events and what that entails is

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,340
providing space providing food and there

00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,630
are actually for the hundreds of

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,670
thousands of people that use that

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,590
scikit-learn library there aren't

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,710
actually that many active contributors

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:17,470
to the library probably 20 and so we

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,540
need a contributor to fly to the

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,150
locations to facilitate the sprint and

00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,130
so that is part of the cost that's

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,900
associated with running an open-source

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:32,740
sprint and so founded to speak about

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,550
what other initiatives that we can do to

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,500
improve diversity as a community and so

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:41,440
we all have probably heard the story

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,930
that you know you know men apply for a

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,370
job if they feel 50% qualified whereas

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,430
women wait until they're about 90

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,100
percent feeling qualified and so if you

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,600
know if diversity is an initiative for

00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,080
you one of the things that we can

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,980
consider doing is rewriting

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,080
job descriptions the other thing is we

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,940
know from data that is being published

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,670
out there in the tech world that women

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,700
ask for raises and promotions less often

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:11,060
than men so another way to advance women

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,180
in the industry is to change change the

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,750
game before and be an advocate for them

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,610
and as a example at my last job one of

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,130
the managers there who I did not report

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,839
to directly but had some had another

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,269
statistician reporting to her and

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,070
actually advocated a pay raise for her

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,050
because at that level she knew that the

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,450
women were underpaid at that so she

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,459
advocated for that and then also you

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:38,240
know encouraged me to go and ask for the

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:40,120
race which I did and I received and when

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,470
I've done that if it hadn't been for her

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,779
and the other thing I would say is let

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:49,459
women speak in general and also to

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:51,470
amplify their voices at meetings and so

00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:54,500
what else can we do I think that if you

00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:57,860
follow our Twitter account there's this

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,510
hashtag no medals and what exactly is a

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,910
matter for people who are not sure

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,399
whether panel is a panel discussion

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:07,100
which is oftentimes we see in tech it's

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,130
all men okay and so I think the first

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,829
step in that is to be aware that oh

00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,540
here's the panel which is completely

00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:17,270
homogeneous and how can we make it

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,899
diverse so one thing is first thing is

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:23,000
just being aware and if you are in the

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:25,910
fortunate position to be invited to

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,620
speak on a panel just be aware the COO

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,589
else is speaking you know what are the

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,810
who are the other speakers is a diverse

00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:35,060
I think it's also important to be aware

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,670
that progress and careers and

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,339
opportunities also take place outside of

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,279
the workplace so it's not just what

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,050
happens at the desk or at a meeting it's

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,630
it's the socialization that goes on

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,410
outside and all I would say is just to

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,899
be aware of that and to mentor and

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,570
sponsored employees from

00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,160
underrepresented groups and finally you

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,100
know something that's really important

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,020
is a code of conduct is what we hear but

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,600
it's also you know the mission and the

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,000
rules and the legalities of a

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,270
corporation

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,710
we know that they're there I think we

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,380
also know that sometimes they're not

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:16,360
always there in writing maybe they're

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,090
not always implemented and I think it's

00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,130
important that we create a safe and

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,980
welcoming environment for all people by

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:29,110
actually implementing a code of conduct

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,730
and the last slide in terms of what we

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,320
can do is to have the difficult

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,640
conversations that if there's something

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,370
that's happening that is uncomfortable

00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,680
to be able to speak to someone and talk

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,250
about it I actually had an interaction

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,140
with somebody in an open-source

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,640
community what I thought the person was

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:52,060
not being particularly professional and

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:56,170
nice and so I gave the feedback which

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,840
was a defensive response and before we

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,670
had a longer conversation I took out my

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,250
Crucial Conversations book which I read

00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,650
last summer I read it again and then had

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,500
the conversation so it's not easy to

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,320
have these conversations but you know

00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:16,270
there are resources out there that can

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,820
help um the other thing is surveys so

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,170
you know people we talk about diversity

00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,880
and it's like how do we measure

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:26,440
diversity we we have to have

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,850
measurements right there's a saying out

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,130
there we cannot understand what we

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,760
cannot measure I'm also a statistician

00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:36,160
so I'm pretty big on numbers too but if

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,900
we don't have the data over time to see

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,850
how things are happening then it's

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,760
difficult to assess what we're doing and

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,740
what the improvements are and so what I

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,750
would say is I know that you know with

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,580
O'Reilly this conference they asked an

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,190
optional question at the end you know

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,870
what is your gender and this is

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,580
something that's been eye-opening for me

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,000
in the past that would maybe not fill

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,290
out a survey thinking ah another survey

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,710
but understanding what the greater

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:06,190
implications of that are I am much more

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:08,800
cognizant of it so you know if you can

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,890
like in terms of gender diversity to

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,120
fill out those surveys it's helpful you

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,339
know one of the discussions that's

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,530
happening in data science is they don't

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,790
necessarily know for instance an open

00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,220
source they don't know exactly how

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,350
what the gender breakdown is the men and

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,980
women so they look at avatars and games

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,810
and make estimates and then there's then

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,030
there's criticism saying this is not

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,430
accurate you can't use that right but

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,140
there's actually no data uh so you know

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,190
as a stats question I would say we start

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,740
with something we start with the

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:42,830
baseline and learn from that but if you

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,290
can contribute to accurate data please

00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,930
consider the reason why it's being

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:53,330
collected even though it may be a

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:55,100
sensitive issue and so some final

00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:57,380
thoughts that I have about it is I know

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,570
sometimes people you know one of the

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,730
questions that people ask is I'm not a

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,610
I'm not sure what to do I'm not sure how

00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,500
to support I you know I I might make a

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,390
mistake I might say the wrong thing and

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,200
one of the things that when I share is

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:16,730
even as a group focused on supporting

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:20,450
women that is over five years old we are

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,400
learning a lot that that you'd be

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,800
surprised you know we used to call it

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,990
women and non-binary and somebody on

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,720
Twitter pointed out listen when you say

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,120
that you've just excluded trans trans

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,280
men because they're not non-binary they

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,860
identify as men but they are a minority

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,680
and so we have changed our nomenclature

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,410
to women and gender minorities in terms

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,180
of who we're highlighting the other

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,070
thing I would say it's for women TS is

00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,960
we implemented a code of conduct less

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,080
than two years ago and these codes of

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,370
conduct have been around for much longer

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,260
there were some behaviors that went on

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,670
and our meet up with which we continued

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,130
I would say for a little too long

00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,990
and so you know we're I would say we're

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,840
a bit behind and I'm glad that you know

00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:06,080
it's implemented and another example is

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:08,120
a very odd chapter so we as I said you

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,990
know we have 24 new chapters just in the

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,820
q1 of 2019 and so our process is

00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,950
somebody inquires about be getting a

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,990
chapter we send them a link to our

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,680
starter kit and ask them to agree to our

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,910
terms which is its non-commercial agenda

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,640
will you organize at least one event

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,140
every six months and that and so people

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,790
write back and they agree to the terms

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,890
and then we write back and say okay do

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,670
you want to send us your photo and a bio

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,430
which we can add to a Reb

00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,730
so our work and I saw for the Riyadh

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,280
Saudi Arabia chapter wrote back and said

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:44,640
I can't send you a photo because I wear

00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,920
a veil is it ok if I send you an icon

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:49,260
we're like yes sure but you know this is

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,940
like an example of our baseline is of

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,580
course you don't just expect people to

00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:57,150
send a photo without consideration and

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:00,990
so we learn to know we're learning along

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:03,240
the way and so and then the last thought

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:07,470
I had about my comment about the pie

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:11,520
will get bigger is you know for if there

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:13,950
is any concern that oh if I support

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,920
diversity that there will be less for

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,050
this one group and more for another we

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,750
know that having particularly in the

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,360
United States with such a heterogeneous

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:28,200
society that having more people involved

00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:32,880
only makes the pie bigger so to consider

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:34,440
that and so what I have some calls for

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,940
action the first is if you'd like to

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,700
sponsor women a machine learning data

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,940
science you can post jobs on our job

00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,800
boards so it can reach those 30,000

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,390
numbers and it's available to the public

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,880
so it reaches people who are not even

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,970
remembers that's fine follow us on

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,300
social media if your city doesn't have a

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,190
whim LDS chapter you can be gone one and

00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,310
actually at that table over there we

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,110
have three other organizers - from women

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,360
des and one from PI ladies so if you

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,980
have any questions about our meetup

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,900
groups in general about how to start a

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,819
chapter or anything else we're over

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,110
there after the presentation so feel

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:15,449
free to stop by and you know even

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:17,699
outside of my organization if you run

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,339
any organization whether it's you know

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,860
if it's a baseball group or soccer group

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,319
or tennis group or a church group or

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,740
anything I'm considering that a code of

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,330
conduct is really really helpful for you

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:31,830
know sort of watching behavior and

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,010
creating this environment that's create

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,050
that's inclusive and diverse I know with

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,070
my meetup group for years we didn't have

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,110
a code of conduct

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,610
I observed behavior that I didn't think

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,809
was appropriate but I didn't know how to

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,249
address it

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:46,139
then once the code of conduct was

00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:47,669
implemented it was very easy to say oh

00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:49,409
yes this is this is really not an

00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,620
alignment with our code of conduct so it

00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:53,909
was very helpful so again you know we're

00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,240
over at this table if you have any

00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:59,669
