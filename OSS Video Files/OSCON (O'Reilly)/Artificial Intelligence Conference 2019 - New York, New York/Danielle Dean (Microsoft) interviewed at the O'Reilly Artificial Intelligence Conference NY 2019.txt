hi I'm Paco Nathan with O'Reilly Media

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,430
and we're here at the O'Reilly

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,529
artificial intelligence conference in

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,660
New York City and it's a pleasure today

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,580
to be joined by Danielle Dean who's

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,110
principal data scientist at Microsoft

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,330
awesome thanks for having me

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,190
welcome pleasure to be here thank you I

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,189
really enjoyed the keynote thank you oh

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,260
that's really fun so for some questions

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,930
here what are the what are some of the

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,439
biggest challenges in making a solutions

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,330
real in enterprise yeah so there's been

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,759
tremendous progress in AI it's super

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,550
exciting but making AI real is still

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,200
tough the first problem is you have to

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,460
translate business problems into data

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,230
science problems and make sure that

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,550
there's actually match between the the

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,730
business problem and the data science

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,440
problem data scientists do still need to

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,239
understand the domain and the domain

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,070
experts still need to give relevant

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,600
information to the data scientists they

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,370
can build out that end-to-end solution

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680
trying to figure out not just how to

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,000
create the best model at low latency but

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,230
how is it actually going to be used in

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,239
enterprise and making sure there's a

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,620
good end-to-end solution so there can be

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,960
some challenges there and making that

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,600
real another challenges it's the space

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,340
is moving so fast it's crazy there's new

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,080
technology out all the time there's new

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,460
hardware out all the time what do you

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,930
take advantage of when do you change

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,369
when do you double down and decide

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,290
you're gonna stick to that type of

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,850
technology and platform so there's a lot

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,729
of decisions that need to be made and

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,890
some of that makes AI difficult to do in

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,700
production and enterprise scenarios I

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,189
can imagine

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,990
also I can imagine your team gets to see

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,030
a real breadth of different types of

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,280
business use cases yeah yeah so my team

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,380
in specifically works within product

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,850
engineering in Azure and we work with a

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,439
lot of different customers in all

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,420
different industries trying to make AI

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,250
real and then what we do is we take that

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,960
and we bring that back to the product to

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,909
improve the product and I think there's

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,740
one of the things that we're trying to

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,680
do with the product is help enterprises

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,149
make AI solutions more scalable more

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,860
manageable because there is so much

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,420
change going on but you need to manage

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,149
models you need to be able to deploy

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,380
them quickly and so helping take the

00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,729
customer learnings and bring them into

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,729
the projects is a really fun role to

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:06,290
play fantastic how do you build

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,600
professional data science and AI teams

00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,420
yeah details on that yeah so building an

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,800
AI team is really fun experience because

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,590
people can come from very different

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,080
backgrounds which i think is amazing and

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,760
I think building a team with incredible

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,290
diversity not just diversity and things

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,480
like gender and race but diversity and

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,640
backgrounds and experiences is really

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,350
important thinking about different ways

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,090
to solve problems so I think that's a

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,770
really key thing and building out data

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,850
science teams is what types of

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,350
backgrounds people have in having

00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:35,240
complementary skills you're never gonna

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,800
find somebody that can do everything in

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,840
an AI solution right you need these

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,340
different types of experiences people to

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,200
build out data of PARs complete that

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,240
models the domain experts the business

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,950
experts to make these solutions real so

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,290
I think that's a really key point and

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,700
then when you're building up a data

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,140
science solutions building an

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,090
environment that people can really learn

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,040
from each other take advantage of the

00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,770
change and really accelerate I think

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,450
it's important I've seen mentoring be

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,890
such an important thing work people yeah

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,390
that kind of environment what people can

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,730
learn from each other continuously yes

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,680
yes and learn learn and also be able to

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,209
fail fast yeah because this is a field

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,980
where we need to try things a lot of

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,709
times they don't succeed so building

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,420
that environment where people feel

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,190
comfortable to fail fast and move on and

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,860
then eventually succeed wonderful

00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,720
important what are some things to

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,390
consider when you're designing

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,100
applications to use AI so I think one of

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,780
the most important things which people

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,489
often forget is how is the model

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,830
couldn't be used okay seems very

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,290
straightforward but oftentimes we get

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,060
lost in this is our business problem and

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,739
this is this is an interesting way we

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,390
could formulate the problem so they

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,370
don't think through when you actually

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,810
have the result how is they can affect

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,280
the rest of the flow how are you gonna

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,500
capture data back how are you going to

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,030
improve does it are you going to take

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,470
actions based on the model that's gonna

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,930
then change the underlying business

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,820
process and so basically the end and

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,010
flow I think is something very important

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:58,310
to consider but but those kinds of

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:00,080
downstream interactions are hard to

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,690
anticipate they are hard to anticipate

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,660
so you have to think through and think

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,670
iteratively okay and be able to again

00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,530
the fail-fast concept where try things

00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,970
understand the end to end and then go

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,700
back and improve the individual pieces

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,680
because if you spend too much optimizing

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,419
too much time optimizing one part you

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,719
may not actually get to the business

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:23,270
that you're looking for just how is

00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,889
Microsoft helping to develop the data

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,509
science and a community

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:30,889
yes Microsoft's been doing a lot of

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:32,539
stuff in AI for decades about all this

00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,719
stuff even in Microsoft research that

00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:37,819
has been happening but I think most

00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:39,379
close to that point is around tools to

00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,389
help data scientists and developers

00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:43,400
really manage their data science

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,810
workflows and do that faster so how do

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,120
you do things like manage all your

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,979
Python dependencies and deploy models

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,930
easier how do you take advantage of the

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,960
latest hardware and scale out really

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,430
easily how do you take the code that

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,479
you're doing on your local laptop and

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,000
take advantage of the cloud without

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,139
having to do a lot of things in between

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,599
so I think a lot of the work is on

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,490
leveraging what's available in the open

00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,319
source and helping people do that in a

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,029
more efficient way more cost-effective

00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,000
way and really scaling out what they're

00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:13,129
able to do just in my own use of

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,870
Microsoft tooling especially in this

00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:17,779
area it seems like the tools are very

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,279
accessible to approach and get with but

00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:21,529
then there's also there's a lot of scale

00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,389
I mean you start out maybe with a small

00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,539
problem that you can go very large very

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,979
yeah yes absolutely it's important to

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,169
take the also the different target

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,699
audiences into account so there's a lot

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,500
of stuff that's been happening in the

00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,029
cognitive services space so a lot of

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,490
pre-trained models that are available

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:39,529
like machine translation models for

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,389
instance where people are able to take

00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,460
that developers who may not even know

00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,810
how to do too much in the AI space and

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,539
leverage that within their application

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,279
then also the services that enable data

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,620
scientists to scale out what they're

00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,089
doing is is more and more of that coming

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,620
out of research I mean I know you're

00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:58,460
using a lot of open source but I imagine

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,589
those yeah huge yeah yeah it's

00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,849
definitely a mixture both so the open

00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,620
source community and what's available

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:04,759
there but then also Microsoft research

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,819
she's been doing a ton of stuff

00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,430
especially in speech and vision machine

00:06:07,819 --> 00:06:11,960
translation type areas Oh fantastic they

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,770
cued in oh yeah thank you so much you'll

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,770
