	00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:04,259
it's exciting to be here this morning

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,609
everybody said their coffee I have a

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:07,500
unique opportunity to talk with

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,760
customers all around you know all around

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,349
the country and all around the planet

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,690
around what they're doing from an AI

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,580
perspective and how they're architecting

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,960
and building that architecture to you

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,150
know just start off with their journey

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,550
or to you know really accelerate kind of

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,710
where they are in their journey one of

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,359
the things that I really think about and

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,910
you know spent the last couple of weeks

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,070
really kind of working through it is how

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,510
how much artificial intelligence is not

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,940
only impacting all of us in this room

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,370
but what about the next generation so I

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,140
have a 16 month old and he loves this

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,370
show called little baby bum so if

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,350
there's any parents in the room they've

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,420
probably seen seeing the show and if you

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,190
haven't it's basically just Nursery

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,079
Rhymes that are cartoons or they're fun

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,129
to watch and you continue to watch them

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,809
over and over but he'll what Tommy will

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,610
do is he'll run and he'll anytime he

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:54,809
wants to watch it he'll grab a remote

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,730
and he'll start up and he'll start

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,230
trying to change change the channel

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,480
right and if it doesn't work and his

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,129
favorite show doesn't come on I saw him

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,539
the other day he started talking into it

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,489
I was like wait a minute he's 16 months

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,020
old he's talking into it and he can't

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:08,850
even talk like he says like five words

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,650
and so what he's trying to do is he's

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,500
seen his older sister and he's seen his

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,900
parents talking to the remote or talking

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,310
to things and make it go and do the

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,080
things that they want to do and so I

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,759
just think that's amazing when you think

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,130
about how it's impacting the next

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,170
generation but if you look at it too I

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,850
mean he's still going through that and

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,799
it's taken him 16 months to get there

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,960
and he still hasn't even perfected but

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,909
the architectures and the models that

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,619
we're building right now we can do we

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,299
can do overcome that and do that in

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,579
weeks or months and so if you just think

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,770
about it I mean that's totally changing

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,299
the way the next generation is I mean

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,970
from my perspective I remember as a kid

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,840
I can still tell you that channel 33 was

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,490
MTV or Channel 17 was ESPN right I mean

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,509
we all we all in this room probably

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,920
remember having to do that

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,479
but that's something that's a concept

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,490
that the next generation is not even

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,530
gonna have to have and so when you think

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,149
about how much it's impacting and the

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,130
things that are changing but that's just

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,810
one little aspect right you know what

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,579
about in medical research and all and a

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,259
lot of the other places we're really

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,289
pushing it in the financial market so

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,760
I'm excited to be here to talk and to be

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,200
able to interact with everybody and talk

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,930
about how we can build architectures

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,840
that can kind

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:20,140
speed up the AI revolution that we're

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,660
seeing and also too at Dell technologies

00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,849
we have a very special guest all the way

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,290
from Hong Kong today who will be at our

00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,250
booth we're doing a special event

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,900
tonight

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,660
but make sure you come by and see our

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,340
booth Sofia the robot so she is a

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,379
celebrity whenever we talk about robots

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,670
but she's here to talk about all the

00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:38,110
things that are possible when we talk

00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,090
about artificial intelligence and so

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,739
she'll be at our booth here in the next

00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,000
30 minutes to be able to come and talk

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,680
and you'll be able to interact with her

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,239
and ask her questions and really you

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,579
know find some of us to talk about

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,079
what's going on in the future of

00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,290
artificial intelligence and how you can

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:54,459
build those architectures to really

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,290
accelerate and really do what you do

00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,480
best as far as data science right and

00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,250
leave the infrastructure to us to help

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,750
you speed speed that up so I hope

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,519
everybody will come and join us come

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,220
feel free to come by you know get a

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,260
selfie with Sofia and come in here hear

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,910
her talk about artificial intelligence

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,910
in the future of AI thank you

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,900
