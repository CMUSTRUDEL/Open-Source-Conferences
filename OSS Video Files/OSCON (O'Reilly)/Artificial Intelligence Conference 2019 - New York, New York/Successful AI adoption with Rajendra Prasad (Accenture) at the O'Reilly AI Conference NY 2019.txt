hi my name is Paco Nathan and we're here

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,819
at the O'Reilly artificial intelligence

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,760
conference in New York City

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,070
it's a pleasure today to be joined by

00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,809
Rajendra Prasad who is the senior

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,360
managing director and global automation

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,529
lead at eccentric vagenda that good nice

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,490
meeting you very good to meet you at

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:24,050
ergo21 question what are the challenges

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:28,279
for implementation for a successful AI

00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:30,840
adoption strategy so we've been doing AI

00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,000
conversations VI implementation CI

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,880
discussions with lots of our clients and

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,219
the technology organizations one of the

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,829
biggest challenge that they all talk to

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,079
me when I speak to them is they first

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,600
get really excited with this you know

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,020
new Ness of the i/o and then say let's

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,270
try it out but then they try to do use

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,170
case by use case one use case here one

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,449
use case there

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,120
I didn't or a period of time they have

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,910
built the silos of AI implementation

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,219
there's some gone to some for some just

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,339
in the initial stages I call it as

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,340
building a silo implementations within

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,030
an enterprise not having a holistic view

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,130
of AI implementation so my biggest

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,220
suggestion our advice to most of the

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,790
leaders that who I speak to is do not do

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,650
yai if VI is not required okay you know

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,280
understand what's your business

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,490
challenges and do not build this silo

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:35,040
based yeah adoption approaches and build

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,579
a holistic approach wonderful this kind

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,700
of work architecting ai does this need

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:44,840
rethinking from more conventional

00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:47,399
architectural approaches absolutely see

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,070
what a period of time we know that the

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,290
technology of the AI datte assigns all

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,530
of that exists for a long period of time

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,180
however we you know last few years we

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,250
have got a lot of development

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,790
improvements and logging happening

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,590
I will I come from software engineering

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,290
background you know software engineering

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,570
has a very traditional discipline

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,000
approach be it a traditional waterfall

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,610
development or Nigel development kind of

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,459
concepts so what we have been done very

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,190
successfully talking to our IT leaders

00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,440
and systems leaders and the technologies

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,370
in the business users who responsible

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,100
for AI is to embed what I call in the

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,890
discipline and the methodology aspects

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,160
of software engineering and drive that

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:37,950
with an engineering mindset in AI let me

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,270
take a simple example right if you want

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,760
to run AI using an agile development how

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,760
do you define Sprint's within AI

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,100
development or B data curation data

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,130
consumption take a capture data

00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,260
harvesting great analysis any aspects of

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,790
the data that you want to do what's your

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,920
sprint do you want to do all of them in

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,530
a sequence or do you want to do each of

00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,840
those is a different Springs and how do

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,900
you approach that I tomorrow i will be

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,209
also talking about micro services as an

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,209
aspect within AI how you apply that

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:15,000
they've ops you know the new concepts of

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,590
dev and ops together running to the run

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,810
off run part of the I

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,989
all of these software engineering

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,110
principles can do a better handshake

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,630
with the eye and then that's what I call

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,360
as applying you know looking at the eye

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,840
development in a slightly different lens

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,450
and applying more proven if I can say is

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,360
software engineering techniques on Ti so

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,070
in a sense it sounds like taking these

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,230
notions which are well-known in

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,760
engineering and the value of this and

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,590
eventually you're going to have to cross

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,510
that bridge anyway correct taking those

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,200
principles and moving them in rewriting

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,450
them into oh very good

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,579
how about the value realization from

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,980
implementations of the eye let you track

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:01,840
that absolutely so we have a we have

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,890
created a concept called yeah I

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,000
Vallot okay okay the way we asked our

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:10,150
implementation teams and the people the

00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,090
engineers who takes the I use cases here

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,900
aspects to the field is to identify up

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,570
front

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,290
what's the effort what's the business

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,960
benefit army behind speed to market are

00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:27,280
we behind cost optimization are we

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,430
behind customers experience and if you

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,639
convert that into an equivalent cotton

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,470
coat dollar value how much of that you

00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,229
are going to deposit into this value

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,160
valid and we have a segmentation by

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:42,639
automation

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,620
yai data analytics data science aspect

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,560
and you measure the value around that

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,350
and as you go through that the you know

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,050
you the investments into AI has to

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,960
offset the value that you put in then

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,900
you start making profitable yeah I if I

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,310
can say okay fantastic so starting out

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,930
though understanding that contrast of

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,669
where the organization is currently

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,070
versus where they could be correct

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:08,020
interesting and you know that's a very

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,750
good point because what the way I say if

00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,419
you if you know the one of the quality

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,490
Korean what's hands-free he says that if

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,830
you do not know on a map where you are

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,780
and that won't help you right right so

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,140
an important aspect of this value

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,020
realization and value creation is to

00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,919
make sure that you kind of identify

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,919
where you are

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,410
put the AI use cases and most

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,050
importantly always remember if it is not

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,880
required to be I doesn't need to VI

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,789
right it can be a simple automation

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,620
solution and that's cannot drive the

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:43,660
value generation and then the key to

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,979
this holistic view absolutely get a

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,840
holistic wonderful what you see or

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,729
rather how do you see the future

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,520
workforce transforming though with

00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,840
respect to to this AI revolution that's

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,789
going on have you ever seen in the

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,090
keynote presentations today in the

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:02,320
morning one of the biggest challenge for

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,060
the I

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,310
mmunity as we move forward we'll be

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,810
creating the community and the expertise

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,300
competencies skill dictionary that is

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,890
required for AI and it was very

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,650
interesting stats that I saw in the

00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,940
morning so one of the things that we do

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:25,420
in the organization is we focus very

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,850
specifically to build AI skills I call

00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,400
we have a pyramid of AI expertise

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:34,900
building at the bottom of it I call it

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,570
as AI prime our data prime data

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,190
scientist or a data expert prime it is

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,560
very simply two to three years of

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:45,040
experience you pick up a specific

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,130
technique like DL the NLL P R you know

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,260
if you want to do data science

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,750
particularly descriptive prescriptive

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,870
predictive or you know regression models

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,930
as you know one specific area but build

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:03,010
a deep expertise in that area okay and

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:05,680
then once you do that you kind of build

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,050
some algorithms of models and then you

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,530
go to the next level which is called AI

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,500
architect then you architect a solution

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,300
that can actually seamlessly fit into

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,780
the ecosystem of the technology

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,870
landscape of an enterprise and then you

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,690
graduate to VI coach okay I mean you can

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,600
then identify the use cases the value

00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,610
valid aspects of it where you are are

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,580
also taking the deep expertise you built

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,880
in each of those areas and then

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,700
finally you becoming a champion we build

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,790
this carrier model very consciously and

00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:44,520
we drive all our workforce employees

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,130
through this to get graduated through

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,930
that and we give them you know

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,700
certifications and we recognize them we

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:53,610
capture their competency and

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,740
proficiencies within the system so that

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,080
they can actually build a roadmap of

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,420
learning across the data science across

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,940
the AI across the software engineering

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:05,520
bringing all three aspects together and

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,100
then be able to deliver in a efficient

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,650
and effective and with the focus of user

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,570
experience and customer experience

00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,280
impacting business experience fantastic

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,320
this is building the individual but also

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,110
building the organization and in the

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,660
media age I call it the organizational

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,330
talent fabric that we built and that's

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,600
the AI fabric and very conscious effort

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,520
very conscious investment learning you

00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,530
know being part of the community like

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
the one that we are in last two days and

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,880
next two days we're going to be in the

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,350
sessions this is an important aspect of

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,500
building that expertise you know our

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:43,080
organization fantastic what are some of

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,630
the practical tips or considerations in

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,510
terms of implementing AI at scale in

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,540
enterprise so the very when whenever we

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,330
approach AI it is like a big change

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,400
effort right once you get through the

00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,860
you know yes it is good it's interesting

00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,350
it's fancy it's new thing then when you

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,020
get to the reality you need to drive

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,800
change within the organization you have

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,470
to it is like any technology change that

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,460
we managed in the past starting from you

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,560
know computers to data to AI to you know

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,480
the you know every time summation that

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
we have seen like change management what

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,170
are the three key aspects of change

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,960
management people process and technology

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,300
in my view technology is easy because

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,920
you can learn ml you can learn deep

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,720
learning you can learn neural networks

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,390
you just have to learn it so much

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,100
open-source absolutely and process you

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,800
can define the business processes

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,629
development processes and tell P

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:44,249
that this is the process what's the

00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:48,230
toughest part people building a constant

00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:51,059
AI expertise change management program

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,749
co-opting them I call it as being it's

00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:57,119
applying in a very simple steps you know

00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:59,759
identifying you know where it makes

00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:03,029
immediate impact does this use case

00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,819
really make an impact can I apply simple

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,339
discipline like micro-services data

00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:11,730
engineering then you make without

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,619
disturbing your Enterprise ecosystem of

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,160
technology then building the people

00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:18,989
capability then continuously in putting

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,420
the innovation back into the system

00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:24,389
right so it's like a cycle so I called a

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,670
simple seamless scalable and sustainable

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:29,970
approach you have to go through those

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,579
steps make it simple don't interrupt the

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,170
technology ecosystem and then scale it

00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:36,839
by involving everybody in the

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,670
organization creating a talent fabric

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,279
within the organization then put up a

00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,649
mechanism where you can get continuous

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,170
innovation back into the operation that

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:50,059
fit not fantastic thank you sir thank

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,059
