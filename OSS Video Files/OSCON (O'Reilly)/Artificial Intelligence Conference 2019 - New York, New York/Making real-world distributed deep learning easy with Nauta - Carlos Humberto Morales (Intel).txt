right so what is not as specifically

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:08,309
it's it's a multi node multi user deep

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,650
learning training platform right we're

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,480
not really focused on inference it's

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,080
open source we open source it back in

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,089
January

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,670
it's kubernetes native from the ground

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,800
up and it's based on a lot of key flow

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,350
components so it interacts with cue flow

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,510
quite well since we had the chance of

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,810
redesigning this thing right based on on

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,630
our learnings we set out with some

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,850
design principles first we made it

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,100
minimal right don't do anything that you

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,989
don't have to do so we've been working

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,510
with data scientists for years now 2015

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,370
time frame we know how they work wait

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,520
didn't fight 13 things that they have to

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,710
do day after day and we did that nothing

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
else and it's hard as an engineer you

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,949
always want to do more you want to add a

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,539
feature or whatever it was hard to keep

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,420
that the other important thing that we

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,039
did was because we knew that our users

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,350
were not just a data scientist they were

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,059
the DevOps teams the IT teams they're

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,939
gonna be deploying this we made it high

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,890
quality and high quality means we have a

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,700
dedicated QA team which is kind of rare

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:13,650
in the open source space and over 400

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,030
tests it goes up every day so I feel

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,330
comfortable saying 400 Rispoli

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,650
closer to 500 now that's a huge deal

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,390
that means a service integrator or an

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,939
ISV can can take this thing and produce

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,200
products you help the data scientist

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,509
that's another design principle don't

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,549
get in their way the first two was we're

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,500
very opinionated about how we did things

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,670
this one we said we're not going to get

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,280
in the way if you want to do things

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,729
directly but kubernetes you can and also

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,290
help the DevOps team very important and

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,470
finally come on there you go don't

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,630
reinvent so another engineering thing is

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,540
oh that little knob over there is not

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,630
quite right let's make it better knob

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,119
but you know community efforts like you

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,750
Flo are really coming along and

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,820
producing a lot of interesting

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,920
technology so we steal from I mean we

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,060
borrow from from them

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,700
we leverage open-source come okay

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,080
for example the they just came out cue

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,760
flow just came out with ml pipelines we

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,080
had a pipeline internally we use it we

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,130
were planning to build a feature around

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,130
they're like no we'll use that

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,260
