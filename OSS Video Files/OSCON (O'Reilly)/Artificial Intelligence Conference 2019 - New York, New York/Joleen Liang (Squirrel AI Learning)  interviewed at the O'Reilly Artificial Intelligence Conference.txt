hi I'm parka Nathan with O'Reilly Media

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,759
and we're here at the O'Reilly

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,799
artificial intelligence conference in

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,700
New York City and it's a pleasure to be

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:15,120
joined with Jolene Liang from squirrel

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,809
AI learning there good to meet you too

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,010
thank you

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,430
I really enjoyed your keynote this

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,550
morning thank you so much fantastic okay

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,090
first question what makes squirrel AI

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:31,439
learning unique and be able to develop

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:35,610
it at such a high speed as as an AI

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,579
unicorn education munivar sure actually

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,530
there are two key features and the first

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,030
one of course is gonna be the AI

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,879
technology so we do we have very top AI

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,600
tailings from the word helping us build

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,270
this AI platform so we have Professor

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,430
Tom Mitchell from Carnegie Mellon

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,359
University is the attention of computer

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,590
science department and also we have many

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,000
professors working with us to enjoin

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,310
research project and our platform is

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,040
spewed up with over I think 20

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,159
algorithms and we do have other like a

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,930
world world first invented techniques

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:22,530
such like MKC which is nano scale

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:25,530
knowledge point components and we do the

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,159
route treating system which means the

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,560
system can track back to sixth grade or

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,390
fourth grade of the knowledge components

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,290
that students have not mastered at that

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,520
time yep and we do have other projects

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,000
with a Stanford Research Institute

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,630
undergoing is called a human machine

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
interface and me bus system which is me

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,070
Matsumoto interpreted behavior analysis

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,130
so we have combination of all sorts of

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,900
like technology and really top AI

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,410
talents

00:01:53,900 --> 00:02:00,950
the word so can help us to build this I

00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:03,950
can't say perfect platform yet but we

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:07,400
are trying to yes and that's been within

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,060
the space of four years that's like four

00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,310
and half years ago which is 2014 and we

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,430
spent about almost three years to build

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,280
this platform and to end of 2014 and

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,700
early seventeen we started launching our

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,530
platform to the market yesterday what

00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,130
would be what would you say is the the

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:33,830
main driver then for for that that rapid

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,990
success I think is our team the Cole you

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,760
know co-founders and founders we have

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:40,430
the mission to really change the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,620
education because most of us will not me

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,230
most of us have been in education

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,490
industry for almost 20 years everything

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,350
yeah we know the big difficulties of

00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,750
Education well in traditional way of the

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,520
education in China and of course we know

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,800
that this is the same thing everywhere

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,770
in the world right we really want to

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,440
change this situation and we know that

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,480
some companies like Newton Alex

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,130
they were adaptive learning companies

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,670
like 20 years ago they are pretty good

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,400
in us and we want you to do the similar

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,590
things but we do have big differences

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,790
that we do have our own contents where

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,890
they don't really

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,079
their own and they have their very good

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,290
platform and we do it and also we have

00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,879
services to help the students to service

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,189
as a part of students and the parents

00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,170
all the time right I saw that from the

00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,659
keynote there is there is a real human

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,329
component to this also a large part

00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:38,390
automation but then up to 30% was it

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,069
that's the human component yes yes 70%

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,620
of students learn from the AI children

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,659
and 30% there's a human coach always

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,180
there for good we are human beings right

00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:49,670
we can't really face robot all the time

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,760
24 hours so there will be a human

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,400
theater yes so the whole team we have

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,470
you know the passion of changing the

00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,840
education world so we definitely want to

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,689
do that and our founder Derek he's a

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,760
serial entrepreneur as well and his

00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:09,439
previous company was called only

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,450
education was the first IPO yeah a share

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,669
market in China I mean the first

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,090
education company which was very hard at

00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:20,260
that time so he has thoughts of pageanty

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:22,729
he has he knows how to do like Internet

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,449
education long time ago and he wants to

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,169
use AI to make education eco yeah for

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:30,530
all the students

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:33,199
excellent excellent oh what specific

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,949
types of AI technologies have have come

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,539
in dennis you've been building squirrel

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,389
adaptive learning is the main one okay

00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:43,400
yeah adaptive so the system can be

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:46,010
adaptive to each different student based

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,740
on their different situation the

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,380
real-time data and feedback and well

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,409
right and wrong answers is one key

00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,750
factor and also the behavior they they

00:04:54,409 --> 00:05:00,680
move their mouse and the time the speed

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:02,750
and like the pressure they have and

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,900
blood pressure and I guess II really

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,460
interest ya their concentration but the

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,560
main one is that

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,949
learning yes some algorithmic technology

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,870
ironic adaptive learning yes how do you

00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,800
think that AI will have impact on

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,550
education and other industries say over

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,680
the next five to ten years totally

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,680
change probably yeah we would like to

00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,729
say there are four key characteristics

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,960
of AI and I think I remember the first

00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:38,300
one is AI nose kind of everything more

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,250
than human beings right we noticed some

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,770
changes from like other people around

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:47,479
the world but AI probably knows much

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,729
more than us yes right and the second

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,949
one is like when we go through the

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:54,169
customs now it's been changed that

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,300
there's a facial recognition system to

00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,990
capture our face right it used to be

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,289
human right now is a eyes doing this and

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,720
we'll save our cost and save our time

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,449
save Labor's and most important thing is

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,150
is more accurate right right we cannot

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:14,479
recognize I think the previous rate was

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:19,729
95 percent accuracy by humans and now is

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,310
about 98 percent accuracy by AI and also

00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:25,370
computing power as human beings we

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,340
cannot calculate and compute things so

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,289
fast right and AI is probably 100,000

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,529
times faster than us very clear

00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:36,049
limitations and there's a last one

00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:39,349
a little bit challenging and some people

00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:42,229
afraid of it is self involving like

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:46,369
alpha go right and Africa zero it can

00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:48,889
learn from itself okay yeah that's our

00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:51,769
system is doing the same thing that at

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,199
the beginning we teach AI we teach the a

00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:56,749
a platform to learn from the teachers

00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,979
who learn from the students and later on

00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:03,619
our AI system learns from itself so

00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:06,499
that's kind of self evolving and my son

00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:09,729
asked me your question beginning of this

00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:12,459
month mom do you think AI has feelings

00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,899
that's a very scary question right

00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:19,579
self-evolving is probably kind of

00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:22,309
feelings instincts similar to human so

00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,919
that's a scary but I wouldn't think so

00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:27,499
yeah I still think that human beings

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,839
were kind of a monster and control AI

00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:32,059
but yeah I will definitely change a lot

00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,979
of things in our life I have to work

00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:35,479
together with AI and be friends and be

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:38,929
families definitely it's that

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:41,419
collaboration yes what is it about

00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:44,119
education that's that's very special in

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:47,209
regards to AI know that your founder had

00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:50,569
been working in education before so how

00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:53,029
does this really fit into AI because in

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,489
traditional education all the students

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:57,860
in the same classroom right they learn

00:07:55,489 --> 00:08:00,199
at the same speed at same time the same

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,149
contents but all the students are

00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,249
different you have me different you are

00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:08,929
good students oh maybe we are both very

00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:10,669
like good student but we are our

00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:12,489
strengths are different right

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,439
so the students need to learn

00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:17,749
personalized ly individualized and

00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,999
customized for me and customized for you

00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:22,249
maybe your strengths is a mess and my

00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,219
strengths is English so we should learn

00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:26,960
differently so traditional education

00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:29,660
cannot do in that way

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,360
I can help because AI has so many

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,120
characteristics right so many features

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,870
and yeah I can do human beings cannot do

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,659
and teachers get overwhelmed with that

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,729
and I can help teachers to reduce the

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:46,250
time of working and working more

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,529
passionately mr. students not like

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,320
teaching all the components and to the

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:54,020
students and get frustrated and angry

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,110
stressful right and they will be smiling

00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:00,500
all the time happy encouraging students

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,410
so AI can do in that way to do like

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:08,300
individualized education so adaptive

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:10,459
learning is one of the main like how to

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,830
say it's one of the main technology to

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,350
do personalized learning like robots

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,930
interaction is another way but it's not

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:21,040
really personalized learning right it's

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,620
like if you're more interesting and

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,350
facing technology it's different way of

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,050
Education but the main area that what we

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,600
focus your education is personalized

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:36,470
evolution adaptive we think that this is

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,500
the main base that education can be

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,180
changed and I can imagine from what

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,490
you've described about the founding

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,810
staff many of these people are experts

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,730
in education

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,260
they've been professors they've been

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,790
teachers for a long time so they're

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,770
coming at it probably from perspective

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,520
empathizing they've been in this role

00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:58,940
for so long exactly yes well what's it

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,330
like to build AI plus education as a

00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,620
company in China what what kind of

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,830
challenges and opportunities right yeah

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,410
well it was huge challenge like four and

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,100
a half years ago when we started doing

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:16,040
this AI plus education company everyone

00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,000
was asking what is AI and we couldn't

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,490
get funding at a time if we said it AI

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,070
so other investors told us mmm you

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,170
better change it to internet-based

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,420
education ya know if they change and

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,910
then we've got funds okay yeah

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,800
because no one knew what is a I know hey

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,070
I was not that popular at a time but you

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,980
have that vision yes we did and about

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:42,680
three years later and there were many

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,900
companies I started doing a education

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,620
but that was already three years later

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:51,080
than a solo yeah and now there are about

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,440
60 companies in China saying that they

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,060
are AI adaptive learning companies yes

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,430
some of them they do have very good

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,020
technology and some of them I can't

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,190
really say no but you know they're

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:07,280
trying to use this concept yeah yeah the

00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:11,060
bird in tomorrow yes but which means

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,630
this industry is going to be huge it's

00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,210
developing really rapidly because many

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,710
competitors many companies are into this

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:21,260
industrial we're gonna you know work

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,470
together to expand this whole industry

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:27,500
so it's getting better now yeah but I

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,260
still not as good as us because as far

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,150
as we know that they're about 20 percent

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,090
of the students have started using

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:40,490
personalized learning system either like

00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:42,200
a Khan Academy oh yes especially great

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,600
school yeah but you China I think that's

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,180
an two or three percent intrusive yeah

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,090
so people don't really know what is in

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,040
education yet so that's why we started

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,740
doing one thing for the whole industry

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,400
which is called we started organizing a

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,860
conference called a IAE D which is AI

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,110
adaptive education international

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:06,200
conferences the reason we want to do

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,730
that is to let Chinese audience to let

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,190
Chinese market to know what is a

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,009
education so we brought many or

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:16,889
a guy companies and professor scientist

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:19,529
in AI and education area to come to

00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,620
China and give talk and tell people what

00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:27,000
it's like in UK the u.s. so that's one

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,730
thing we do yeah fantastic how effective

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,470
is this then I mean talking about the

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,709
product when you're really when you're

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:36,990
working with students how effective is

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:39,329
shkreli is learning product that's the

00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,459
part I really want to talk about every

00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,569
time when I talk about other either I'm

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,939
really excited

00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:49,800
Oh sometimes we you know get really

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:52,350
emotions touched the figure is like 70

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,389
to 80% of the students who have used our

00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,579
system for more than three months they

00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:59,850
have different levels of improvements

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:02,790
yeah like some of them they have scars

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,040
in Christ some of them they didn't like

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:08,069
to study before and they started to be

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,949
interested engaged yeah in the study and

00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:13,980
I because there was so many thank-you

00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:16,740
letters from their parents and was very

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,259
you know emotional it's really good to

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:22,560
the heart yes yes I remember recently I

00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:26,160
read a story a dead sending a letter to

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,860
us well but that evolves with his wife

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,519
the mother and the girl the daughter was

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:35,610
kind of didn't want to talk to anyone at

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,459
all and kind of hate her dad and even

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,189
didn't want to talk to teachers and they

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,560
couldn't communicate and the girl got

00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:46,680
really poor scars all the time and the

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,259
dad didn't give up and he found our

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,319
learning centers and wanted to try and a

00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:55,230
girl started learning you know centers

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:58,050
and get about I think 30 to 30 points

00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,389
for the score increased and the girls

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,160
started talking to the teachers the

00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,009
human teachers you know in the

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,120
learning centers and then later she

00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:13,709
started talking to her dad Wow so many

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,930
times a story what's fantastic though is

00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:19,370
it's about how AI have this technology

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:22,290
also helps us as humans with each other

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:24,420
so we are you know very happy to see all

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:27,420
the outcomes and see the results from

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,970
the students and that's I think the

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,250
happiest time we ever we ever had and

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,319
when we receive any thank-you letter we

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,980
know this examples in this case from the

00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:42,209
family just so excited yeah fantastic

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,680
well I'm delighted to hear about what

you're doing and how well this is

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,509
working I hope that this works through

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,060
seeds to roll out in a much bigger way

00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:53,449
and thank you very much thank you so
