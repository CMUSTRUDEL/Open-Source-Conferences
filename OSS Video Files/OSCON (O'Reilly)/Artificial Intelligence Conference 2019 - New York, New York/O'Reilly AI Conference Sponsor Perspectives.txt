	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
you

00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:12,119
[Music]

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:14,859
I came to learn about it

00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,680
hey I use the future right so everything

00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:19,779
is attractive and every booth that you

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,130
go to there's something to learn usually

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:22,900
you spend an hour talking about like

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,250
what is AI what is mana and I haven't

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,660
had that question once it's more it's

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,470
gonna details what is knowledge mining

00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,510
what are you doing with Bob services and

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,890
what are you doing with machine learning

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,180
and what you know what do you offer and

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,980
what are other customers doing we're

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,720
having much deeper conversations with

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,090
customers for example how do I combine

00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,370
natural language with text analytics

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,800
with computer vision to solve a problem

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,600
and to me that's a really helpful sign

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,910
because it shows that the understanding

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,220
of this technology is growing one of the

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,920
best things about this conference is you

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,080
get one-to-one access with so many

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,210
practitioners people who are in the

00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,750
weeds for doing the actual ground work

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,339
it's so refreshing to hear that they can

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:11,700
read their challenges are one of the

00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:13,770
emerging trends get a more general sense

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,659
since about like what people are coming

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,820
for and I feel like everyone seems

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,320
pretty enthused about what they're

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,420
getting away from the conference the

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,010
keynote sessions were great and there

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,240
have been audiences here right through

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,920
the day I mean I've been studying

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,479
talking to a lot of people I've met

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,330
people from many different industries

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,520
ranging from government to

00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,530
pharmaceutical and finance and they all

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,760
they all have different types of data

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,760
but they all have the same

00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,030
we're only at the forefront right now

00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,340
it's overwhelming so much you're

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,470
learning so exciting I guess see this

00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,619
one I'm pure the next conference the

00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:52,720
next next iteration of a bigger

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,440
