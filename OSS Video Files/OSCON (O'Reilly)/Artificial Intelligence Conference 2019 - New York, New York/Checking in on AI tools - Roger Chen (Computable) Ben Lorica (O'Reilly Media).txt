	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
so we wanted to take a few minutes to go

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,379
over the results of a recent survey as

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,730
well let's talk about some of the things

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:15,089
we're seeing in the AI space so first

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,460
off as many of you know last year we

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,930
gave talks where we excited the number

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,330
of papers being published in machine

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,039
learning so for example there's a

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,710
website called archive and there's about

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,160
a hundred papers uploaded there every

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,399
day but all of that research is also

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,579
being translated into patent filings so

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,649
I was fortunate enough to be part of a

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,620
recent study from the World Intellectual

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,870
Patent Office and as you can see the

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,410
number of patent filings is also growing

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,210
fast and this basically reinforces the

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,890
notion that we are entering the

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,079
implementation phase for AI so notably

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,410
computer vision is mentioned in about

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,539
half of all AI related patents and the

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,460
number of patent filings in computer

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:09,990
vision is growing fast 24 percent since

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:11,970
2011 so in this conference we have many

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,729
many sessions on computer vision over

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,350
the next few days now it's been a

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,939
extremely productive year for

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,860
researchers and natural language in

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,420
particular it feels like every few

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,280
months there are new deep learning

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,369
models are establishing records and many

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,710
different natural language tasks and

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,900
benchmarks and much of this research was

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,280
done in the open fortunately accompanied

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,420
by open source code and pre-trained

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,820
models which is always great for the

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,650
communities we already are already

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,659
seeing companies were going to tune

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,700
these models for the specific domains

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,100
and applications there are many sessions

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,450
on text speech and natural language at

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,670
this conference including a talk

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,820
tomorrow by shaming way one of the

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,740
creators of Bert now we continue to see

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,530
improvements and tools for deep learning

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,060
as well to our survey tional that

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,829
tentacle implies words remain in most

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,930
popular libraries but we're also seeing

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,240
tools from companies like weights and

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,009
biases and determined AI designed for

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,930
companies with growing teams of deep

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,119
learning engineers and data scientists

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,890
these tools help optimize compute

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,900
resources automate various stages of

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,560
model building and help users

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,620
tract and manage their experiments so in

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,769
our recent survey which drew over 1300

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,000
respondents we found about a fifth of

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,620
the people signaled that they're

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,379
beginning to use reinforcement learning

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,560
so one of the reasons is that we have

00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,269
many more tools so open source

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,450
proprietary and cloud services for doing

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:38,730
RL so over the next few days we're gonna

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,030
have many many interesting sessions on

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,670
RL including a talk by Danny Lang of

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,819
unity who will describe their platform

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,709
for conducting RL research as well as

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,540
sanjay krishnan of the university of

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,019
chicago who will share his work on the

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,290
application of RL in diverse areas

00:02:54,019 --> 00:03:00,840
including robotics and data management

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,959
so let's zoom in and one of the tools

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,599
that is gaining traction so we've been

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,280
offering a tutorial on distributed

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,129
computing framework which is open source

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,500
called ray so ray supports both

00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,870
stateless and stateful competent

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,169
computations and fine gained

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,609
fine-grained control over scheduling

00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:23,940
this means that you can implement many

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,750
many services so you can implement hyper

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,260
parameter tuning streaming in

00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,120
reinforcement learning

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,299
so in particular the most popular

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,540
library for Ray is our a Lib and our a

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:39,359
Lib provides a unified API for different

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,760
types of RL training this means that

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,569
both users and researchers are beginning

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,430
to benefit from using RL Lib last year

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,199
we began tracking many starts building

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,260
specialized hardware for deep learning

00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,500
AI both for training and inference and

00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,569
both of these happen in the edge but

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,400
also within data centers now towards the

00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,629
latter part of this year we expect some

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,280
of these companies to begin releasing

00:04:00,629 --> 00:04:04,560
hardware that's going to greatly

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,470
accelerate a training inference while

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,079
being much more energy efficient in our

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,459
recent survey we found that over 60% of

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,139
companies are planning to invest at

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,909
least some of their IT budget into AI

00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,530
but the level of investment really

00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:18,299
depended on how much experience a

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,190
company fill I already had with AI

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,409
technologies and as you can see from

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:24,479
this slide those are mature practice

00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:26,220
practices plan to invest a sizable

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,110
portion of their IT budget into AI

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,910
and there's a strong likelihood as a

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,100
result that there may be a widening gap

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,210
between leaders and laggards in this

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,720
regard so let's take a deep dive in

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,120
what's holding back adoption so

00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,280
according to our survey the answer

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,050
depends on the level of maturity so

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,030
those who are just getting started

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,540
still struggle with identifying use

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:54,210
cases for AI technologies or in or even

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:58,620
convincing their peers within the

00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,300
company that AI will be useful on the

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,010
other hand those with mature practice

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,790
struggle with things like lack of data

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:10,110
and lack of skilled people so let's look

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:12,180
at the skill scrap more closely skills

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,770
requirements really depend again as Ben

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,290
mentioned on the level maturity and

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,670
companies are more mature AI practices

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,980
tend to have less trouble finding use

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:22,380
cases and they also have less need for

00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,240
data scientists however the need for

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,770
data infrastructure engineers cut across

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
numerous companies right and it's

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,850
important to remind ourselves that much

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,800
of AI today requires large amounts of

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,200
training data but in order to process

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,320
that you need large amounts of computer

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,169
resources to Train very large models as

00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,669
the use of AI technology is grows within

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,080
companies we're going to see better

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,090
tools for machine learning development

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,130
tools that can automate many stages of a

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,020
machine learning pipeline at this

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,610
conference we have many talks on your

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,950
architecture speech for including one

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,780
from Amita Walker of Carnegie Mellon and

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,100
determined AI we've also got several

00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,710
companies - about Thomas and my

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,480
offerings including data a ku Microsoft

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,330
a robot who are all going to be

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,970
exhibiting at the expo expo hall so

00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,090
companies are also realizing that ml and

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:12,150
AI requires more than just optimizing

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,710
business and statistical metrics so we

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,690
have many speakers over the next few

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,750
days who will explain various techniques

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,310
that are being used to develop

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,650
responsible AI so there are many

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,240
important considerations so for example

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,070
in our survey we found that many

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,700
companies are already starting to check

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,790
for fairness and bias there are also a

00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,140
growing number of researchers and

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,479
companies looking into machine learning

00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,270
models that are able to protect privacy

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,969
so in this conference we have several

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,369
sessions

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:45,519
these topics including talks by Yishai

00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:46,989
Carmel and Martin doll who who will be

00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,569
giving talks on privacy preserving

00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:52,169
machine learning tools specifically

00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:55,269
tools that applied to deep learning and

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:58,029
topped by Alina Mathieu kina and Seaway

00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:59,979
Lu who will be giving talks between the

00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:03,699
interplay of machine learning and

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,649
digital forensics as that gets deployed

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:08,199
in mission critical situations like

00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,789
autonomous vehicles or health medical

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,499
applications this community needs to

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:13,419
develop tools and best practices to

00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:15,699
ensure safety we have leading

00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:17,199
researchers like Joanna Bryson of the

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,239
University of Bath and Alexander

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,699
Marjorie of MIT here at the conference

00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,199
to talk about that topic

00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,149
now many AI systems will continue to

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,159
interact with or even depend on humans

00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,289
and that's why design and transparents

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,369
are also going to be important

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:32,679
considerations for those who build AI

00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:34,389
applications these are topics where we

00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:36,429
have many sessions over the next two

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,309
days including talks by furrow pour

00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:43,719
sabzi of Microsoft Research near my C

00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:45,579
and Andrews Zaldivar of Google one last

00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,469
word about data security in the age of

00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,119
AI there are many situations where data

00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:51,459
integrity will be as critical as did a

00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:53,499
confidentiality now remember that many

00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,599
add systems are highly depend on data

00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:57,309
used for training and so building data

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,110
infrastructure that can keep track of

00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,879
data governments and lineage will be

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,559
difficult but important not only for

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,360
security and quality assurance audits

00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,749
but also for compliance with existing

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,309
and future regulations the good news is

00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:12,219
that companies are beginning to build

00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:14,259
these foundational tools for data

00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:17,279
infrastructure that will be critical to
