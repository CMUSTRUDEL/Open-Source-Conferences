funny everyone i'm jolene from squirrel

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,790
AI learning a squirrel learning is a

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,759
company provides personalized learning

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,230
platform with contents to help students

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,660
learning more efficiently and

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:21,060
effectively and our company founded in

00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:24,090
2014 and we have over 1,800 learning

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,939
centers in over 300 cities in China and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,789
we have reached 150 million u.s. dollars

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,070
so far so we have two business model and

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,870
one is the online model and another one

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,500
is the physical learning location

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,480
learning center and the students learn

00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,120
70% of the time from the AI system which

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,579
is the AI teacher and another 30% of

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,879
time they learn from the human coach and

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,210
we did four competitions which is human

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,879
versus AI competition in over the first

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,469
the last one half years and all the

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,559
results showed that the students learn

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,949
from the AI tutor and they get better

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,290
scores at the end and also they have

00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:07,409
learned more amount of the knowledge

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,869
points at the same time compared to the

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,170
human teachers and this is the structure

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,630
of our system so for the first layer we

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,580
have the learning map content map and

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,890
the goals and for the second we have the

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,750
real-time prediction and real-time and

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,900
recommendation and the third layer is

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:28,049
the real-time invent collectors such as

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,180
niba and in this learning map for

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,310
student it has different kind of colors

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,180
for at the mastery of the look but for

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,310
the CIM learning points so the red color

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,340
means the students have not mastered

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,720
this knowledge point and for the red for

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,939
the green ones means they have already

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,470
mastered and four different other colors

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,860
means different percentage of the

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,380
mastery and we had the first eye in the

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,750
world the technique which is called NKC

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,409
nano scale breakdown of the knowledge

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,799
components so the regular amount of the

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,869
subject of the components should be 300

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,090
about and we do the breakdown to the

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:11,640
30,000 knowledge funds which means the

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,990
students can learn more precisely they

00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,720
only need to learn the nan

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,650
scale level of the knowledge funds that

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,350
they have not mastered so this is one

00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,230
example so we have nine layers of the

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,390
knowledge points breakdown and we also

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,790
believe that students should not only

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,470
learn the knowledge funds but also the

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,930
mode of thinking capacity and

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,380
methodology that's why we invented this

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,300
MCM study system and we also do the

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,670
breakdown for model thinking capacity

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,890
and methodology such as we do model

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,350
thinking breakdown in physics and we do

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,720
our skills breakdown in math subject and

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,210
we do the methodology breakdown in

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,430
Chinese subject and this is a Content

00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,890
map instead of our content map we have

00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,560
different time of videos such as lecture

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,500
notes teacher recorded video and

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,600
animation and we use information theory

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,200
based in theory knowledge space theory

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,660
to diagnose students learning learning

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,940
state and knowledge map knowledge gap

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,130
here's one example three students have

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,890
the same percentage of the mastery but

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,630
they have different weaknesses this is

00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,520
the first student the red ones means

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,620
they have not mastered the second

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,110
students we can see from the assessment

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,510
they have different weaknesses and the

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,420
third students have another knowledge

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,490
graph of weaknesses and we do have the

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,450
goals and dynamic goals in our system

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,610
and we have one project with Stanford

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,280
Research Institute which is the human

00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,320
machine interface and we have another

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,960
moebus system which is called matomoto

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,450
integrated behavior analysis which is

00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,970
the real-time data collection from the

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,510
students like I casing and blood

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,150
pressure and some other data try to

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,970
evaluate how the students concentration

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,950
is and we believe that no students

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,140
should be sitting in the same classroom

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,780
because they are all different for the

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,150
same knowledge point all the students

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,940
spend different time on the same one and

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,190
for one students he or she spends

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,959
different time for different knowledge

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:21,989
point and we believe a I will definitely

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,300
upgrade the whole education and help the

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,760
students to reduce the time of the study

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,910
by 80% and the increased

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,460
study results to get higher scars and

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,130
learn more knowledge points and the very

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,810
good result is that 70 to 80 percent of

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,700
the students who have learned from our

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,810
system over three months they have

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,330
different levels of the improvements and

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:48,030
last year in depth in November very good

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,610
news is the Dean of computer science

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,590
department professor Tom Mitchell has

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,260
joined our company as the chief AI

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,360
officer and also we have John labs with

00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,700
Stanford Research Institute and Carnegie

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,340
Mellon University and last year we

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,980
started donating 1 million static

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,350
accounts to enter privileged families in

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,480
China and we are going to donate other

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,250
free accounts to the world

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:15,150
once our system has the English

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,850
curriculum and English system so we

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:20,460
believe that our school a I super AI

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,800
teacher should be a combination of Toph

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,560
in chief Zuccotti and Einstein thank you

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,779
very much

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,779
[Applause]

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,010
