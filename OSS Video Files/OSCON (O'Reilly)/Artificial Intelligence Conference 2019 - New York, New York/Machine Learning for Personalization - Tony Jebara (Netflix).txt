For many years, the main goal of the Netflix recommendation system has been to get the right titles in front of each member at the right time. Tony Jebara details the approaches Netflix uses to recommend titles to users and discusses how the company is working on integrating causality and fairness into many of its machine learning and personalization systems.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,560
we like to think at Netflix of our

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,309
service has really not a single service

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,370
or a single product but 140 or so

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,190
million products because each user each

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,890
profile gets their own customized

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,570
personalized experience and so if you

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,480
open up your page what you're seeing is

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,880
a experience that's been designed for

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,439
you from kind of top to bottom and this

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,080
is the unique version of the Netflix

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,880
product for you and the way it becomes

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,529
unique is because we use machine

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,570
learning to figure out how to

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,399
personalize the ranking of our entire

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,770
catalog so all the movies and TV shows

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,780
which ones are the top ones for you

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,370
what's your number one that's sure

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,500
what's your number two one and so forth

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,270
then the actual layout of the page and

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,780
the way we organize those movies and TV

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,460
shows is also powered by machine

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,680
learning in a personalized way for you

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,120
what we promote to you as a newly

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,789
launching title upstairs in the

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,399
billboard is also another aspect that's

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,680
personalized we choose the most likely

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,030
title that you'll most likely watch and

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,979
a whole bunch of other thing from

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,229
messaging to marketing and so forth and

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,030
search but today I'll be focusing on how

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,680
we personalize the imagery and because

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,860
that really communicates a lot to the

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,580
user of the why behind our

00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,930
recommendation engine there's a big

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,939
engine here that's explained that's

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,420
showing you things to personalize

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,770
experience for you but why show me this

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,869
and so if you remove the image aspect

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,549
from our recommendation engine you

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,610
basically see something that looks like

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,320
this this is the decisions of the

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,299
recommendation engine of what this user

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,520
will be interested in watching that so

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,750
stranger things is one of the titles you

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,090
should look at and here's a few other

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,490
movies and TV shows but that's a very

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,070
bland page and it doesn't tell me why is

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,310
stranger things being recommended to me

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,189
or promoted to me and so one key way we

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,820
can explain why is to pick the image and

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,450
think of this as your gateway into this

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,909
recommended choice for you and so here

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,740
are nine different box arts or images

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,299
and what we can do is use machine

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,299
learning to personalize how we present

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,190
stranger thanks to you perhaps we

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,080
realize that you're into let's say

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,209
teenage or younger shows so it's great

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,319
for us to show you this image of two

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,810
teenagers

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,519
as the entry point into the show if you

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,290
know nothing about it or if you like to

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,689
watch scary horror movies maybe we

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,849
should show the image of this kind of

00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:26,730
slightly creepy looking

00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,989
bleeding nose scene and that may

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,340
intrigue you and say oh there's

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,709
something in there for me as well

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,629
or you might like younger actors and

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,489
think of kids and you may find the

00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,500
appealing picture in the middle with the

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,569
kind of youngest actors in the show

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,680
rather than the teenagers so how do we

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,909
do this how do we explain to you that

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,090
this is something you're interested in

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:47,280
because it contains this gateway theme

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,590
that we think is relevant to you from

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,519
your personal history and how you've

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,519
consumed things in the past

00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,569
