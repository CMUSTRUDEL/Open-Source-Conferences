hi I'm parka Nathan with the Riley media

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,130
and we're here at the O'Reilly

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,799
artificial intelligence conference in

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,679
New York City and today it's pleasure to

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,990
be joined by Curt you know who's VP of

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,910
Sales Engineering at Tucker yeah yes

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,920
this mission this be sitting with you

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,670
great photography I really enjoyed your

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,650
keynote this morning

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,660
oh thanks fantastic it's such an

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,090
important topic I'm just really happy to

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,019
be able to lend my voice to it it's it's

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,699
something that we should all be thinking

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,260
about certainly I especially like

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,449
there's a lot of great examples and was

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,149
like fast cuts this this this is what it

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,410
is important yeah I we feel that it's

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,260
really something that should be top of

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,750
mind you know even if you know the

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,280
objective of business is not necessarily

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,200
to make a positive impact on the world

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,399
right um you know we're businesses

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,230
looking to make money and that's that's

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,450
fine sure but I think that we do have a

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,489
responsibility to at least avoid harm

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,690
where we can and I think that's

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,059
something that we we should be conscious

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,710
of especially in this kind of work with

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,300
AI where there is so much potential for

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,699
impact well that's the thing right it's

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,920
this it's this huge lever on human

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,080
potential and like any technology right

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,479
that's that's the case so it means that

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,430
you know you can either be having great

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,439
positive impact that's where we start

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,850
talking about value in our ally or of

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,549
course positive societal benefits as

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,250
well which which are not negligible or

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,170
you can run the risk of having you know

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,729
potentially severe negative impact as

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,560
well um I saw one of the other speakers

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,049
this morning mentioning you know that

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,799
it's like a like a very sharp knife

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:29,220
there you know it's something that you

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,810
can use to prepare a wonderful dinner or

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,360
of course it could be a terrible weapon

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,680
if it's in the wrong hands or if you're

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,750
not careful with it and that's the thing

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,970
um it's not necessarily about

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,790
intentionally trying to cause harm but

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,920
it's through I guess neglect is maybe

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,140
even you know negligence or carelessness

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,820
is maybe even too strong it's often just

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,220
that thinking about it unintended

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,160
exactly yeah

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,360
wonderful well about our I why is

00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,690
calculating ROI for data a I projects

00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,040
why is that difficult and really what's

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,980
the best place to start on that sure

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,210
well so why is calculating ROI a

00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,440
difficult and this is something that

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,990
we've seen with a lot of different

00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,280
customers right um on the one hand of

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,590
course we're looking to sell our

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,540
software we're hoping to explain that it

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,100
will have a positive our life when

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,570
customers are using our software they're

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,950
often looking to explain the benefit of

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,020
not just our software but the you know

00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,910
the initiative around ml or AI more

00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,890
broadly but the challenge is that you

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,490
know data and the application of it

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,260
through AI ml is so broad it's so

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,540
pervasive but it's really difficult to

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,550
separate out you know exactly what is

00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,350
the specific benefit of this one

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,730
technology versus another you know we

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,200
don't have a lot of controlled

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,640
experiments you know within the context

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,620
of your model development you might be

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,360
doing some a be testing a so on but that

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,380
doesn't really tell the whole story it's

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,030
almost like trying to calculate the

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,950
benefit of well what's now becoming

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,980
pervasive technology electricity things

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,900
like that it's just so so embedded in

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,540
every single process it's difficult to

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,730
pull that away in so I think that's a

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,280
that's an a common challenge that we're

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,160
looking to to put one single number and

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,380
you know the dollar value of AI and I

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,760
don't think that's the right approach if

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,680
companies are looking to get started on

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,050
it you know generally what we what we do

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,820
recommend is that they you know that

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,890
they do try to start small not

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,200
quantified the entire impact but let's

00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,670
start by quantifying a few impacts and

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,459
those can be all across the number of

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,260
different metrics be at you time saved

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:26,060
improvements to various processes you

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,239
know that that's much more attainable

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,890
much more attractable as a problem than

00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,450
saying what is the value of this overall

00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,130
to our entire organization

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,900
most people are convinced that there is

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,850
value the question is really how much

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,100
and I don't know that we'll ever get to

00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,570
to to that full accounting of exactly

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,400
what is this the value of this because

00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,019
again you know like the lights in this

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,780
room how do we quantify the benefit of

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,910
that um but at least by starting a

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,250
little by little we can we can help one

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,870
another understand why we're doing this

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,790
what's worth spending on and

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,560
that investment should go it's also this

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,920
relatively earlier it seems relatively

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,450
early in the game I mean perhaps years

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,470
from now we'll have a much deeper bench

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,269
of case studies I can help quantify

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,480
interesting observation from from one of

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,650
our own in this case a prospect you know

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,360
company that who we were speaking with

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,430
was if we're wondering you know at what

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,820
point does data you know go on the books

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:21,169
as an asset in following GAAP rules you

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,699
know this is what your data is valued at

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,900
and here's how we assess this and you

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,449
know right or wrong

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,639
there could be an agreed upon framework

00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,960
for comparing these assets and that's of

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,460
course again what we see with various

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,620
accounting principles right right it's

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,539
not the single truth but it is

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,430
comparable across companies and perhaps

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,789
that could be an interesting Avenue it

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,500
for the future as well very good so what

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,539
are some of the most important factors

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,090
to consider in this kind of RI

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:49,460
calculation so for instance are there

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,470
hidden costs or opportunities that

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,810
organizations forget to include when

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,580
they're trying to assess this yeah I

00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,260
think I think so right because once

00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,660
again you know you're discussing at the

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,280
beginning there are risks to to doing

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,250
this right so reputational risks and so

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,380
on also compliance run GDP are in Europe

00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,930
obviously is top of mind for for many of

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,669
us you know if you read the the opinions

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,530
section in you know the major newspapers

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,639
in the United States you do see some

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,710
calls for something similar in the

00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,450
United States California it's already

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,700
gone through legislature exactly coming

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,760
in next year so you know at what point

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,010
does that does that become nationwide or

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,120
you know often like I guess car

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,349
emissions are another example right

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,330
California leads on that and the

00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,590
industry has tomorrow right are we going

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,940
to see something similar like that so

00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,250
these compliance questions become

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,690
increasingly important and so when you

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,449
are doing this accounting or attempting

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,430
to you don't want to play down the the

00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:43,010
potential risks and downsides and the

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:44,030
costs associated with it as well and

00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,039
that's one of the one of our

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,289
recommendations as well typically is we

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,400
don't encourage people to overestimate

00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,110
because once again we don't want to end

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,000
up in a situation of inflated

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:57,800
expectations

00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,470
than in the email field for their

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,880
cousins it's now maybe right now there

00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,200
actually is you know we are really

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,720
seeing some some really interesting

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,610
applications now so we know is different

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,820
but we would we don't want to overdo it

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:14,390
as as well so so in terms of you know

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:17,090
some of the opportunities for for doing

00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,310
this I think a lot of the opportunity is

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,350
really internal to the to the companies

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:24,560
that are that are doing this it's to be

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,540
able to both explain up and sideways and

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
bounding in all directions within the

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:30,410
organization why we're doing this

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,880
because of course up it might be

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,740
interested in you know is are we

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,990
actually getting money back on our

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,940
investment but sideways and down

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,950
throughout the organization it helps to

00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,050
bring people on board to understand why

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,970
you know this technology is coming in

00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,140
now it's meant to be disruptive which

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,910
means that we need to get people on

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,410
board to understand why we're

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,790
necessarily changing things even when it

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,320
does mean that it may mean that

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,820
hopefully their job is not going away

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,350
but it may be changing or being

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:58,700
augmented or assisted in different ways

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,500
as well I've heard mention of how email

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,090
models to some extent are kind of a

00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,620
proxy about before the date of it's

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,450
behind them so sort of a generalization

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,919
of data but in the same way they're also

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,770
somewhat of a proxy for the

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,320
organizational languages and so as you

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,300
can build more and more models that

00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,979
you're using your business process then

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,870
you've got this kind of lens on your own

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,150
internal collective knowledge that's

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,770
right and that's one of the beautiful

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,050
potentials of these applications as well

00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,320
is you know can we take the best of the

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,270
company and codify it in a way that

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,000
could then be applied automatically to

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,010
into new situations and perhaps even it

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,580
with with even better performance and

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,410
then what you know

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,720
the human part of the organization would

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,240
be able to to achieve now that's a great

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,280
potential and but at the same time right

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,110
we need to make sure that the

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,150
individuals who are going to be impacted

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,970
by that that there is due consideration

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,200
given to to them as well but once again

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,540
with these technologies which are

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,120
generally creating value it's going to

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,680
change jobs some jobs may indeed go away

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,500
we should not you know say that that

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,970
will never happen but what we should

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,000
work to ensure is that as with previous

00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,560
technological to transitions that there

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,450
are new opportunities being created as a

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,210
result for everybody to participate in

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,870
the the value that's being created well

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,900
well

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,790
dig into that a bit more besides RI

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,430
besides showing that what can

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,920
organizations do to demonstrate the

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,720
value of their initiatives in in AI

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,160
well so I think they can break this out

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,570
you know along a number of different

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,540
metrics you know there's the the pure

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,800
business value are around you know what

00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,570
is it you know how have we improved

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,070
whatever top line bottom line right

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,210
wherever that's going to hit men you

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,410
know we can list through the you know

00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,910
the different ways you can generate more

00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,020
revenue or save costs or both at the

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,640
same time through the different

00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,130
application so those are goals they're

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,490
usually associated right whereas I think

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,720
the the other value right you know can

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,190
sometimes be you know maybe one step

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,750
removed still on the business side but

00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,780
you know about positioning and

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:56,190
sustainability of the of the company and

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,840
I mean sustainability in the broad sense

00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,670
not and not just in the you know the

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,590
environment to citrus another topic also

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,540
important like competitive this team

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,860
exactly right I know how are we going to

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:10,140
continue as a has a going affair in this

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,730
ever-changing world and I think that

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,770
that's one of the the key values where

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,650
the investment early on can pay

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,140
dividends for years and decades to come

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,960
because certainly the you know the world

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,790
around us is is not slowing down in that

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,050
competitive landscape is only getting

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,790
hotter and hotter every day

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,050
been lorica was talking this morning

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,750
about some of the surveys we've done

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,220
yeah and the the most important takeaway

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,870
that we've had from those is how much

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,550
that gap is widening yeah between the

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,590
companies that are investing in AI

00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,580
initiatives and the ones who just aren't

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,080
even getting started yet

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,310
exactly and it seems like you know we

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,630
used to talk about every year that you

00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,040
delay the the investment in the

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,680
initiatives now it feels like every

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,899
quarter

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,339
well I and some of the transformation

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,619
work that you must do even as table

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,329
stakes can take years as a larger

00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:54,910
transition before you can get to the

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,490
point of changing things no in the index

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,050
you know we ante that goober software

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,119
vendor right now we have our technology

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,240
but a lot of the questions that we get

00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:05,559
in the context of these of these these

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,420
broader discussions about using our

00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,860
technology a really organizational

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,869
question a transformation questions

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,129
about who should be doing what how

00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:13,720
should the organization be structured

00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,959
what should the you know the approval

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,119
process be for for example you know

00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,470
obtaining new data to train a model on

00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,779
which is then deployed into production

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,639
under which process well that there's no

00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:26,470
mess there's not necessarily a standard

00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,879
response to that we're doing our best to

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,230
you know to help with that we've been

00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,410
thinking about the problem for for some

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,279
time but I think this is some area where

00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,869
we're going to see a lot of progress

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,519
both on the technology but I'm the

00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:37,929
organizational side as well well that's

00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,839
a great proof point though is as a

00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,550
vendor coming in if you can solve the

00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:44,619
problems from the software side and

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,839
start to bring before the organizational

00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:48,579
challenges that's an excellent proof

00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:50,769
point that they value the software again

00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:53,259
that's really what you know kind of the

00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:55,689
the good vision of the founders was that

00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,009
essentially the previous or the prior

00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,929
traditional ways of working

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:00,759
we're generally a single tool set was

00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:03,670
given to a single population

00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:04,990
you know first in certain structured

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,249
contexts that works very well you have

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,449
the best debride software for this

00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,209
population at best improve software

00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:12,610
further for that population but really

00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:14,410
and especially in the ml and AI context

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,300
that really results in some big

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,069
challenges when you're trying to have

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,889
this very fast-moving iterative

00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:22,600
development cycle that necessarily or at

00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:24,610
least hopefully is involving people from

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,569
across the organization which is really

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,100
the core vision that went into building

00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:28,509
this partner this product that we have

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,009
now today which really does bring all

00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,309
those people together throughout the

00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:34,689
entire life cycle of a project fantastic

00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:38,100
what are some of the best practices then

00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:40,600
when you're creating an ROI model on

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,069
using these tools yes what what what's

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,610
the practice saw well I mentioned the

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,799
first one that I'll be mentioning

00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:48,050
because it's really important don't over

00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:50,059
or don't inflate the numbers right good

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,589
we've all done it personal budgets you

00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,189
know a couple of cells in Excel and hey

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,050
look I'm a millionaire right it's easy

00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:59,290
don't do that but then you know I think

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,610
that you you need to spend a lot of time

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,629
ground-truthing and the ROI model as

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,059
well the same whether you had a

00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,739
predictive model fresher or an

00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,149
unsupervised learning about right does

00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:10,279
this actually make sense

00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,629
and taking that out to you know the

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:13,100
people within the organization on the

00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,869
business side we even on the finance

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,009
side you know to ask them you know this

00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:19,279
is what we're the way that we're

00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:21,139
accounting for the the model it's or the

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,389
value of these initiatives does that

00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,879
make sense to you and then you know the

00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:28,100
third recommendation would be to you

00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:29,959
know to to use tools to use platforms

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,819
and they do allow you to to centralize

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,379
some of this work because again a lot of

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,759
the challenges for in this field today

00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:36,980
is that a lot of the effort is dispersed

00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,379
within the organization and so if there

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,269
is an initiative to bring that together

00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:43,819
you know that that also pays dividends

00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,649
on the accounting side as well where now

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:47,239
we have a full understanding of all the

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,739
activity all the initiatives the status

00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:50,749
of all the projects how many models are

00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:54,589
running in production how many have been

00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:58,160
read a today's that could be at least

00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,959
useful proxy metrics for value at least

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,540
now in the organizations that have

00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:03,889
centralized on a common platform in full

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,170
disclosure that's the sort of product

00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:07,490
form that we provide right but it does a

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,509
you know in addition to the governance

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,160
benefits and so on there is this

00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:11,540
accounting benefit and that's also

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,100
something that we've seen from our from

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,869
our customers and actually something

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,999
that we're developing as well the sort

00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:18,559
of a value scorecard to assist our

00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:20,029
customers in in assessing what is the

00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:21,170
value that they're getting specifically

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,879
out of the use of our platform and

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,490
obviously that's for for selfish

00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,740
purposes but that's something that that

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,660
we have found has been very appreciated

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,749
because at least that's one part of this

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,490
this bigger equation excellent well the

00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,699
ground truth it brings to mind is a lot

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,189
of what we do

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:39,809
you know maybe testing multi events or

00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:41,730
whatever it was just proving out models

00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:42,869
this we're really kind of drinking the

00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,540
kool-aid here of course we should right

00:13:42,869 --> 00:13:47,339
now typically in typically right the

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,139
first you know the first go at it isn't

00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:51,600
the best one so we should we should be

00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,160
ready to iterate on that at some point

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,809
we have to stabilize because again with

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,459
accounting models you don't want the

00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:59,910
measure changing every year because it's

00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,859
this comparable over time but at least

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,959
at the beginning of the initiative think

00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:06,480
big think why collect different opinions

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,359
before before settling on one model now

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,119
what if there's not a lot of historical

00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:14,899
data in a particular organization yeah

00:14:11,119 --> 00:14:16,649
how do you determine and predict ROI or

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,679
recommendations for what you do there

00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:22,049
well in that's the case almost in most

00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:24,239
companies right yeah most companies you

00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:27,149
know they're they're getting into the ml

00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:28,829
dai field and they're testing out new

00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,929
approaches so there's not a lot of

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:32,100
historical data to to work from but it

00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:34,049
also does created an interesting

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,259
opportunity to use pilots proofs of

00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:40,379
concept proofs of value to to establish

00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,639
initial benchmarks for what is the

00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,910
current process without the application

00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,709
of these new methods on top of it versus

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,600
afterwards you know now that we have

00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,339
implemented this how is that improved

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,799
that's usually as close as you can get

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,600
to a to a controlled properly controlled

00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,850
experiment within a large organization

00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,549
right so is that like checkpoints and

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,529
then iterate for it then or so that's

00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:04,410
definitely a part of it right because

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,720
you you don't want to go in and roll out

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,999
you know a multi-year initiative for AI

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,980
n ml across the organization and then

00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:12,600
look backwards and say you know what was

00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,129
that worth you you want to be

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,139
anticipating that from the beginning to

00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,910
be able to take your measurements along

00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,169
the way of you know the actual impact

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,480
that this is having on the business

00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:24,059
which can then allow you to calculate

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,919
that that value because of course has

00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,720
these initiatives become more pervasive

00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,910
more complex they're going to have

00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,319
influence on one another and it's going

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,080
to be more and more difficult to tease

00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:34,910
out the actual benefit and

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,810
you that these these techniques are

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,940
bringing also that kind of information

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,590
who should that be shared with inside of

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,570
every session so again I think that you

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,240
know it needs to be taken up the up the

00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,950
chain right because often and I was just

00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,770
in a discussion down on the expo floor

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,090
right now about this but you know often

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,010
you know there's a misunderstanding or a

00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,230
mischaracterization often in the c-suite

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,900
all right what the you know the value of

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,660
these initiatives are in some cases you

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,910
know it's just you know bunch of geeks

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,310
playing around and in other cases it's

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,760
you know the be-all end-all savior of

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,100
the world

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,900
it's neither right it's it's something

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,460
in-between right it's it's hard work

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,580
done by intelligent people that's going

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,750
to have positive benefits but it's not

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,090
necessarily going to change everything

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,620
certainly if we don't apply it

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,510
appropriately so we need to be taking

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,880
this to this discussion and especially

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,480
in economic terms upwards because very

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,640
naturally the the the leaders of these

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,080
organizations have a responsibility to

00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,090
look after the you know the financial

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,100
aspects they definitely need to be aware

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:38,390
of that and then everyone else who's

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,280
going to be involved in this process

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,170
also benefits from being involved in

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,310
this reporting as well yeah so that they

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,620
know that what they're contributing to

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,270
and why it's valuable I you know so it's

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,590
not just about you know showing off and

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,970
saying you know here's all the you know

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,500
the additional revenue or cost savings

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,690
that we've done we're really helping the

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,420
entire organization understand in a

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,190
common language ultimately money

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,140
economics it's a common currency we all

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,170
understand you know what that means for

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,699
for the business it's a good way to

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:07,070
translate what what it is that we're

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,410
doing which unfortunately is sometimes a

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,810
little bit opaque to to our colleagues

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,070
sure I can imagine Thank You Kurt Thank

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,699
You Michael II appreciate today yeah it

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,839
was really a pleasure

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,839
