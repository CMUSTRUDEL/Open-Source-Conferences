How can machine learning decode the mysteries of life? Why are algorithms essential to enabling precision medical treatments? How do genomes encode the diversity of cells that make up humans and the signals predisposing us to diseases? Olga Troyanskaya discusses these and other questions through the prism of developing deep learning-based approaches for analysis of the human genome and explores their application to understanding human diseases ranging from autism to cancer.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,319
you've probably heard about precision

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,240
medicine if you haven't you at least I'm

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,490
sure have seen huge billboards about

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,889
different hospitals all over here in New

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,019
York City I'm sure all over the city is

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,599
you're at that are promising to sequence

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,210
your genome treat your cancer predict

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,180
your risk of Alzheimer's disease so how

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,519
do we actually make this a reality to

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,500
really be able to do that we need to

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,779
take complex human diseases and

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,929
disorders and be able to map them

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,500
specifically into the 3 billion letter

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,510
long sequence of the human genome so

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,190
here I have an example of autism and

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,290
hypertension but this is true for

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,540
diabetes for cancer for Alzheimer's

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,340
pretty much the vast majority of

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,719
diseases you would think about the

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,510
problem is we don't actually know the

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,120
specific mutations and that bulk of the

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,539
human genome here printed in the many

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,100
binders labeled by chromosomes we don't

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:57,870
know which changes in that book are

00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,730
actually the ones that will hugely

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,760
increase your risk of Alzheimer's or

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,710
predispose a child to autism or mean

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,650
that you will or will not respond to

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,299
specific blood pressure of medication

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,830
this is one of those books open so it's

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,689
a very small part of the 3 billion

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,740
letter long sequence with no punctuation

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,689
no words no sense exactly of what

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,460
anything means we know some things about

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,799
the genome we know where the genes are

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,320
here shown in blue we know some

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,020
regulatory signals here shown in green

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,450
for the vast majority of the letters in

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,030
the genome if you tell me that one of

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,159
you has a T the other one has an A it's

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,680
a four-letter alphabet so not very far

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,630
to go there is very little that we as a

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,880
community can actually tell you that

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,799
would mean and this is critical because

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,180
some of those changes will be completely

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,070
non-functional they will mean nothing

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,329
you could have a T I could have an A and

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,180
that will make no difference to your

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,970
health to our disease status our drug

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,500
response others might be very important

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,969
and functional but completely benign for

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,469
example maybe that's what means that I

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,829
have curly hair and some of you have

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,960
straight hair others might actually mean

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,070
that you have a hugely increased risk of

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,049
Alzheimer's disease

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,869
or you might or might not respond to a

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,290
specific diabetes medication so how can

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:14,459
we as computer scientists start to

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,500
address this

00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,120
seems like this is simple we just

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,409
sequence lots of people will look for

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,319
every person that has a T in that

00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:23,549
location see if they get Alzheimer's

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:24,810
look at every person that has a in that

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,730
location see if they have get

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,260
Alzheimer's and then we look at healthy

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,810
people and disease people and we just

00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,549
look at statistics unfortunately that

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,110
doesn't work especially once you go

00:02:32,549 --> 00:02:36,269
outside of genes and the problem is that

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,519
all these individuals might have the

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,989
same disease but it's very different

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,700
mutations that will underlie this

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,790
disease and this is especially true for

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,769
regulatory mutations outside of the gene

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,129
regions and that accounts for the vast

00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:53,519
majority of the genome far beyond 98% of

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,140
that 3 billion letters is what used to

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,390
be called junk DNA for a long time now

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:00,900
we've known this is not junk this is the

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,280
sequences that largely encode how genes

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,930
are turned on and off so that's the

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,109
regulatory part of the genome the

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,030
regulatory circuitry and in that space

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,200
there's so much search space that Nature

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,970
has been able to come up with many

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,609
different ways to have these mutations

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,989
and it selects against specifically the

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,190
sort of mutations that we want to study

00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,319
the ones that are likely to cause

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,419
disease so even if we sequence every

00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,579
person on earth and have lots of

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,829
information about their clinical status

00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:27,419
and disease risk we still wouldn't have

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,750
enough data to be able to do this

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:33,329
Association so instead we turn to deep

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,190
learning models and try to learn along

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,260
the genome so looking along the 3

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,169
billion letter long sequence and the

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,780
many examples of specific biochemical

00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:45,660
signals that underlie this regulatory

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,690
capacity to turn genes on and off this

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,760
regulatory model deep-sea then is able

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,130
to predict for any change like that see

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,700
shown in red a change from A to C in

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,829
that location specific biochemical

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,230
consequences there are then causing a

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,730
gene to be potentially not expressed

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,730
when it should have been so for example

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,200
in the example case and they in a

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,760
healthy individual would mean that a

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,910
special protein called transcription

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,069
factor will bind the DNA and give it a

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,949
signal to turn on a specific gene let's

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,570
say a neuronal developmental protein

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,940
that's really important for early neural

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,669
development where is the individual with

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,620
the disease in just that single letter

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,810
change to a C is going to no longer

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,580
allow the transcription factor to bind

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,580
and thus that particular protein won't

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,840
be turned on and is not going to act

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,330
when it needs to in early development

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,510
potentially predisposing that child to

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,510
autism

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,060
