How can machine learning decode the mysteries of life? Why are algorithms essential to enabling precision medical treatments? How do genomes encode the diversity of cells that make up humans and the signals predisposing us to diseases? Olga Troyanskaya discusses these and other questions through the prism of developing deep learning-based approaches for analysis of the human genome and explores their application to understanding human diseases ranging from autism to cancer.
