[Music]

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,560
[Music]

00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:10,029
[Music]

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,300
well good morning I bet you mean you

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,190
woke up you didn't think you're gonna

00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,740
think about artificial intelligence and

00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,300
MasterCard or as my wife says Nick the

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,110
only way you have intelligence is with

00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,580
artificial intelligence yourself right

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:29,700
but we at MasterCard and by the way who

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,590
has a MasterCard I thank you for your

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,650
business the rest of you we'll take care

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,970
of you by the end of the conference ok

00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,400
but when you think of MasterCard this is

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,869
what you think of right well I'm going

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,140
to tell you something if you take away

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,979
one thing today this should be it

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:49,050
MasterCard is not a credit card company

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:52,140
the sister Mary Frances would say no no

00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,720
no no no no no it's not a credit card

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,780
company mastercards a technology company

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,750
and our technology is being embedded in

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,190
everything from the connected car to

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,979
being able to order groceries from your

00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,740
refrigerator not to mention our core

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,610
business which is to protect those

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,750
master cards that are out there we are a

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:18,060
technology company first and foremost

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:21,030
one of our missions is safety one of our

00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,820
missions is protecting you the person

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,180
not the card it's the person behind the

00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,140
card this is our world this is my data

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:35,160
set and as a data scientist I love it

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:37,470
alright 2.5 billion customers are out

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,269
there using master cards and the rest of

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,630
you will be converted by the end of the

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:44,250
night

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:47,930
ok 23,000 financial institutions that we

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,910
have to work with 50 million merchants

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,810
worldwide in 210 countries and

00:02:50,910 --> 00:03:00,209
territories across the globe that is

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:03,840
scale that is scale and by the way we

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:10,320
processed 74 billion transactions every

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,040
year in less than 135 milliseconds think

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,590
about that

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,669
the only way to do this scale is with

00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,350
artificial intelligence and we have bet

00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,790
heavily here

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,380
we have three divisions that use

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,870
artificial intelligence and their use

00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,400
cases are staggering bright Tyrion is an

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,680
entire division of Master Card does

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,780
nothing but artificial intelligence new

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,330
data is using artificial intelligence to

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,130
provide passive biometrics for that

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,720
safety and security the way you hold

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,820
your phone the way you swipe against it

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,780
all unique to you and the only way

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,550
that's going to come through is with

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,860
artificial intelligence and then we have

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,040
vocal link which is working on real-time

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:51,190
payments not near real-time real-time

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,860
payments so these are our investments

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,710
this is why we're here today this is why

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,000
we love our artificial intelligence

00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,370
here's a use case if you can imagine

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,410
this fraud is growing this is our major

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,780
use case it's going to go from 24

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,080
billion to 34 billion in less than three

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,850
years double-digit growth we have to

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,220
fight against this because most of that

00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:16,020
fraud is now moving online into the

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:18,130
digital space and we have less than 135

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,790
milliseconds to understand that that's

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:24,040
the right transaction or if it's not and

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,330
if you can imagine what we're doing now

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,800
is we're applying a hundred and fifty

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,720
variables to that 150 variables now five

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,090
to eight years ago is 15 that's

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,460
artificial intelligence and the only way

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,780
we do that is by architecting behind the

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,580
scenes and the only way that we can

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,160
architect behind the scenes is by using

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,210
partners so if you take away something

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,170
else today understand two things one

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,430
your MasterCard is safe and secure -

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,170
you'll need a partner when that comes to

00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,260
artificial intelligence and you need a

00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,970
partner at scale that's why we work with

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,030
partners like Dell technologies and

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:04,000
Intel to understand how we can move the

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,790
cpu closer to the edge in order to

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,770
create these computations because if you

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,460
don't use a partner you will fall behind

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,640
a partner will allow you to innovate

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,310
faster they will allow you to succeed in

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:23,170
your mission they will allow you to

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:25,090
start something priceless that's the

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,530
power of artificial intelligence that's

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,169
what this conference is all about I

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,969
thank you for your time and shamelessly

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:35,049
please come

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:36,939
at one o'clock in beat okay for those of

00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:39,279
you who don't have a master part I will

00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,709
have applications thank you very much

00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,369
enjoy spectacular day here at O'Reilly

00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:44,369
AI conference
