hi I'm PACU Nathan with O'Reilly Media

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,200
and here at the O'Reilly artificial

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,570
intelligence conference in New York City

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,090
and today it's pleasure to be joined by

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,769
Prince Uche principal at Deloitte

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,639
Consulting it's very good to meet you a

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,109
pleasure meeting you

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,670
wonderful I wanted to ask you about

00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:24,000
where Deloitte is positioned right now

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,550
with respect to a I I understand Gardner

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,070
has placed Deloitte in the Magic

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,180
Quadrant yeah it was a great news that

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,980
we get recognized in the market for the

00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,690
investments we're doing in AI so we're

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,120
taking the I very serious because we

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,090
believe a I will change the market so

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,950
initially and we've been always in the

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,280
topic quadrant especially around

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,980
execution and completion of vision but

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,170
this year we were pioneering the idea of

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,520
how to apply I into the business and

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,160
integrated into the functions of the

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,410
business so we were first in execution

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,420
for a few years now we are first in

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,129
execution and vision and the completion

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,870
of vision is what will put us on the top

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,020
of the quadrant now it's not a surprise

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,750
for us because again it's one of our

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,030
market offering that we take to market

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,340
we build talent around it we build

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,450
assets around it and we build alliances

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,820
that make our go-to-market service to

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,670
our clients more integrated into an

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,680
ecosystem so it's not like we go in and

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,350
fix a problem and get out we're becoming

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,810
more like a partnership with our clients

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,640
to help them actually bring the I so the

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,140
front of their business and change the

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,939
way they're doing the business and then

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,460
bringing in an ecosystem move the

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,140
ecosystem is a combination of basically

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,210
call it assets which basically

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,899
algorithms built that they can deploy

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,570
and run in the backend alliances we have

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,909
alliances with Apple with Google with

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,460
Amazon and with all the other big

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,729
vendors even we have alliances with IBM

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,350
Watson and what we do with SAS what we

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,909
do with all of these alliances is just

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,429
like leverage what ABI is they have keep

00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:05,439
we have with what we have and it bring

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:07,569
the talent and the the breadth of

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,819
experience in different areas for every

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,160
business and help the business achieve

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,799
their goals

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,049
fantastic so it's a complete view of how

00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:19,180
we implement the I it's not a silent

00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:21,250
vision and that's why the execution and

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,230
the vision has to go hand in hand and

00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,569
that I think what make us on the top of

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,180
the quadrant with the Gardner fantastic

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,860
now could you speak to how that develops

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,170
competitive advantage for for your

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,879
customers yeah so the competitive

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,700
advantage is a combination of components

00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,530
to get there first they have to have an

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,930
understanding of what they are not

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,060
leveraging a lot of the clients today

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,700
they build their intelligence based on

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,260
the data they have access to most of the

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,579
time the data they have access to is the

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,010
better they have access to for the last

00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:51,910
10 years interesting but there's a lot

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,530
of dark data

00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,780
you never leveraged there never really

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:58,450
tried to look into it because technology

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,519
is either expensive or the work to do

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,010
that it's going to become you have to

00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,280
re-engineer the way they run into or

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,859
extract data so the way we are trying to

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,650
handle that is helping our clients

00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:14,530
leverage these dark datasets try to

00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,389
leverage that data to build insights the

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,400
insights will help them understand

00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,290
better the business their onic so that's

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,769
one component of competitive advantage

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,079
the other component is how to activate

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,000
these insights how to activate them in

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,530
the way that relieves an impact will

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,079
have an impact on the results of their

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,599
business sometimes it changes the way

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,480
they do the work so that's the second

00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,919
component so activating the insights

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,410
leveraging data to find insights and the

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,599
third component is building the

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,230
ecosystem program which basically means

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,180
if they have talent or lack of talent we

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,010
can support a bath if they have a lack

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,500
of infrastructure we can help them build

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,180
that if they feel their infrastructure

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,639
and talents is there but yet they feel

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,829
out of the world we help them get

00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,919
integrated into a bigger better

00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:06,250
ecosystem so they can execute data

00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:08,110
extraction the inside activation in

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,060
cheaper and most

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,640
like more most more effective for them

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,230
so it's it's a combination of the

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,140
components that give our clients again

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,880
better advantage some of our competitors

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,300
I would say they call it stress more on

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,390
insights alway extracting insight is

00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:28,960
powerful but not knowing how to activate

00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,940
insights is a missing link in the chain

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,930
the third one which is even more

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,910
important ok you can build a pilot you

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,580
can extract an insight you can activate

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,890
it but it's just a pilot what about

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,210
having an ongoing service what about

00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:47,680
looking into multiple areas multiple

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:49,720
silo days in your business where you can

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,880
connect them all together to have a

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,290
platform to be more effective in the way

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,490
you do a service or you sell your

00:04:53,290 --> 00:05:00,400
product or you activate your business so

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,040
doing all of inside generation insight

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,110
activation and actually building the

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,600
system or the ecosystem to effectively

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,500
deliver that that's what we feel is

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,000
making us look more of a good partner

00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,340
with our clients and to deliver this

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,260
value it sounds like the the third

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,840
component is also speaking toward

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,000
roadmap these areas really need to plan

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,650
that out it is their own map it is their

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,330
call of the blueprint it is about

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,790
understanding what they are they have

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,860
what technology they actually own yeah

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,350
what the process is that they kind of

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,690
built around their systems and what

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,970
analytics they built it's a component of

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,280
four okay and on top of these four do

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,890
they have the people to achieve the

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,320
vision they have different skills with

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,780
different areas so just understanding

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,790
all of these components the data the

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,370
analytics the technology the people and

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,950
the processes and threat rang kind of

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,470
not necessarily re-engineer but optimize

00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,750
in a way that they can leverage their

00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,580
dark data you can extract their insights

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,960
they can activate their insights and

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,169
they can run their business in an

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:08,140
impactful way excellent now in terms of

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,870
dark data with this sometimes be

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,310
comprised of say data exhaust or what

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,190
would have been considered data exhaust

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,950
in previous time well previously all the

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,230
on-premise

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,000
they've been looking at call it risk

00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,150
data financial data marketing data

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,160
they've been like aligned and a

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,500
organized structure way okay

00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,660
that's required money to maintain of

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,180
course people to look into things to

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,370
build tables fields attributes rows and

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,740
columns when we start getting into the

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,140
big theater realm everything changed

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,360
because you start talked about a lot of

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,120
data within the firm and outside the

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,070
firm now you can see in the market a lot

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,410
of people focus on the data that sits

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,570
outside the walls of the firm social

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,790
media data Internet of Things data and

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,610
even data that they can leverage to

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,740
build in size but that is external there

00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,840
that could be dark as well because they

00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,760
never leverage before but we talk also

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,250
more about the internal data within the

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,210
walls there's a lot of data in the form

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:11,450
of images how many times or for the last

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,670
10 20 years our clients have a lot of

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,310
financial contracts legal contracts they

00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,560
have a lot of documents about everything

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,220
they sign if it's a mortgage if it's a

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,380
deal if it's a a partnership all of

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,640
these contracts scanned run thrown in a

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,840
PDF in the backend

00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,670
no but they really look at them right

00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,470
there's a lot of every time you make a

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,690
phone call to a credit card and that

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:37,100
phone call gets recorded that voice

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:38,960
record sits somewhere and a low quality

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,790
I would say it's multi-channel low

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,070
quality voice record that nobody really

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:47,090
analyzed look at interesting so voice

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:49,400
records images text emails even things

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,350
so this is by itself is a huge body of

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,170
dark data that have been leveraged today

00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,580
that technology is enabling and there

00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,910
are a lot of api's out there

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,730
google has Amazon Apple and as well as

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:04,550
we have assets where you can extract

00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:07,070
from these images analyze these voice

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,480
records to look into all this backlog of

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,640
things that never will looked at to

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,410
understand customer experience better to

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,720
understand the needs of your customers

00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,940
how to market and optimize marketing

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,380
spending and campaigning better so that

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,020
is the value

00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,420
and if I can add one more thing is

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,300
sometimes and which was more effective

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,310
things back in the days within the firm

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,560
the data is siloed

00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,539
they don't integrate we're using

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,020
technology now to to merge the data

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,030
together to make it more uniform act

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,310
more a fabric like to be able to extract

00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,440
my science I can imagine that that

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,550
requires a lot of cultural change in

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,230
some organizations it does culture and

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,930
training and so we have to adapt to

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,790
change give you example and I believe

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,010
that our data scientists back in the

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,140
days they used to know one or two of the

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,560
packages out there to tell to do the

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,300
work today they need to do that they

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,190
have to do more of the training around

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,470
the new open sources like Python the

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,420
SPARC and C and C sharp and other that's

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,670
out there and what's interesting with

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,340
our alliances like with Apple and Google

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:16,070
and Amazon we're doing eating bootcamp

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,700
training on Google API and Amazon api's

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:22,390
why because our data scientists need

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,470
just not to be always careful of

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,080
understanding what's the latest and the

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,990
most powerful tool out there that they

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,910
can use to help our clients so yeah it's

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,470
culture change within our firm talk to

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,450
serve our clients and its culture in

00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,850
shape for our clients to understand that

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,680
the world is changing right bring in

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,330
that ecosystem again exactly they're

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,400
always changing the things that you used

00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,740
to do especially in middle office back

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,540
office and relational work all of that I

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,700
would say it's all around the cost

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,500
reduction and effectiveness but also all

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,470
of that has to be redesigned

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,330
re-engineered the processes has to be

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,880
rated rewritten the technology is

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:01,720
already shifting so yes it requires a

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,850
lot of change management there fantastic

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,220
one question I know that Deloitte has

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,960
been using the term the age of with I

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,960
want to understand a little bit more

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:16,640
about the history of this and and just

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,050
dig into the I kind in the 60s and

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,670
everybody went to think about the a I

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,700
think they're all but we're gonna come

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,370
take over the world and just eliminate

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,290
human beings there is something right

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,600
about it

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,160
it's actually carried over the years and

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,440
everybody starts thinking when I'm gonna

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,980
activating AI in my business

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,690
am i eliminating humans so we start

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,320
realizing it's not at all

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,690
the AI is overrated at least for now the

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,810
the way this being the perception about

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,000
the AI about taking over jobs is not

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,860
necessarily accurate right maybe in a

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,140
hundred years from now when AI takes the

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,210
next level or next shift and the

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:57,820
evolvement we may v start thinking about

00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:00,100
even eliminating some jobs but yeah

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,380
today only take or I would say

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,050
automation will only take from AI which

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,120
is segment of it the low-hanging fruit

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,730
of the jobs special about data entry

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,530
under the extraction what we believe and

00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,510
we start campaigning around that in

00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,720
Deloitte two years ago and even before

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:20,140
the age of web is we're saying that it's

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,570
not the age of humans or machines it's

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,330
the age of humans with machines we

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,300
believe machines and AI should be an

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:30,580
Augmented tool it should be the bionic

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,410
arm provided to humans to provide to do

00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,530
the jobs better more effective

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,450
so it's an Aleve in AI not artificial

00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,360
intelligence we believe in the eye as

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,840
augmented intelligence which is human

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,290
and machine together now that's going to

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,620
require a lot more feedback loops a lot

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:52,090
more notions of human intervention in AI

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,880
can imagine this is kind of

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,410
collaboration rolling yeah it is and the

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,350
change management you mentioned earlier

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,340
is very 100% right what's happening now

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,980
a dot so there are early adapters of AI

00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:08,050
terms that adapt in bi early and those

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,340
who are doing adoption of AI early

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,250
they're trying to look into their

00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,560
systems and say what is the right mix

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,680
what is the right balance between having

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,900
AI and humans our machine and humans how

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,450
much machine how much a human and it

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:25,870
depends also in what level of your job

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:28,630
you need AI but like for example if you

00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,000
are a c-suite level your I to you is

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,649
basically -

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,480
that gives you a drill down capability

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,519
to understand every moving part in your

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,189
business yeah I will help integrate the

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,319
era together build metrics and track

00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:42,269
things if you're in a lower level

00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,100
depending on your function you may need

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,470
the I to help you better understand how

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,639
you campaign in your marketing but

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,610
you're not going to Sara Lee rely

00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,600
heavily on it you will use it to

00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,670
understand the market better to build

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,500
insights and then you start thinking

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,620
okay how I can use the insights and

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,509
better addressing my customers and yet

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,509
if that's is the answer

00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:04,920
am I making enough impact and if I'm

00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,620
making enough impact am i spending

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,029
enough on AI and to go with the loop to

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,889
see okay what's the right balance

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:13,470
between AI and human and how you

00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:16,230
integrate that into a process I can

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,329
imagine over the the period of the past

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,040
couple of years you've seen a wide

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:21,540
variety of different verticals different

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,930
different stages of maturity for

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,779
companies its it's not all the same in

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:30,389
each company not really early adapters I

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:34,139
would say they have the competitive

00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:37,620
advantage when and again it's about

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:40,199
believing that AI is going to change

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,809
your business this believers they are

00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:44,160
coming to believe now that maybe they're

00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:47,459
late in the game and they're pushing

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,089
harder so some of the clients we serve

00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:53,009
and surprisingly big firms adapt the AI

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,319
slower because you know the change

00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,160
management will take impact there and

00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:59,059
mostly

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,920
their adaption to AI is it triggered by

00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:04,529
responding to regulatory asks in other

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,209
word they have regulatory asks to do

00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:08,610
risk metrics index measurements and

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:11,100
build things to address regulatory needs

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,529
around say Sequoia and basil and others

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,990
so they build a platform data scientists

00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,779
to help addressing back once that's the

00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,699
maturing you have now the capability and

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,279
there's like okay how we can tweak our

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:26,009
capabilities to start addressing things

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,259
that are internal or even how to grow

00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:29,819
our our business in a different way or

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,180
looking into our business in a different

00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:35,670
way so while smaller firms are more

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,080
nimble they adapted they look at the

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,870
value they see the impact quickly

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,400
and they start building on it so yeah

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,700
different maturity levels for different

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,440
firms and even different aggressiveness

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,180
in adapting the I between firms

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,590
depending on how much they believe and

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,570
how that integrate with their vision

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,630
right some are probably more automated

00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,490
maybe more people more machines is the

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:00,210
trade off exactly exactly

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,890
interesting it sounds also like in in

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,810
terms of introducing regulatory

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,460
structure in companies initially there

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,500
are risks for that but then eventually

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,080
that commit sure and opportunities a lot

00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,920
so even the regulator's the way they

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,720
asking the firm's today to do things

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,910
changing over the time so basically in

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,010
the beginning like let's say as an

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,520
example Basile was one was very basic

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,800
based on certain criteria for firms to

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,380
respond to and at some point they bent

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,810
went into Basel to then paddle three and

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,750
now they're introducing ideas about they

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,670
need to understand behavioral risk let's

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,820
say and that's in the market trading as

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,860
an example so when a regulator the

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,500
regulatory asking the firm's to start

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,140
looking into transactional data and

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,620
start looking at behaviors these firms

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,330
has to build AI functions not just

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,100
building metrics and simple regressions

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,410
they have to go into the depth

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,640
understanding different criteria of data

00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,250
and even building insights of

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,350
alternative there in front of them so

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,900
all of this is driving the business to

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,910
adapt AI indirectly if they're not

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,670
really doing it directly because they

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:11,310
have to address that need so basically

00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:15,360
what I'm saying is adoption and what

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:17,610
change is coming adoption of AI is today

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,670
I believe everybody believe it's

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:22,680
becoming it's a fact how quick you need

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,200
to adapt to AI that's the question and

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,330
how far behind you are depending on when

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,460
you started also another question right

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,780
right some of these transformations can

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,820
take a lot of time it will take time

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,280
it's to have an investor exactly so

00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,710
depending on what business how big is

00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,830
the business and what industry yeah and

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,450
again tell you that we like I can say

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,520
that in the financial services we

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,500
believe which were I serve most of the

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,210
time

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,530
that the financial services are very

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,970
advanced Mei actually not really

00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,340
healthcare as an example they are doing

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,590
a lot of advances in AI and other sub

00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,990
industries and sectors they start doing

00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,520
more they're moving towards a I am much

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:03,860
more faster than we anticipated

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,930
interesting so sometimes it's not that

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,880
the regulatory push make you start

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,490
building like analytics arm and your

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,110
firm and leveraging that sometimes that

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,600
they feel it's better way to do business

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,819
their margin are thin and the best way

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,620
to do it is to involve AI to have a

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,380
competitive advantage to grow their

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,720
business so also the way the approach is

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,329
different you're saying can you give an

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,310
example out of healthcare in healthcare

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,560
the using it to understand better the

00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,200
effective medicine they better using

00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,990
give using it and even to understand the

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,300
behavior of people giving example when

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,460
the Lu trials of the medicine back in

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,120
the days it was very difficult to track

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,130
it over a population of patients because

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,860
they are silent because data is not

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,340
there even recently and D you in our

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:57,200
University in Dallas and Deloitte we

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:59,120
hosted a doctor who actually does treat

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,640
for certain sickness I forget the name

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,650
but the way he did it it was a lot of

00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,200
paper to work trails that he was

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,660
actually tracking for ten years and he

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,970
came to us like how about I can use data

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,070
science nei we used the I we did image

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,110
recognition we extracted all the stuff

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,430
both start building a trends for him and

00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,720
we started defying from thousands of

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,330
combinations that he was trying to

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,040
direct him where to go and actually the

00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,370
effectiveness of the medicine is working

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,900
on it's like if you changed the game for

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,030
him I'm just giving an example yeah now

00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,560
again when I've talked about patients

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,110
and as an example when you start pulling

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,480
different patients data together and

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,940
tracking things not just by one lab

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,590
multiples and looking at the trials you

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,020
can have much more insights today

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,960
technologies today is helping a lot if

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,360
you notice if you are googling online a

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,000
lot of us now instead of googling

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,120
anything we just ask the voice are you

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,320
just prick so the behavior of how even

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,460
we interact with technology changing

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,560
yeah interesting there was another point

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,120
to a you know one thing that I've heard

00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,430
I want to run by you

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,730
I think a lot of people look at the

00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:13,370
introduction of hardware really core

00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,510
technology maybe they're using GPUs now

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,270
they're doing some deep learning

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,610
interviews but it's not really the the

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,190
machines so much that are the change it

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,250
seems like there's a process that's hard

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:28,750
it's the way we are treating the machine

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,820
in other word algorithm building and

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,260
regressions and the gradient boost as an

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,880
example if you're gonna go technical the

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,830
gradient goes like in the open source

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,590
now is being introduced as a machine

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:44,270
learning technique in it and in actually

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,380
in its origin it's another form of what

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,930
we used to use as a multivariate

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,390
regression but we're trying to taking

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:52,280
the error and rebuild on more

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,650
intelligence understanding that I'm

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,730
animated way so what I'm trying to say

00:19:54,650 --> 00:20:00,890
is today we are trying to take what we

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,920
knew before and apply it on the new

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,500
technology that's evolving and the

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,830
interaction is getting richer every day

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,750
so if you read about how AI is evolving

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,390
they said exponentially evolving

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,010
actually the more you adapted the more

00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:19,250
people like it the more people see the

00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:22,310
impact of it the the evolvement of VI

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,700
will they grow exponentially as we would

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,320
expect so yes I agree with you the way

00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,480
you interact with the machine will

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,070
define the impact it's not the machine

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,890
it's how you interact with it that's why

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,470
we say it's the human with machine human

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,180
is the major factor here excellent thank

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,630
you very much principal thank you Thanks

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,630
