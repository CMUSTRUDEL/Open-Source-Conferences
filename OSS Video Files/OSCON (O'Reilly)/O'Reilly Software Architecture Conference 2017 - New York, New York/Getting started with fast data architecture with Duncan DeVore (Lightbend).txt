	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
hi this is mike henderson from soccer

00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,220
architecture in new york i'm here with

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,049
Duncan Devore Duncan how you doing I'm

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,570
doing well thank you so you're with

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,450
light Bend and we had a conversation in

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,190
Europe six months ago or so can you

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,199
catch me up on what you guys have been

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,730
up to since that time yeah our

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,260
conversation in London was about

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,810
reactive architectures and what that

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,539
means to us as a company and that's

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,060
still one of the primary cores of what

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,890
we do another thing that I wanted to

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,170
mention that I don't not sure I

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,290
mentioned while I was in London one of

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,899
the core tenets of our company is it

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,180
sounds kind of simple but it's it's

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,820
pretty complex is the idea we like to

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,250
build things at work right and so one of

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,140
the things for a key for example I

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,750
always wanted to buy line for it to be

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,780
it just works I've used a cure for a

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,570
long time and but at the same time we're

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,920
also pragmatists in the sense that we're

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,149
not going to reinvent the wheel and

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,300
everything where it doesn't need to be

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,610
reinvented and I think one of the things

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,610
that has come from the notion of being

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:11,610
reactive in the background has been this

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:15,570
whole idea of you know processing of

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:17,250
data big data back in the 90s you know

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,380
left hudes and all these kinds of things

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,590
all kinds of data and such they were

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,689
being processed in a batch mode but now

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,110
that's no longer the case right its

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,570
agreement is streaming exactly and I

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,369
think one of the neat examples or kind

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,520
of like an analogies you can imagine if

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:38,130
say for example Google were to batch

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,930
their data and update their index every

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,060
hour but say yahoo were being were to

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,000
stream it in that would put google at a

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,250
competitive disadvantage or significant

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,799
disadvantage so the idea is streaming of

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,710
data and processing that in real term

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,560
are real time there's where i think the

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,540
complexity begins to arrive right and it

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,780
becomes it begins to become difficult

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,920
and the problem is is that the volume of

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,319
data that is coming in is staggering its

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,630
enormous so there's a lot of different

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,540
things that one has to

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,430
due to deal with that they have to be

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,900
able to filter out the noise you can

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,660
think about when you're walking down the

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,170
street and you're going to a particular

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,980
location there's so much input rate cars

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:29,720
people signs whether all this stuff but

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,610
you need to focus you're actually your

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,310
brain is filtering out a tremendous

00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:37,310
amount of stuff and the same is true for

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,140
for fast data and that's a process of

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,210
learning and how to do that the other

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,370
thing that your brain is doing is a fast

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,860
mean screaming screaming yet I'm going

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,640
to use the term interchangeably here the

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,610
other thing is your brain is also auto

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,700
correcting so as you go down the street

00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,950
and perhaps some you know you didn't cap

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,050
catch the sign change to don't walk

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,750
right and a car takes all he stopped

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,850
right and adjust for that so there's so

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,160
many things going on and each one of

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,090
those things is a little data point that

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,500
has arrived and you've processed the

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,350
human brain is far more complex than

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,720
even the best of computers so but the

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:20,530
idea behind what we're trying to do is

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,850
been around for a long time in AI and

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,190
essentially when it boils down to is

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,530
kind of something that has been around

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,540
for 50 plus years and that's the notion

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,370
of something called a feedback loop and

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,470
control so in other words you're

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,880
receiving data and you're processing

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,640
that data you can decision you're making

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,740
just you know small decisions and you're

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,020
kind of building and kind of like a

00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,459
cluster of things that are making

00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,620
decisions and do we learn from those

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,070
decisions so that we kind of self heal

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,459
and reacts well exactly in the future so

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,440
that takes us to the next notion is

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,170
exactly we have to learn so there there

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,090
are statistical regression and linear

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,610
not only linear algebraic you know

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,510
equations that are already out there

00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,709
optimization routines and stuff like

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,680
that and and those can be tuned right

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,060
just like you would to nakorn car engine

00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,209
depending on the type of race it's it's

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,489
going to be in and over time you can you

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,230
can historically to those to give you

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,479
better results it's like your thermostat

00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,120
on your house right it's going to learn

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,070
over time especially in a smart house

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,810
how to keep the temperature because

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,580
perhaps your insulation isn't the best

00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,620
or it's better than I mean during the

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,220
day timing during the day exactly to

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:38,240
save money exactly and so the streaming

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,370
of data fast data brings in or brings to

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,070
the forefront a new way to process that

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,340
data and really what is called near

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,550
real-time sub-second and then making

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,210
decisions and then adjusting on the fly

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,639
now the problem becomes is that again as

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,310
I had mentioned the volume of data that

00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,199
you're capturing and processing is

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,539
beyond the capabilities of processing

00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,660
you know of a I so one of the things

00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:08,270
that's required is every particular use

00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,639
case for that data you have to determine

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,520
what we would call an acceptable Delta

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,350
of error so if I'm going to operate

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,300
within the confines of an error say

00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,729
between five percent and eight percent

00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,039
with ten percent as long as they can

00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:23,990
keep my error rate within that then I'm

00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,490
good errors are going to happen there's

00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,680
nothing you can do about it it's

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,560
impossible to know to create the perfect

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,300
system where our architecture comes in

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,580
is the notion behind streaming requires

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,260
real-time processing and in any real

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,000
time processing situation or near

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,090
real-time processing situation you have

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,030
to have elasticity right and all the

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,210
components of the reactive manifesto in

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,160
order to stay up and running real-time

00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,289
doesn't work real well if pieces are

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,590
failing and this is real time in the

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,940
cloud in the cloud exactly yeah real

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,099
hardware device sir right I mean it

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,990
could be local cloud it could be you

00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:06,289
know hybrid cloud it could be full on

00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,360
our cloud but the idea is you know the

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:10,190
same applies the security and everything

00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,400
you have to be able to process that data

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,080
as its arriving as opposed to get a

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,430
bunch of data sit down do the research

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,800
figure out what the answer is and then

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,300
respond and how does someone get going I

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,520
noticed you we have a book here is that

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,820
yeah being right if from being yeah Dean

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,650
wobblers are fast data expert and he has

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,389
a book called fast date architectures

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,010
for streaming applications that a good

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,870
good start with yeah it's a great book

00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,390
that kind of understand the problem and

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,840
explain it and we also have

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,090
a nice little card which kind of walks

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,300
through some of the different components

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,220
that could be part of a fast data system

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,660
and how you're going to build your

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,940
system I think one of the other things

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,250
that's interesting I had the pleasure

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,950
working on a system in the 90s which was

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,130
essentially kind of somewhere between

00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:02,360
batch and fast data and there's also a

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:04,040
social aspect of this that one has to

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,450
grapple with them in our particular

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,820
situation was first on the actual

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,670
company and it was to basically take a

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,910
look at their investment strategies and

00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:16,340
run them through a list artificial

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,690
intelligence engine and take a look at

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,970
all the possibilities of where the

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,860
company could invest the one thing that

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,160
caught is completely off guard is as

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,310
when we went to sell it there was pushed

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,320
back because the folks that handled the

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:34,010
money they were concerned that this

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,360
thing would replace them and so as you

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,400
give in to it could have been 20 years

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,470
of 30 yeah yeah so as you get into these

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,150
kinds of concepts that's there's the

00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:44,390
social impacts that you also have to

00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,770
consider too and the idea was is no it's

00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,900
not meant to replace your it's meant to

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,120
all advanced you so so going sounds like

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,950
that like you know why are we going to

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,920
need developers if you have software we

00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:58,790
build itself heels attack salt adjusts

00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,250
and self maintain so is that not the

00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:03,860
same thing I mean are we going to get to

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,590
a point to where a piece of software is

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,150
totally self healing and autonomous so

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,940
that's a great question i mean that's

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,320
the infamous AI i mean i just read an

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,150
article on Ellen mosque is very

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:19,430
concerned about where as going I think

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,100
that in the future down the road is a

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:25,070
possibility but I still think we're far

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,110
away from it I believe my personal

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,670
opinion is where at least ten years and

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,300
what are the elements to get there

00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:35,000
quicker just processing power being able

00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,770
to orchestrate machines working together

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,690
yeah so like you can look at a problem

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,040
if you're an optimization engineer you

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,660
can look at a problem you can make the

00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,140
decision of what is noise and what is it

00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,420
moist

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,950
computers you know they're still having

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,450
difficulties doing that there's so many

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,150
things that the human brain can do that

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,740
computers can't do yet and it's still a

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,120
long ways off yet we may have one

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,670
computer that can please just really

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,140
well but it can't drive a car at the

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,710
same time and do all these different

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,140
things it's very linear focused and so

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,110
the idea fast data one of the challenges

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,660
behind fast data is the tuning of it an

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:11,510
e-commerce solution has a significantly

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,690
different potentially Delta ver than say

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:17,570
perhaps an energy company would have two

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:20,330
totally different genres of business and

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,550
you can't just generically apply a

00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,170
solution to it right there's there's a

00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,240
lot of complexities there that have to

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,310
be considered and self-healing is

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,310
different than like so far connecting

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,140
yeah yo yes absolutely yes you're having

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,730
that thought process to do that I think

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,310
that's an excellent point yeah and the

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,570
other thing too is self healing is

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,990
basically keeping the system running as

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,030
opposed to designing a system that would

00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,430
keep itself running right again I think

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,710
you're always going to need a designer

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,350
outside of until computers become

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,960
self-aware and we have Skynet you're

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:57,110
always going to need a designer it's

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,580
just they're just not there yet so don't

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:02,390
if you look forward and we have this

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:04,520
discussion in London and six months what

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,680
would you like to say changes for you

00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,450
folks that like that and what would you

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,870
like to see change in the industry in

00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,760
general so I think what changes us are

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,580
changes for us a light then is the fact

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,670
that that our fast data platform will be

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,070
becoming more mature or alpha release

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,970
will have been out and so forth and

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:28,370
website coming timing-wise I believe its

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,540
neck the beginning of next quarter I got

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,520
a double check i don't remember off the

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:36,050
top of my head but so i think that will

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,820
be out there and that will begin to get

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,680
some traction I think the exciting thing

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,860
is the technologies that is still upon

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,460
or battle tested in the field ack i mean

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,860
if there's tons of stuff spark and and

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,080
all these different parts elasticsearch

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,060
and so forth but so I think that's

00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,790
exciting to begin to get some of that

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,650
feedback and begin to learn how to tune

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,290
that system get to know the system you

00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,640
know it's very much like anything a car

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,780
whatever you have to get learned and

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,970
know it a little bit it's got its own

00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,590
personality and then to be able to craft

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,930
that for the individual customer that's

00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:12,830
where that how are we going to abstract

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,740
a generic protocol that that it makes it

00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,360
easier for the customer to be able to

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,850
utilize the features that fascinated

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,460
provides a generic extraction the custom

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,330
to that particular yeah kind of think

00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,700
think of it kind of like a

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,430
domain-specific language hell I can set

00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,400
up some anomaly detection rules or

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,690
whatever for my specific use case etc so

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,670
on Duncan we look forward to that

00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,760
conversation thank you look forward to

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,760
it

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:45,149
