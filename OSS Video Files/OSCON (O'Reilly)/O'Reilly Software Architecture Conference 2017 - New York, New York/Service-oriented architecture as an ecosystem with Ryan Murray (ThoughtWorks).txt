hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:04,470
software architecture conference in New

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,390
York City I'm here with Ryan Murray Ryan

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,830
how you doing well thanks my dear what

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,510
thought works and you run a group

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,400
they're called the digital platform

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,900
strategy yeah correct I found it a

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,059
digital platform strategy sort of

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,080
grouped to help bring together the

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,029
experiences we're having with our

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,830
clients around evolving their digital

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,050
platforms their architectures and their

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,400
infrastructure that support their teams

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,890
building great digital experience and

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,750
part of that evolving with your

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,210
customers is that part of their digital

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,679
transformation absolutely we're looking

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,210
a lot at what are the foundational

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,920
business capabilities and assets the

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,030
things that make them special that make

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,649
them competitive in the digital world

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,360
there's a lot of disruption happening

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,800
and basically organizations that have

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,030
been in the market for a long time have

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,620
tremendous assets and they're actually

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,000
ahead of a lot of these startups and

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,440
these disruptors right but they've got

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,329
to unlock them if they're going to be

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,100
successful otherwise the risk is to

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,050
start up to a private and their unique

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,699
properties and what they have so how do

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,590
you expose those unique properties is

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,440
that through microservices or how does

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,510
your digital platform strategy help them

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,340
expose their uniqueness to their

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,719
partners yeah it's a great question you

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,369
know a lot of talk about micro services

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,260
out there right now focuses a lot on the

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,580
techniques about how we actually create

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,530
a service-oriented architecture on the

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,090
small the middle scale breaking down

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,220
bottle it's for example what we're

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,049
really focusing on a lot also is what is

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,119
a service-oriented sure architecture

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,500
look like as an ecosystem so how do we

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,000
strategically think about the business

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,500
capabilities or assets that are most

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,880
important and then make sure that we

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,350
emerge of those first and so we're

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,790
trying to really talk about technology

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,500
strategy being at the heart of business

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,360
strategy and making sure we're aligning

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,560
the work we do in micro services to a

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,780
company's business strategy and

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,180
technology strategy can you unpack that

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,220
a little bit do you mean a tech strategy

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,799
that we're going to move from a monolith

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,450
to a micro service company or we're

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,759
going to use this programming language

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,770
or this methodology or we're going to be

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,290
agile what what strategy are you

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,240
unpacking there it's a good point we as

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,189
a digital platform Strategy Group are

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,930
focused mostly on what we think of as

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,100
platform architecture so there's the

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,899
aspects of the service-oriented

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,700
architecture i was talking about aspects

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,640
of delivery infrastructure what paths

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,049
and these other topics the the top line

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,700
digital strategy as well around you know

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,740
content and engaging the customers like

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,569
you said language strategy felt works

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,770
does all of those things but the digital

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:11,120
platform group is really about building

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,200
that

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,000
foundational platform how do we think

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,159
about modern service-oriented

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,989
architecture but in heavily prioritize

00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,900
the business needs and so what kind of

00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:22,970
value can you bring to a partner the

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,920
digital platforms strategy what kind of

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,599
value do you bring so the digital

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,400
telephone strategy starts off as a writ

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,019
as a strategy activity where we do some

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,670
discovery and we make sure that because

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:33,829
I mentioned before we're lining the work

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,690
that you're doing to actual business

00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,459
goals right and so if I'm doing

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,870
microservices I may be doing

00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,459
microservices from a technical

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,989
technologist level but I may not be

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,160
necessarily doing that in all the right

00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:45,049
places right so we want to make sure

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,609
that we're tying architecture work

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:47,930
that's happening to business goals and

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:50,420
that's really the key part about what

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,340
dps does is it brings that strategy lens

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,510
as well as implementation we also work

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,920
closely with our clients to actually

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,390
learn how to do this work right we've

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,370
had a lot of experience in the industry

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,470
doing microservices so we tie that all

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,450
together and you help them understand

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,730
how to do that do they have the skills

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,849
do they have the right people do are

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,220
they prepared to make this transition or

00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:11,930
make this shift in their business it's a

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,090
that's exactly what the the platform

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,709
strategy is looking to address right is

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,000
the technology capabilities that we

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,160
believe are going to be most relevant

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,480
for their digital journey but also what

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,799
are the current state of people

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,389
capability on the ground what's the

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,859
current state of the architecture merge

00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,120
that together with our knowledge

00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:27,799
framework that we've built up over the

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,750
years with our clients and then we find

00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,359
the best stuff the best possible path

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,129
for them prioritizing physicals so when

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,950
you think about the kinds of people that

00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:38,599
work on your team are they jack of all

00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,449
trades do they know everything about

00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,190
technology or do you have focused people

00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:44,540
in different areas yeah I wish that was

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,180
possible these days jack about

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,799
technology is so complicated on that on

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,690
our core team we do have subject matter

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,980
experts that cover different areas as I

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,209
said this is both about service

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,310
architecture as well as infrastructure

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:56,690
so we have different SMEs to cover

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,669
things like container and past strategy

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,230
people that cover sort of domain driven

00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:02,299
design and how that relates to

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,949
architecture and API design and those

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,510
people come together at a client and so

00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:07,340
that's one of the values that we also

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,599
bring is then we bring our normal

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,069
consultants to the ground as well to

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,449
help with implementation but we have

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:12,829
this this sort of constellation of

00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:15,139
experts around them so a true

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:18,109
collaboration on around routine yeah and

00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,940
so what what do you think your your

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:21,380
customers and your partner's find the

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,859
most interesting about working with you

00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,719
on

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,069
GPS yeah I think a lot of the customers

00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:27,169
that we're talking to a really

00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:28,490
struggling with there's so much

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,199
happening in technology what are the

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,400
things we should be doing first and how

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,500
do we know that we're doing it well a

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,210
lot of people as I said are doing

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,460
microservices a lot of them are trying

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,870
to do DevOps or containerisation the

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,129
question is are you getting the lift you

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,110
should be you're always going to get

00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,789
some lift but because we have that 360

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,409
view on various industries and various

00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,909
customers we can kind of help people

00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:48,169
avoid the potholes that others are

00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:50,120
falling in we can help them actually

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:52,069
move as fast as possible in those spaces

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,330
rather than having the bang into the

00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:55,699
learning curve and so you actually

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,550
demonstrate some sort of ROI for them I

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,129
mean if you're really helping them shift

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:03,889
their business their organization into

00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:06,500
being a more modern software delivery

00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,520
architecture is there a return on their

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,960
investment that you can actually

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,580
demonstrate for them it's a great

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,870
question i mean you know strategy is

00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,370
kind of hallucination if it doesn't have

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,169
some metrics at the bottom of it right

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,969
and so we are working hard to figure

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,560
that out and not show how to demonstrate

00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:20,810
it leading indicators are fairly easy

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,710
when you look at sort of api consumption

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,150
when you look at the speed that

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,770
developers have when they're able to

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,810
create new experiences based on wealth

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,669
factored business capabilities those can

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,680
be kind of leading indicators that the

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,349
architecture is supporting the business

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,610
needs the longer-term roi bottom line

00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,199
serves is the business actually

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,490
performing better a piece of that's out

00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,839
of our control but you've got your

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,440
business strategy is not what we're

00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,759
addressing we're addressing

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,289
architectural strategy but we definitely

00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,639
use a number of metrics to try to show

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:47,810
is speed increasing in how much so

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,430
interesting you know with we're hearing

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,400
so much about AI and machine learning

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,469
and everyone wants to think about that

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,360
is part of their transformation that

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:58,400
they'll have machines doing all of the

00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,870
work that people are doing are you seen

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,330
that in what you guys are doing in your

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,129
consulting work yeah we talked a lot

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,139
about having to create a platform as a

00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,339
foundation is very important when you're

00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,289
thinking about things like ml nai

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,789
because how those become business

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:13,189
capabilities right what we don't want is

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,839
again the the boondoggle of we're doing

00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:16,039
some ml right we're crunching lots of

00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:17,719
data well what are you getting out of

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,069
medicine right right so we find that was

00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:21,169
data it's still important to segment by

00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,580
business capability area and then create

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,770
api's on top of that so you eventually

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,830
want digitus developers that are close

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,509
to the customer being able to access

00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,040
capabilities that are powered by ml so

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,390
ml isn't the primary actor if you

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,160
I mean from the businesses point of view

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,510
MLS powering business capability and

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,090
that's where good architecture hides net

00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,130
so are your customers hearing from their

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,830
customers that AI and machine learning

00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:46,430
is important or is that are we at the

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,190
kind of conceptual point of time and the

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,050
hype cycle are we still figuring out

00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,150
what uses are really going to happen I

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,160
certainly have not heard the customers

00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,750
looking directly for AI AM L powered

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,190
solutions they're looking for solutions

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,230
to their problems whether or not be you

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,090
know life problems business problems so

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,800
I think at this point I'm seeing if that

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,030
is that the practitioners are realizing

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,020
that we have a lot of opportunities to

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,850
serve our customers with those

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,410
technologies but not so much seeing our

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,050
customers ask for but I don't see all of

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,550
our customers so if you had one what is

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,920
the biggest challenge that you see or

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,660
your partner's your customers when

00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,820
they're trying to migrate towards a

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,230
digital platform strategy what is the

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,360
biggest thing that they struggle with

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:24,800
and we will we work with typically large

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,480
organizations that have a lot of

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,310
technical legacy and technical debt and

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,540
so the two big things that I would say

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,700
that they struggle it if I have to say

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,020
only one it's going to be actually just

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,610
the complexity of the architectures that

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,990
they've built up over the years as they

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,550
were creating sort of point solutions

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,440
and how those things don't come together

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,850
as a cohesive architecture but if there

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,340
is a second one that I do throw in there

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,020
its capability keeps doing this is very

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,490
complicated a lot of their people are

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,780
very well steeped in their domain and

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,920
they know their business but it's very

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,080
hard to keep up with all the technology

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,000
evolution so we're hoping that we can be

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,500
a lot of that to them excellent so Ryan

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,120
if you and I sit down 12 months from now

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,010
and have the same conversation here next

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,830
year what would you like to say has

00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,660
changed for your group the DPS that

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,210
thought works and what would you like to

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,950
see change in the industry so

00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,360
fascinating question i mean i would like

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,950
to i think that a year from now we're

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,690
going to still see us doing a lot of the

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,640
same things because the the real rate of

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,350
change of complex architectures is you

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,000
know it's not lightning fast italic

00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,010
front-end developer so i think that i

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,480
would like to see us having a lot of

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,340
successes that we can talk about we've

00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,780
had some already and be great to see in

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,310
just the industry recognizing more the

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,830
importance of evolutionary architecture

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,880
as a key key technology strategy I'd

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,650
like to hear people talking more about

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,599
technology strategy really aligned to

00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,099
business strategy those things would be

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,540
great what was the second question if

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,370
the second one is what would you like to

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,290
see the industry doing differently and I

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,719
think at the industry level I think I'd

00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,550
love to see us synthesizing better

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,589
this's and technologies with business

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,379
goals and I want to throw one more

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,579
question in there do you see in all your

00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:51,459
work because I mean I think it's

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:53,509
fascinated with what you guys do

00:08:51,459 --> 00:08:56,839
consulting with all different companies

00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:59,420
do you see any industries that are

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:01,519
moving quicker towards a digital

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,540
platform strategy than other industries

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,069
are there like leaders versus laggards

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,569
you know I haven't done a lot about that

00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:10,579
but when I think about the customers

00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:12,500
that I work with the retail industries

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,529
where people are touching the customer

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,600
in ways that are obviously have advanced

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:19,579
digital leaders driving like the Amazons

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
are under a lot of pressure so I we see

00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:22,579
a lot of them thinking very concretely

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,110
about how to delight their customers

00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,250
with digital experiences they understand

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,740
customers expectations are changing

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,569
other the other industries you know

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,430
maybe Airlines there's but again in

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,170
every industry I've seen even if that

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,399
industry as a whole is that perhaps as

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,810
far along and thinking about the

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,279
customer there are always leaders we

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,810
know we work with Airlines that are very

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,980
innovative in their thinking so I think

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,750
what we're seeing more and more is it's

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,279
not industry-wide but it's specific

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,259
organizations with courageous leaders

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,670
that are driving the change excellent

00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:49,149
Ryan we look for that conversation next

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,149
year thanks I think

00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,210
