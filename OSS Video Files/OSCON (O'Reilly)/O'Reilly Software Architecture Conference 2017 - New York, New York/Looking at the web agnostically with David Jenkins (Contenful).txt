hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,259
software architecture conference in New

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,390
York City i'm here with dave jenkins

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,050
take how you doing you thank you how are

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,450
you good so you with content folder and

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,969
my content or in my content which would

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,789
Gemma well ultimately you should be

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,529
content I mean your users your customers

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,590
should be contented I think that's the

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,029
core of what content what does it

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:27,720
enables organizations to set up a

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,099
content infrastructure to build you know

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,199
whatever it is they want to build on top

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:34,530
of it so what that really means is

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,110
content is stored more in an agnostic

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,700
format so rather than a traditional way

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,430
of looking at content you know students

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,680
web pages HTML in having these kind of

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,640
clunky wrappers around things contempo

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,860
enables you to look more letter that's a

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,420
more agnostic way looking at the web so

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,370
you're not just looking at web pages

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,620
interacting through any kind of device

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,870
that we have now or something a month up

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,510
in the future so with storing content is

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,640
Jason as binary assets and really

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,210
allowing developers to take this out for

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,760
an API and build whatever they want so

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,500
it's a plant and in would you say media

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,000
companies are the ones that would want

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,330
to be consuming this or should be is

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,619
poly media companies so we have a few

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,720
customers who are media companies but

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,320
it's pretty much anyone that has any

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,420
kind of content so it could be banking

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,790
organizations from suitable innovations

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,909
that have a lot of marketing content we

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,850
have some customers who uses for

00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,380
internal training content we have

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,960
finished rail company who is putting

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,390
this in ticket machines so pretty much

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,400
any device any screen that will consume

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,710
content there's something that we can

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,960
work with okay so Wendy let's unpack

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,960
this stack a little bit as like how do

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,939
we how do we interact so if I'm a large

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,790
content producer a media company and I

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:59,759
have tons of video and articles and

00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:04,860
small books and research analysis and

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,880
all this amount of media and content how

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,489
do I engage with you guys

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,050
so I mean it's a bit of a transformation

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,599
let's say a lot of these large

00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,069
organizations are undergoing this

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,840
digital transformation so towards

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,110
microsomes architecture for example is

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,580
something that we have power so when we

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,260
work with a large organization that

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,780
wanted to move a lot of content over

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,239
it's not only let's say the technical

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:32,980
thinking but it's a bit more conceptual

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,930
change so actually do janno Lieber of

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,510
techie consulting at a really good talk

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:40,780
yesterday talking about content or

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,489
really seeing it as as the blood of your

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,519
organization's body pairing everything

00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:47,319
you do so I'd say the first step really

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,480
is an organization has to start thinking

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,390
about content as the basis for

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,489
everything they do second they need to

00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,819
to change this kind of perception of

00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:00,700
thinking about content as a page and as

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,069
an object but more as underlying contact

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,769
so we're talking about changing let's

00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:07,810
say whatever it isn't a champ h or xml

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:10,930
file changing that down to bare bones

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,940
jason that can then be delivered to any

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,970
platform and then third it's really

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,160
rather than delivering you know

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,040
prepackaged content in the format for

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,950
one particular device it's delivering a

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,650
variant api in a structured format and

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:29,500
then using SDKs to to build whatever it

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,730
is you want so it's kind of a different

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,590
way of thinking about things in the

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,630
sense we don't have a presentation layer

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,810
we just deliver the content where an

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,819
endpoint we enable our customers to to

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,170
build any presentation everyone so are

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,690
you kind of led the middleware of

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,290
content I mean it's do I keep the

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,780
content on my site and use your AP is to

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,269
transform it or to deliver it or it's a

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,799
good question so we kind of look at

00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:56,799
content from two perspectives its

00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,340
storage so we actually do the stores or

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,099
SAS platform completely in the clown in

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,989
the US it's also the management of the

00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:07,239
content so we allow editor as well as

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,910
developers to change change things

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,980
update things either very UI or

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,659
programmatically via an API

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,340
set up any kind of structure they want

00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,650
so very flexible content modeling and

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,919
then third key point is delivering it

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,210
scale so the way we look at things is we

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,169
want to take care of all the dirty work

00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,729
in the back so storing servers

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,699
maintaining them looking at the content

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:33,650
delivering it we have a content delivery

00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,229
network as well to deliver the content

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,229
so really all you have to do is focus on

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:41,389
building your app building your website

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,340
building your google glass application

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,570
whatever it is you want to build and you

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,100
know that the content is going to be

00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,900
delivered to that scale and it's going

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,350
to work and in all different formats

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:54,620
like I can my content can be consumed on

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,919
an iPad or absolutely cell phone or a

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,449
computer or absolutely could it go to

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,220
print as well I mean you could go to

00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,169
print yeah we have a few customers who

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,720
do that I mean the advantage of of

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:08,210
storing content at this in this most

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,699
stripped-back format as JavaScript

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,030
object notation is that you can then

00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:16,039
decide in this car like Lego you have

00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,660
your pieces that's structured and you

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,150
can decide am I going to build it into a

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,830
car or a plane or something in the

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,560
future and it's the same if you if you

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,720
structure your content in a way that it

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
can be read by any platform you can then

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,919
decide I'm going to build my website now

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,780
a couple months are building an app

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,889
maybe there's a device that's going to

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,419
come out in a couple of years we don't

00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,310
know maybe something contact lenses and

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,500
cut it out and you'll be able to use

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,120
that same structured content so it

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
allows you to build new applications

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,470
more quickly get things up and running

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,650
more quickly and it's got the future now

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:51,950
do you do the formatting of the content

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,740
or it so if I have a bunch of content

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,740
already how do we get it in that basic

00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,410
form of JSON and how do we get it so

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,450
it's servable to whoever we want right

00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,860
so I mean it depends if you have content

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,900
already that you need to put into the

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,090
system or if you're doing more of a new

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,770
project so there's this two ways of

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,740
really doing it we have everything

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:16,520
stored programmatically as Jason and it

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,770
can be interacted with varun API so we

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,360
have a read API as I've content delivery

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,430
API that sends everything else read only

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,430
but we also have pretty separate

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,570
infrastructure for read and write

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:30,910
he only changes yeah so that means that

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,070
any system that can export data where an

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,290
API in a structured format that can

00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,760
connect look at Temple you might have to

00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,310
build some kind of custom script in the

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,480
middle to transform XML to Jason that

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,570
might have to happen that's something we

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,140
support with but we also have a UI on

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,570
top of this API and one of our customers

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,180
actually referred it to as a adjacent

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,480
editor for non-technical users so it's

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,120
complete kind of graphical you I you can

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,580
have a marketer and editor it types in

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,760
some content in the fields and then it

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,770
saves it as Jason so in some ways it it

00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,990
enables development of marketing teams

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,520
to work together very well enables the

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,610
marketers to put in that content very

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,620
easily developers have it ready and can

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,390
build out whatever is ill to build and

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,580
all their tags and things like that also

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,470
shared it with but can't get that

00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,940
they're putting in you can you can set

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,820
it up any way you want so rather than

00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,230
have let's say prepackaged templates and

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,730
that's something that you might have had

00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:30,700
in the past because if you're only

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,410
delivering two to web pages you have a

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,110
template file is going to look there's a

00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,290
bit more abstract in the sense you can

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,790
set up your own content models and that

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,380
could reflect our webpage it could

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:44,460
reflect something else and you can set

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,140
it up our title field description field

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,570
images you can set up some tags is very

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,180
very custom so you can have hundreds of

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,950
fields in one content type as complex or

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,110
as simple as you want it to be as soon

00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,240
as I've set up marketers not have to put

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,970
the content in when the developers call

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,950
it out they already know the fields how

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,510
they labeled if there are certain tags

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,260
and they know how to use a

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,510
programmatically excellent so David you

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,000
and I sit down 12 months from now and

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,010
have this conversation again next year

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,190
here in New York what would you like to

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,140
say has changed for content phone and

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:24,520
what would you like to say you see the

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:26,830
industry doing with that change um so I

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,050
mean right now we're headquartered in

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,240
Berlin just open an office in San

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,770
Francisco I think from an operational

00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,250
point of view putting an have an office

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,229
here pretty be here again

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,930
we're going to spread a lot more so

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,610
we're growing as an organization and I

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,560
think what we're doing really is trying

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,770
to empower organizations to take this

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,200
leap from from looking at at the web

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,100
from this page centric view to something

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,740
that's a lot more structure than

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,480
holistic I mean people look at content

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,040
on their phones I don't know the last

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,660
time I use my laptop maybe this

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,000
morning's for a couple minutes but I've

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,480
been on my phone you know so we want we

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,510
want to power or water hydration or a

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,640
watch exactly we want to empower

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,320
organizations to deliver content in the

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,180
way that they're using their customers

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,400
are going to interact with it so it's

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,110
it's helping people have a better

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,680
experience so a year from now I think

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,230
we're going to see a lot more

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,870
organizations kind of making this leap a

00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:28,170
lot of talks here have been about this

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,540
transition to Marcus architecture so

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,930
there's a really good talk yesterday on

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,160
architecture resiliency which which I

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,460
really enjoyed because it was talking

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,170
about ways to enable this move from you

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,790
know putting content your own servers

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,470
putting into the cloud there's a lot of

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,000
advantages but there's a lot of

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,350
organizations that are still a bit

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,640
fearful because security I mean downtime

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,760
obviously the obligatory mention of

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,770
Amazon s3 going down yeah I think we're

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,570
going to help organizations feel more

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,150
confident that they can put their

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,440
content in the cloud be sure that it's

00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,960
going to be available it's going to be

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,610
resilient and ultimately they can

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,500
provide a better experience or their

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,810
customers and they can be content and

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,339
they can be content table we will call

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,339
that conversation thank you thank you

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,240
