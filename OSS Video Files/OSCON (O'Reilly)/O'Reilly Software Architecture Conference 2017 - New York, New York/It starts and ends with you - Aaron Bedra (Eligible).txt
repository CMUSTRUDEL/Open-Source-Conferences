	00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,980
there are lots of things to know about

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,809
security the most important thing and

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,670
this ghost of truck modeling is wearing

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,139
much start what do I focus it's just

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,360
like everything else right you gotta

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,920
build a system what are you first right

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,230
threat modeling is just an extension of

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,150
that what what do I focus on when it

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,039
comes to security just like what do I

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,460
focus on when it comes to database

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,720
design or really any peace it is where

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,670
what cloud provider am I going to use

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,260
what what a less am I going to use

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,489
whatever that is right the focus comes

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,920
on priority based on focus and this next

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,110
piece right security should always come

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,820
with purpose and intent so often people

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,010
just paint security on and go oh

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,570
security right because there's a lack of

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,089
understanding of what to do and where to

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,369
focus and we want I want to fix that I

00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:53,190
want to change that well automating

00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:55,379
helps you figure out you know best

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,369
affinity and intent behind the security

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,449
you're adding that's so so important and

00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:02,519
security should be driven by impacts

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,589
either impact to the business to help

00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,170
but go faster and yes that's the thing

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,670
with security i promisee or impact to

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,450
the business in a way if you don't want

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,830
to end up on the front page of

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,140
TechCrunch because you know you're the

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,790
next breach and in the sense of system

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,850
design good security is

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,340
indistinguishable from good design it's

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,340
full stop it is it's just good design

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,580
good design however it is always about

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,140
compromises we make trade-offs that's

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,090
how we make systems work we have this

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,200
wonderful idea in our head and then it

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,850
all comes crashing down we try to

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,290
actually make it work there's somebody

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,390
slide slide systems requirement we never

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,610
thought would happen and that's okay

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,280
right that's just day-to-day life

00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:50,190
security is exactly the same it really

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,409
is the same game and part of the balance

00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,479
is figuring out where do we apply the

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,120
controls how do we apply them why would

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
we apply them and really at the end

00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,810
what's the most important again it's all

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,460
back down to this focus thing we can't

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,170
possibly do it all we can't know it all

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,039
we can't understand at all we will not

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,490
ever get their security is never a black

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,990
and white thing it's not secure insecure

00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,420
never will happen right security is a

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,230
constant state of risk tolerance you

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,879
know how

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,200
how much can I tolerate here here's

00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,319
something bad happens that's really what

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,209
after threat modeling is the vehicle

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,920
that gets us there it's that thought

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:30,110
experiment if that exercise that gets us

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,110
to what's next most important thing

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,980
