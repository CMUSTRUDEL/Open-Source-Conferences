hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,740
software architecture conference in New

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,000
York City i'm here with steve boo Steve

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,529
Steve how you doing good Mike how you

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
doing I'm doing well so you're with red

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,630
hat get in there for a while and blow

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,269
the Red Hat yeah and you work on the

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,730
what the cloud group yeah I'm in the

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,140
cloud bu but my main focus is on

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,029
openshift and so open shift is red hats

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,740
distribution of Cooper Nettie's and so

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,960
sometimes when people i say distribution

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,460
they think oh you just take the bits and

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,679
give them straight to me and it's not

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,059
like that it's much more like what red

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,190
hat does with linux so it's basically

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,230
the same business model so what is what

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,969
is that relationship between open shift

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,329
and COO Burnett uses its not one in the

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,829
same no so it's this if I can explain it

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,239
as a metaphor I think it so that a lot

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,190
of people will get it and then I'll give

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,660
some details around it so when we ship

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,399
Red Hat Enterprise Linux we don't just

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,590
give you a colonel and say hey here's a

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,989
current will have fun right so we take

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,070
the colonel and we help maintain it and

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,989
do all that stuff with it but we don't

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,730
own it but we take the colonel and then

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,070
we put a bunch of stuff around it you

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,199
know like no x windows and all sorts of

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,610
other utilities and post pics and we

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,470
make it into a distribution so that's

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,640
actually usable for your company so that

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,619
you can do stuff with it then we give

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
you support all that stuff so we're

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,590
doing the same thing with Cooper netting

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,900
thread so we don't own communities open

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,400
source project started by Google but

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,960
we're the number two contributor but

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,979
then we take cooper Nettie's straight

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,720
cooper Nettie's like we're it's not a

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,280
fork same thing with the Linux kernel we

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,930
don't fork the Carl we don't for Cooper

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,030
Nettie's it's straight grooving Eddie's

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,860
and then we put stuff around it to make

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,780
it better for systems administrators and

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,490
developers and just make it an easier to

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,799
install make it more productive like a

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,600
real distribution rather than oh here's

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
communities have fun all right so that's

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,740
our bit we are trying to make everybody

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,299
so how does open shift then make it

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,610
easier for developers to build

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,670
applications and to deploy applications

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,110
so developers what I've seen with a lot

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,820
of developers is they're excited about

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,890
docker containers or containers in

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,780
general but they don't actually want to

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,430
become experts in docker right they're

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,990
like oh that's a cool tech and let me

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,979
ask you this are they excited about it

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,369
and do they know what they're getting

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,450
into I think is this yes well I think

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,680
some of the early people were actually

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,899
really excited about it because those

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,280
early people had actually dug in I think

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,899
some people now are like excited about

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,220
it because you have to be excited about

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,110
it otherwise you seem like you

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,550
what you're talking about but there is

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,650
stuff to be excited about with

00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,620
containers I mean it does make running

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,870
your application and actually getting

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,670
your application onto the server in much

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,200
easier because what it does is rather

00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,640
than just laying down the bit it

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,280
actually lays down the bits and how to

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,380
run it so the your ops person can just

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,030
say docker run or in our case you know

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,860
crew benetti's deploy or open ship

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,570
deploy and it actually runs the

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,820
container and then it's really easy to

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,260
scale and do stuff with and so what we

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,730
do an open ship with that so that

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,180
developers don't have to learn quite as

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,890
much about about docker is for like say

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,080
a Java developer they can just give us a

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,730
palm that XML like a maven build file

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,700
and their source code and we have

00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,560
builder images so you say Oh see you

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,570
know run this source code with this

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,100
builder image and we actually take them

00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,050
put them together build a new docker

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,000
image and then push that into our

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,890
integrated doctor registry so open ship

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,380
has a registry in it and then that

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,910
automatically deploys out so they don't

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,470
even know that they've necessarily

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,180
touched on when you say they the

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,610
developer developer or the system

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,400
administrator either well how are they

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,410
getting along in this new world of like

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,300
trying to orchestrate what each of them

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,950
are doing so that's the nice part to the

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,180
develop in this the scenario I just gave

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,950
the developer really only cared about

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,600
their code right they didn't actually

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,830
have to worry about how is this going to

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,080
get deployed and all that other stuff

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,340
and what the systems administrator can

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,340
do through khoob route through open

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,989
shift is actually set up how things get

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,910
deployed or what's the set like they can

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,920
configure that the developer can too but

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,780
the the administrator can say this is

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,340
the secure docker image I want you to

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,290
use to build it I don't want you using

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,080
some willy-nilly thing off a docker hub

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,760
I actually want you to use this one that

00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,590
I built like I know all the layers I'm

00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,810
maintaining it and the developers like

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,160
great you did all that low-level doctor

00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,260
stuff I build my source code and

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,350
together we're deploying something so

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,970
both groups ops cared about risk that's

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,920
their main thing and developers care

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,350
about speed right like an agility and

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,670
and so what this allows is ops is

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,650
controlling the risk of the container

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,209
and developers are getting exactly what

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,459
they want so they can iterate as fast as

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:16,169
they want and it all happens through

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,940
orchestrating and scheduling with on a

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,820
bunch of and are you guys seeing more of

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,400
the two blended the DevOps person or is

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,350
that is that a nice thing to be striving

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,480
towards so

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,420
with the dev ops what what I've been

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,190
seeing more about DevOps is it fits

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,440
really well with micro services and so

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,150
what I'm seeing more of that is you're

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,650
bringing the ops person into the

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,730
developer team and so they're working

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,260
together but this enables that model but

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,600
part of what a DevOps is all about is

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,250
automation and so part of the benefit of

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,300
having something like open shift is all

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,710
that stuff you would have done like a

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,560
Bluegreen deployment you can automate

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,560
that where there's no humans actually in

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,270
there messing things up giving a URL to

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,560
the application it's automated so you

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,360
don't have to go to your office person

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,640
and say yeah give me access to the DNS

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,380
cables which they'll never do right they

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,540
can set it up so it's controlled and

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,890
repeatable and the developer gets to do

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,260
the things they want to do without

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,150
having to bug people and wait on people

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,610
for to do things for them and spin up a

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,040
vm and please them edit the dns table so

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,660
I see it more as like so this comes from

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,750
my therapist she wasn't said to me clear

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,790
boundaries infinite possibilities and at

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,070
first one she said that I was like what

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,630
but if you think about it a lot of the

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,880
times when there's conflict between dev

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,590
and ops it's because there's this area

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,170
where they both feel they have an

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,540
intersection and neither one is getting

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:42,600
what they want so if what happens with

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,690
something like open shift is debs do Deb

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,340
stuff and ops set up the cluster in a

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,390
way that they're like fine I've given

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,590
you that cluster you can do anything you

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,870
want on that cluster and it's not going

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,760
to affect me so we have very I control

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,870
how the cluster setup you get to do

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,640
everything else you want on that side

00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,440
and for the developers like you just

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,480
give me this image and I don't have to

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,870
bug you anymore so it's a draw this

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,320
really clear meeting place where

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,480
responsibility to get much easier

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,580
separator so it's a clear meeting space

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,440
now but are when we introduce serverless

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,480
and when we're running functions and

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,210
containers and all that to get is I

00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,190
still going to be that that Susie yeah

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,230
so here's so server services this new

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,300
trend right and I think it's an

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,550
interesting it's big these is a trend or

00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,530
is it detected any technology is that

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,810
what any recycled from 40 years ago or

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:31,860
20 years ago or I'm trying to think I

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,350
mean or we always want it to go this way

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,360
I don't so here's what let me define

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,500
what I think services further so server

00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,990
listed me as well if you look at

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,210
something like I'm

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,550
on lambda what it is if somebody is

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,800
running a server off somewhere and I sub

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,080
submit code to it and then it spits back

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,940
its result to me and so I've never I've

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,200
never set up a server I'm not doing

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,780
anything I'm just setting coding getting

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,700
it back right and so that works for

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,040
Amazon because it fits into their whole

00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,530
model which is we're going to run

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,930
everything for you and you just use us

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,250
so when people talk about like service

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,350
inside their company or something like

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,360
that if you want to adopt service

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,530
without being tied into Amazon you're

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,270
going to need someone's going to need to

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,400
install something server list somewhere

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,360
so I think the server list abstraction

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,770
is actually a concept that it circles

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,930
its service from the viewpoint of the

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,360
developer so you can't say like

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,910
containers can do serverless containers

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,770
can't really do service on their own but

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,810
they can to a developer so somebody has

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,250
to write something in containers then

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,530
probably put it inside of cooper

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,140
Nettie's or open shift and then to the

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,120
developer it ends up looking like oh

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,980
it's server list but someone still have

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,720
to run a server somewhere with the code

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,760
in it so you can bring it inside your

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,470
company until the developers we're going

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,000
to give you server list it's just not

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,290
running in Amazon that's running here

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,660
but somebody's got to write code to

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,400
accept the server list stuff and to run

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,020
and still have to run those servers and

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,640
would that give someone like serverless

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,470
cooper daddy's inside the organization

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,300
yeah so I think basically so they're

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,910
still have to be system in who set up

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,910
the open shift or criminality structure

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,800
and then they'll have to be somebody who

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,990
writes the code that accepts the server

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,370
list stuff but to the rest of the devel

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,510
so there'll be a group of developers who

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,730
are maintaining the service

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,830
infrastructure and ops people but to the

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,630
rest of the developer organization it's

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,000
as if they were talking to lambda right

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,060
or some other server list server list a

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,730
situation so it teeny service is an

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,990
interesting abstraction and you can have

00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,660
it anywhere it just depends its

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,450
serverless to whom right you can't just

00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,670
there's still people at Amazon write the

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,230
function right to the code that runs

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,450
Lance so someone someone built the

00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:40,150
infrastructure that the dump is running

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,220
on exactly so service is kind of a its

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,960
service to the developer it's not like

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,640
there's no server anywhere you always

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,320
have to have servers running it at least

00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,180
this way at this age in computing

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,980
there's probably something a machine

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,410
running somewhere that's running some

00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,610
ode whether the real question is what

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,680
does it look like to the developer so

00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,750
containers and open shift can actually

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,220
make that easier right to actually set

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,690
that up inside your organization but you

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,240
still are going to need a server and

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,050
something to accept it to have server

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,510
list okay so if you were to sit down and

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,630
again we'll sit down maybe in London or

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,149
here next year okay what would you say

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,329
you'd like to see happen in this space

00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:21,040
in 12 months and what would you like to

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:24,570
see red hat doing differently in 12

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,060
months okay in the same space right so

00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,800
what I would like to see in 12 months so

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,899
I've already seen these changes as well

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,339
so actually it's nothing that I want to

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,949
be different like so I've talked to

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,510
software architecture a couple times and

00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:40,449
you when I first gave some of these

00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,510
talks about open shift when we move to

00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:44,380
the communities in the container model I

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,000
said how many people here know docker

00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:48,010
containers and like a few hands went up

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,470
and I was like how many no good bernetti

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,660
and no hands went up this year when I

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,579
gave that talk almost everybody had

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,829
known containers and docker containers

00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,480
are ready and maybe a quarter of the

00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,370
room had known crew benetti's and what

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
it does and that was used Kuber Nettie's

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,569
or do people about it look okay look

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,980
okay so I'm just trying to see like how

00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,500
much do I have to educate the audience

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,670
on what we're doing here and so what I'd

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,000
like to see is a continuation of that

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,250
trend where people I think can be

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,980
relevant in development and to be

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,240
relevant in operations you actually do

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,740
need to know about containers know like

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,480
some people I think probably were

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,010
waiting like oh this is the latest fad

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,350
right this is like what happened with

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,300
rails ruby-on-rails which was a really

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,740
great paradigm shift but I've seen that

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,019
kind of just drop off it's not as

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,029
popular as it once was I think

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,370
containers they've been here for a long

00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:38,709
time but this new push to containers is

00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,579
actually here to stay and once you start

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:42,220
running containers you need to

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,899
orchestrate and schedule them so for me

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,040
I think open ship and crew pernetti's is

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,660
the best way to do that you could also

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,000
be looking at dr. swarm or mesosphere

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,920
right those are others orchestration and

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,329
scheduling frameworks but more of this

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,889
awareness among developers and offs

00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:59,019
people about this new way of horizontal

00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,570
scaling a lot more about this new cloud

00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,960
building things for cloud

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:06,120
which is a typical look at any time what

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,110
red hat should be doing differently

00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,990
absolutely nothing we're perfect in

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,840
every single way what I'd like us to be

00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,420
doing differently is keep developing our

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,250
to keep iterating and improving our

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,620
developer experience so that it becomes

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,320
even easier for developers to do their

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,660
daily work on openshift that's right and

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,580
I actually mean Red Hat really is it all

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,770
in on containers and when I was making

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,540
that analogy about Corinne Eddie's and

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,280
linux kernel that wasn't just because

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,500
it's a good analogy I mean that is how

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,840
red hat is now so when people come up

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,520
and say how big the open shift team I

00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,590
say well it's kind of hard to say

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,060
because yeah we've got the people who

00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:44,080
contribute directly to Cooper Nettie's

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,300
and then we got people who build the

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,010
open shift interfaces but like all the

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,390
way down to the rel people that we used

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,920
to just be rel they're building stuff

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,090
around containers they're building stuff

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,610
that makes it better in Cooper Nettie's

00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,890
so it's there's been a real shift in red

00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,210
hat like this is where the puck is kind

00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,700
of moving and we're going there with it

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,380
when we think it but what the reason the

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,810
puck is going there is because a lot of

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,420
our customers are saying this makes our

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,610
life better and we want more of this so

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,250
excellent so last question for you yeah

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,350
gillyweed ice cream and if you do what's

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,900
your favorite flavors so okay I'm glad

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,190
you asked that question so I have an

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,440
opinion about ice cream I like mint

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,210
chocolate chip as my go-to right and

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,440
that's what so if I go just to any

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,310
random ice cream place i'm probably

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,740
going to go with mint chocolate chip

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,670
it's minty and fresh but it's got cream

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,440
and then it's a little bit of chocolate

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,840
like what can go basically go wrong I

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,030
prefer when it's not green because as

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:36,010
usually just died so I prefer not to

00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,840
have the dye just but I'll go with it

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,600
anyway but then if I go to a good ice

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,800
cream place then it's like game on so

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,350
like there's this place in Santa Cruz

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,570
Roylin called Mary Ann and they have

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,240
like mexican chocolate and on a horchata

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,620
flavor who so basically i make up when i

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,450
do that i get those together I'm like oh

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,700
I'm in Mexico with my ice cream and it's

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,710
like this really nice cinnamony and

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,450
young but then they also have this

00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,950
really good dark chocolate flavor I

00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,720
forget the name of it but they have like

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,210
an Oregon blackberry so you put

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,370
chocolates in Black Creek so I have a

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,900
favorite flavor that I go to is my

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,730
standard but there's lots that I know

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,070
and will you travel around the world you

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,660
go to ice cream shops to find out what

00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,590
they do so sometimes i do is where i

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,240
went to like

00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,860
when I was in Israel in Bear Sheva

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,540
there's a famous ice cream place there

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,670
called litobear Sheva so I would go

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,070
there and try that mmm when I was in

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,280
Italy I actually had real gelato in

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,870
Italy and then I discovered that all the

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,030
people who call themselves gelato places

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,920
in the United States are lying right

00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:37,930
like when I had that gelato it was like

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,040
what is this magic oh my gosh but you

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,420
know what because recently I think

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,520
happened to me I think I'm starting to

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,990
get lactose intolerant mm-hmm so I'm

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,120
gonna have to start my new de area of

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,010
discovery will have to be in lactose

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,230
free ice creams like the way screams or

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,700
something I am yeah duck Celyn see we

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,170
