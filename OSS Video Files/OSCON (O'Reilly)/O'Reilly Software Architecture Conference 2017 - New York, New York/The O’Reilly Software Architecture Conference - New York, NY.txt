in the beginning we had Monell if we had

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,360
databases we have very low expectations

00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:12,570
but that world simply doesn't exist

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,660
anymore it is time to wake up it's time

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,369
to retire the model is and decompose our

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,189
systems in the management discreet

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,220
services that can be scaled individually

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,220
that can be operated rolled out and

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,840
failed in isolation that's what's taking

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,899
down the horses so when we use terms

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,300
like Devon agile development cloud

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:38,250
natives micra services we're actually

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,809
all kind of circling around the same

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,850
fundamental shift in the way that

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,670
software is introduced in the industry

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,950
we're trying to address those at little

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,809
new beginning architect but also

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,149
experienced architects as well were in

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,989
June high performance computing

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:53,579
individual architectures we love

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,680
happening really on the cutting edge of

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,690
that world but individual microservices

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,600
are fairly easy to juggle standings

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,059
implement what it's hard especially all

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,040
the things around you know things like

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,240
discovery coordination security

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,409
replication data consistency failover

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,020
deployment integration with other

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,240
systems legacy systems etc you'll find

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,330
that we look at cell architecture from a

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,490
lot of the brain from DevOps security

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,050
written decision making skills and we

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,970
also get into some really technical

00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,040
softly microservices and reactive

00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,420
architecture so if you need to know

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
about software architecture you should

00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,960
