	00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:08,910
so let's turn to a pattern language and

00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:13,410
revisit the original conception of

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:15,450
patterns so Alexander and his colleagues

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,029
described patterns as this three-part

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:23,250
rule expressing a relation between a

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:26,850
context a problem and a solution very

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,670
simple the context representing the

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:36,110
situation in which a particular

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:39,090
architectural problem occurs the problem

00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:41,309
which they describe as an unbalanced

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,890
system of forces that occur repeatedly

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,629
in that context and we can think of

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,940
these forces as independent vectors

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,260
having direction and magnitude and I'm

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,719
immediately taken back to high school

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,370
physics and we have this problem where

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,469
we have a system of forces we have to

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,120
find the magnitude of the missing force

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,980
and every time my teacher would work one

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,840
of those problems he would repeat the

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,600
same phrase the sum of the forces has to

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,290
equal zero and that turns out to be our

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,049
goal in the pattern is that we want to

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,479
apply a solution that brings the forces

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,060
back into balance we want the sum of the

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,240
problem and the solution to equal zero

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,369
and so the solution ends up being

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,750
represented by a pattern which brings

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,750
the context back into balance

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,270
