	00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:07,410
the customer wants to buy a piece of

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,030
furniture but that piece of furniture is

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,160
a little dinged up it's got some damage

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,260
so they would like the price adjusted

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,790
downward to reflect that the cashiers

00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,170
cool with that cashier wants to sell the

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,330
piece of furniture no problem

00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,009
but the cashier is interacting with the

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:27,089
point of sale software that my team

00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:29,609
wrote so and not just that but this

00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,710
software that my team wrote is taking

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,510
our orders from retail administration

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,730
and they have a different idea about

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,270
those price adjustments they care about

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,340
safety and safety here is you've got it

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,620
like broaden the definition of safety

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,070
it's not just human physical safety

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,840
it means we're averting disasters in a

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,800
business the ultimate disaster is you

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,289
run out of money and you go out of

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,539
business so retail administration is

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,940
trying to protect the company from that

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,399
we're trying to avoid accidents like

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,019
fraud so they're afraid of the cashiers

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,120
making too many price adjustments

00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:05,450
selling furniture super cheap to their

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,280
friends and defrauding the company

00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:11,340
that's what retail administration cares

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,729
about so they implement a safety

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,350
constraint in the software or we

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,540
implement a safety constraint in the

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,079
software that makes price adjustments

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,829
harder

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,210
so maybe retail is like hey they need to

00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,030
type in their password for every price

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,439
adjustment and they need to get a

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,659
manager approval for every price

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,320
adjustment yeah that'll that'll be safe

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:37,020
and there's this little safety control

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,700
loop built into the software now to keep

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,170
a safety control loop in place you have

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,759
to consider more than just this

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,079
socio-technical system you have to

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,390
consider the system that builds the

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,450
system and these constraints are imposed

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,130
on my developer system by management my

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,640
management telling me to do what retail

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,399
administration says however as a

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,659
developer I've been to the store you

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,859
know we've we've rolled out the first

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,899
version of the software we go to the

00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,270
store we see how it's doing we observe

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,700
that cashiers are just taking forever to

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:08,759
enter the same 10% price adjustment for

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,649
these 12 items and we're like please

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,239
first of all we're going to make it so

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,069
they can select all the items and do the

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,890
price adjustment what we're gonna make

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,690
their lives easier that way and

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,480
how about we compromise and they only

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:24,500
have to get a manager approval on price

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,750
adjustments over 10% so we work this out

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,660
and we implement that and then what

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,170
happens is of course almost all price

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:36,430
adjustments are exactly 10%

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,430
software influences behavior

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,030
