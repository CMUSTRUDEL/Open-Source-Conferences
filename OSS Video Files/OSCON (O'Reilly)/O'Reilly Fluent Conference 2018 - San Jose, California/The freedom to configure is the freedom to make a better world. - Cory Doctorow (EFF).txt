Publication date: 2018-06-14
Playlist: O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2018 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Chances are you fell in love with technology the day you took some tool that didn't quite work for you and made it betterâ€”better suited to you and your idiosyncratic needs and uses. Then you shared your improvements and made other people's lives better too, and what sweeter feeling is there? Cory Doctorow explains why the right to configure is the signature right of the 21st century.

	00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,690
now our world is increasingly

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,519
computerized this building this building

00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,890
is a computer that we put nerds inside

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,050
of a pacemaker is a computer that we put

00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,180
inside of our bodies a voting machine is

00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:19,449
a computer that we put democracies into

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:22,260
and a 747 is a flying Solaris box in a

00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:25,570
very fancy very expensive aluminum case

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,760
the only way we contain secure and

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,070
perfect these computers as if we can

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,480
configure them and so in the 21st

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,710
century you'd hope that configuration

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,820
would becoming more readily available

00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:39,579
but instead we're taking it away back in

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,710
1998 Congress enacted the Digital

00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,630
Millennium Copyright Act DMCA it's a big

00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,460
gnarly hairball of copyright law but one

00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,059
section of it has been particularly

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,040
salient in this moment section 1201 the

00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:53,559
anti-circumvention element of the DMCA

00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,649
makes it a felony punishable by a

00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:59,110
five-year prison sentence to bypass an

00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:03,760
access control for a copyrighted work to

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:06,279
get rid of some drm now once this was

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,200
used to stop competitors and hobbyists

00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:10,810
for making DVD players that could play D

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,049
regionalised discs or modding sega

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:16,060
dreamcast to play homebrew games and and

00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:17,829
therefore make sure that sega always got

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,380
a cut because you had to use their CD

00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:22,959
presses to press a Dreamcast game but

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,759
now this law it affects everything that

00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,529
has a copyrighted work in it and since

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,509
software is a copyrighted work and since

00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:30,609
software is and everything this law

00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:33,429
increasingly affects everything

00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:35,319
and that's why DRM is now phone found in

00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:37,929
voting machines and cars and tractors

00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:40,209
and toys and pacemakers and artificial

00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:43,749
pancreas and baby monitors and drones

00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:46,569
and phones because once a vendor deploys

00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:48,939
the minimum viable DRM a one molecule

00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:51,310
thick layer of DRM that can be color

00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,469
ibly claimed to do something to stop

00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:56,380
people from accessing a copyrighted work

00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:58,389
then they get to invoke DMCA 1201 and

00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,849
that gives them the power to sue anyone

00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:03,249
who bypasses the DRM for any reason to

00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:05,829
make a compatible product to do security

00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:08,140
research to reveal a defect in a product

00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:09,670
that the person who's using the product

00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,620
might want to know about because once

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,239
you know about software defects and DRM

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,190
you know where to start probing to

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,420
dismantle that DRM

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,790
and so what has happened is that firms

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,830
have gotten the ability to convert their

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,270
commercial preferences about who can

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,850
criticize and interoperate with their

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,470
products into legally enforceable rights

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,250
and that's why I DRM is proliferating

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,350
anywhere

00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:35,470
the latest iPhones if you take the

00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,000
screen out of an iPhone that is busted

00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,640
say it's got a broken circuit board and

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,590
you put it on to the body of an iPhone

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,810
that's got a broken screen it won't run

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,010
anymore you have to get permission from

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,530
Apple in the form of an authorization

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,810
code and by passing that permission to

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,240
use an Apple screen on an Apple phone

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,100
without apples permission bypassing that

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,510
authentication step is a felony

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,180
punishable by a five year prison

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,830
sentence John Deere is put DRM in its

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,380
tractors so that if you're a farmer and

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,780
your tractor breaks down and you swap a

00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,480
new part into it it won't work until you

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,520
pay up to $200 and wait one to three

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,980
days for some Rando to show up at your

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,250
farm and enter an authentication code

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,750
into your dashboard every time you turn

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,700
on the key you have to click through

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,239
EULA saying that you agree to these

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,930
terms

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,800
eli lilly has just launched an insulin

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,420
pump that takes proprietary insulin and

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,520
bypassing that lock as a felony we're

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,970
turning people with diabetes into inkjet

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,970
