Publication date: 2018-06-14
Playlist: O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2018 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	Maggie Pint explains how bad date support in JavaScript took one frontend developer (her) from making HR software in Minneapolis to working as an Azure SRE. It's a story of failures and heartbreaks but also of change, success, and the amazing power of the many people in the open source and standards community.

so I went to moment I I looked for an up

00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,410
for grabs work item which is like a

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,309
beginner work item how many people here

00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,370
have done an up for grabs good and I

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,630
picked out this uh set time like set the

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,680
time on a moment object it had been

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,669
marked up for grabs

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,079
and I started working on it and I put

00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:24,540
you know on the issue like hey I've got

00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,430
this I'm gonna try it out and I'm going

00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,610
through the code and I'm like digging

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,470
down into every line of moments internal

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,059
parsing code every single line of it and

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,620
I'm looking at the idea that I would

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,550
pass a time through the parser and set

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,489
on the object and like this will never

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,530
work these code paths don't exist I will

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,030
never give an accurate time to a moment

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,010
object with a set function it will never

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,079
happen but then I was like this has to

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,670
be me right like moment is made by cool

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
people and downloaded by millions so it

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,690
has to be me who doesn't fundamentally

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:59,070
understand the genius of this code right

00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:00,780
but I had said I would do it so I made

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,460
this pull request this is the actual

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,590
poll request and I said hey guys there's

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,899
some problems here I can get this far in

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:14,670
the code but I don't think this is ever

00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:16,890
gonna work and then I shook in fear I

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,149
literally like my hands were shaking I

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,950
remember laying in bed and I was like

00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:21,119
this you could see it like someone who's

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,290
gonna I'm gonna be really embarrassed on

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,869
the internet right now and I'm looking a

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,549
bad developer it's gonna happen and

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,320
while I was shaking in fear of her a

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,729
couple of days I found about 4 more bugs

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,110
and fixed that moment like I was like

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,579
pull request pull request pull requests

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:37,829
well this first one sat and then maybe a

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,840
week later they came back we had a long

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,920
discussion on the PR and they said

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,780
you're right Maggie we can't make this

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,090
modification the cloud will never allow

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,409
for it but those button fixes they were

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,530
great would you mind joining our core

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,240
contributor team no seriously this is

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,920
this is what happened I couldn't fix the

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,920
code so they invited me to the core team

00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,520
lesson community-based open source

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,170
projects are pretty desperate for help

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,000
and I was like heck yeah join your code

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,070
core team that sounds amazing

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,450
I committed code I give talks I

00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,130
collaborated with this huge community of

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,410
wonderful people who like just wanted to

00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,660
make JavaScript better even JavaScript

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,000
dates and like I was a date

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,370
I'm expert and at this point I was like

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,110
how do we fix this in the language how

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,130
do I figure something out to make it so

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,200
that we don't have to carry our own

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,460
giant libraries like moment I know

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,580
everyone was like oh god the giant

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,580
