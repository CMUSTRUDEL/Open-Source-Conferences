can you start off with kind of what's

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,059
happening in the EU yeah it's been kind

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,889
of a mess so you've probably all heard

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,330
about the GDP are that was an exercise

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,520
that mandated that everyone who writes

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,289
emails go away for a workshop on writing

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,460
an email begging you to Reese absque

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,650
Ribe on the day that the GDP are dropped

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,060
the European Union committee that is

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,759
drafting the next copyright directive

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,829
the first update in 17 years they

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,480
introduced language that had formerly

00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:32,610
been ruled out of the copyright

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,500
directive that says that everyone who

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,870
builds a service that allows the public

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,780
to upload a potential copyrighted work

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,790
whether that's tax or still images video

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:47,610
games code sounds you have to build an

00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,710
upload filter that does a kind of black

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,690
box machine learning look up against a

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,760
corpus of known copyrighted works and

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,920
prevents a work from being posted if you

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,410
think it's copyrighted you have to allow

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,390
anyone to bulk upload new copyrighted

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,090
works into the training data for this ML

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,610
system with no penalties for people

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,009
abusing it like I could take all of the

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,229
text ever posted to Wikipedia and dump

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:13,770
it into the machine learning algorithm

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,079
run by say WordPress and lay claim to

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,520
its copyright I would face no penalties

00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,409
and no one could quote Wikipedia on

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,329
WordPress ever again and then in

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,399
addition to that they've created a link

00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,710
tax where anyone who links to a

00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,869
newspaper or any news article has to get

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,579
a license and not just one license

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,780
there'll be 28 different versions of

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:32,880
what part of the link you have to

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,530
license one in each country it means

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,659
that Wikipedia and other projects won't

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,030
be able able to link to the web so any

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,219
of you who are Europeans Savior internet

dot EU is the place to go we have until

00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,179
xx before this committee decides whether

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,369
or not to refer this language up to the

00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,929
European Parliament and it's probably

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,119
