Title: The parallel future of the browser - Lin Clark (Mozilla)
Publication date: 2018-06-14
Playlist: O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2018 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	The browser needs to get faster. Applications are testing the limits of current browsers, especially on devices like smartphones. Lin Clark explains how the browser works today and what browser vendors need to do over the next few years to ensure their browsers (and the web itself) meet upcoming demands.

browsers need to get faster and this is

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,300
because content on the web has changed a

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:10,800
lot since the early days in the early

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,410
days of the web speed really didn't

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,240
matter that much we were just looking at

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,460
static documents so as soon as the

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,860
document was rendered to the screen the

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,320
browser was pretty much done but then

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,400
people started pushing the boundaries

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,800
pages started gaining they're active and

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,600
having animations for example do you

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,400
remember when everyone went wild with

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,759
drop-down menus and created these fancy

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,530
slide down menus with jQuery once that

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,180
was part of the page the web page wasn't

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,559
just being painted once in the browser

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,290
with every change it needed to be

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,059
repainted if you wanted interactions or

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,590
animations to look smooth these repaints

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,899
needed to be happening at a certain rate

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,300
the screen needs to be repainted 60

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,070
times per second summon that you only

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,829
had 16 milliseconds to get all of the

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,180
work done browsers made all sorts of

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:55,860
changes to come up to speed and to

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,140
accommodate these new applications and

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,760
get up to 60 frames per second but has

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,140
this the way with the web content

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,870
authors started pushing the boundaries

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,549
even more porting PC games and talking

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,770
about bringing things like Photoshop to

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,029
the web and it's not just the content

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,619
authors that are pushing these

00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:13,319
boundaries either it's also hardware

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,810
vendors for example the new iPad is

00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,789
going from 60 frames per second to 120

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,079
frames per second and new kinds of

00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:21,359
content are coming to the web and

00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,429
pushing the web even further for example

00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,990
of a virtual reality of one display for

00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:27,659
each eye which is probably displaying at

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,670
4k resolution and these displays have to

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,829
be updated at 90 frames per second to

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,529
avoid motion sickness so let's think

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,240
about what that change means if we're

00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:38,759
running a website on a 13-inch MacBook

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,729
Pro we have 16 milliseconds to fill in

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,499
about 4 million pixels with the next

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,810
iPad you have half as much time 8

00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:48,989
milliseconds to fill in 3 million pixels

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,969
and with a viewer experience you have 11

00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,099
milliseconds to fill in sixteen point

00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,029
five million pixels and this doesn't

00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,979
even include any of the heavier

00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:58,739
JavaScript needs that an application

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,479
like that might have so this is a huge

00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:01,369
leap that browsers need to make in order

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,829
to keep up

00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,939
what happens if browsers don't keep up

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:07,799
well as more and more people buy these

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,840
devices and as more and more content

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,209
moves into these heavy applications if

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,860
browsers don't keep up people will stop

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,030
seeing the web as the default place to

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,570
put their content

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,640
and that is a pretty scary thought but

00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,530
to be honest I'm not too worried I'm

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,070
confident that browsers can make this

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,990
leap

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,520
the reason I'm confident is that at

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,130
Mozilla we've been prepping for this for

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,630
the past 10 years we've been looking at

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,550
the direction that computer hardware is

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,170
going and we've been figuring out the

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:35,570
way that we need to program to keep up

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,180
with these changes

00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:41,760
the answer is parallelism the future of

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,440
the browser is parallel we've only just

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
started taking advantage of this in

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,250
Firefox but we're already seeing big

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,690
wins from it and every indication is

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,620
that this new way of doing things can

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,620
