Publication date: 2018-06-14
Playlist: O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2018 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	What if you could increase your website's SEO, improve your mobile web design, and get a head start on the coming conversational UI revolution through a renewed focus on accessibility? And what if you increased your user base by making it more accessible to disabled users? Scott Davis explains why accessibility should be just as important to you as a mobile design strategy was 10 years ago.

and so that's what I want to talk about

00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:11,469
here today accessibility now if you look

00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:14,230
it up in a dictionary I love this

00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:16,900
definition of accessibility because it

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,920
applies to what we do here web

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,260
development accessibility is the quality

00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,480
of being able to be reached or found

00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,500
it's the quality of being able to be

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,320
easy to use it's the quality of being

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,059
easy to understand these are all things

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,170
that we strive to do as web developers

00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:41,159
right and yet in this definition

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,469
disability doesn't show up anywhere

00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:47,379
fascinating fascinating because if you

00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:48,940
plug web accessibility into your

00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,089
favorite search engine of choice all of

00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:56,739
a sudden disability comes up all over

00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:58,690
the place now disability isn't something

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:02,019
we should ignore I definitely want to

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,890
appeal to the altruistic your core

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,920
humanity to help people out but it's

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:14,290
really interesting that if we tie

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:18,659
disability to accessibility it opens the

00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:21,130
door for all kinds of excuses doesn't it

00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,140
well I want my website to be accessible

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:31,000
of course but oh we don't have the time

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,530
or the funding or the expertise and by

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,119
the way I mean do we really do we really

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:41,049
need it it's interesting did you know

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,719
that 20% of the world has some form of

00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,429
disability if you have a form of

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,659
disability any disability all it makes

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:54,369
you a part a member of the largest

00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:58,090
minority in the world and yet we say

00:01:54,369 --> 00:02:02,140
often it's only 20% right we've got lots

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:06,210
of users lots of customers it's

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,039
interesting because as I talk to clients

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,610
about conversational UI's they say oh

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,250
yes we want Siri we want Alexa we want

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,760
Microsoft Cortana and I say yeah we want

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,980
to

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,730
ability to rightness and now now really

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:25,930
we're just interested in Siri and Alexa

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:28,930
and Cortana it's interesting how we kind

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,760
of compartmentalize this but whether

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,370
we're talking about vibrate on your

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,230
phone or pinching or stretching or these

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,659
conversational you eyes

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,980
well nominally these are accessibility

00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:43,980
features I would argue they're just

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,980
