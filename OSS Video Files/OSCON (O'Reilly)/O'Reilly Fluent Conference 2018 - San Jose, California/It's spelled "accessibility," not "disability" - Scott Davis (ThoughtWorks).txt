Playlist: O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2018 - San Jose, California
Description: 
	What if you could increase your website's SEO, improve your mobile web design, and get a head start on the coming conversational UI revolution through a renewed focus on accessibility? And what if you increased your user base by making it more accessible to disabled users? Scott Davis explains why accessibility should be just as important to you as a mobile design strategy was 10 years ago.
