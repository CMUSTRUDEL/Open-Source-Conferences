Title: OpenAI and the Path toward Safe AGI - Greg Brockman (OpenAI)
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - San Francisco, California
Description: 
	OpenAI has recently demonstrated systems capable of advanced robotic manipulation, holding their own against professionals in the massively complex game Dota 2, as well as unprecedented language understanding. Greg Brockman discusses the increasing generality of these systems and their implication for how we should think about and plan for creating safe AGI.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,640
and so my goal for this talk is to

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,830
communicate to you the evidence that I

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,719
and my organization open AI have been

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,030
gathering over the past couple years in

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,650
order to update us on this question I'm

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,179
not here to say that it's definitely

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,560
gonna happen I'm not here to say that we

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,330
have high certainty because we really

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,330
don't wanna but instead I'm I'm here to

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,400
say that the given the facts that we see

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,260
in front of us right now that it becomes

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,939
really hard to confidently rule out

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,090
general intelligence happening in the

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,439
near term and you know I think AGI is is

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,610
this thing that everyone has a bit of a

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,290
different picture of what it is again is

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,820
this very intuitive thing for many of us

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,500
you know we all are intelligent beings

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
we feel that we have some you know

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,469
understanding of what intelligence is

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,420
but to really define it is another thing

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,750
you know that the definition we use that

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,430
at open AI is highly autonomous systems

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,850
that outperform humans at most

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,440
economically valuable work now there's

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,180
four areas of evidence that I want to go

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,440
into the first of these is lessons from

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,969
history of science you know it's very

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,770
tempting just to say let's just go to

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,570
the experts and whatever the experts say

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,910
that we should listen to that with 100%

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,589
confidence but history of science has

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,240
other things to say and it's interesting

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,760
to look at some of the predictive

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,799
failures and to hear some echos of the

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,570
kinds of arguments people have made in

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,060
in terms of what we hear in today's

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,979
general intelligence conversation so in

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,150
1901 you have Simon Newcomb who thought

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,430
they'd be proven that heavier-than-air

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,840
flight was totally impossible I you know

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,979
in 1908 he heard about the Wright

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,570
brothers plate he said all right it's

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,650
possible but never going to be

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,820
commercially important because there's

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,689
no way you're ever going to be able to

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,189
scale to both a passenger and a pilot

00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,780
after World War two you had both the

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,790
Americans and Russians looking at German

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,290
v2 technology they both wanted to do the

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,189
same thing they wanted to build ICBMs

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,170
which meant they were gonna have to

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:42,810
build a 200-ton rocket that meant

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,890
scaling up the v2 by 10x the Americans

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,869
looked at that they're like no way

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,630
totally abandon long-range rockets for

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,250
the next half decade the Russians said

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,710
all right guess we're gonna build a

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,360
giant rocket fortunately no one ever use

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,649
this stuff for military purposes but

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,210
when the space race came along the

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,829
Russians said well we do have this giant

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,799
rocket and that's how they got to space

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,570
first I you know you also have people

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,479
like like woolly who was a very

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,179
well-respected astronomer in the UK and

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,890
1936 he wrote a scathing review of a

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,629
rocketry book saying this stuff is all

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,980
bogus even though they make this appeal

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,890
saying that well if people thought

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,239
light was bogus this is really bogus 20

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,519
years later same tune saying

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,110
spaceflights utter bilge and then you

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,290
know one year later you have Sputnik one

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,290
launch

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,560
