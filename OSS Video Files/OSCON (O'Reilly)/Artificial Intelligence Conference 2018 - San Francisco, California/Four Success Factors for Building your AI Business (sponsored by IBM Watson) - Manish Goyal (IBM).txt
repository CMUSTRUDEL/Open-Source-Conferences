	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,879
morning but as I mentioned my name is

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:11,070
Manish girl I lead the a I practice at

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,300
IBM services and as part of IBM services

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,630
we've had opportunity to work with

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,940
hundreds of customers helping them apply

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,580
AI to variety of use cases across

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,460
industries now earlier this year we

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,519
interviewed about 5,000 c-suite

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,590
executives for an AI study to understand

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,579
you know where they're making their

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,309
investments in AI what options is seeing

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,680
what barriers is seeing in adopting AI

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,520
at scale in the enterprise and that's

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,809
really the focus of my talk of how how

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,789
we can help

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:51,210
ai enterprises scale AI so let's start

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:53,430
with looking at the stay of AI adoption

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,320
in the enterprise I know there have been

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,469
a bunch of surveys that have been shown

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,719
in terms of the adoption of AI in the

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,699
enterprise the top-line message here is

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,049
no different right majority of the

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,760
enterprises that were surveyed

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,490
interviewed said that they are either

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,740
adopting or implementing AI right

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,549
so executives across these industries

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,830
are looking at ways of scaling AI

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,450
throughout their companies to go after

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,920
the billions of dollars of opportunity

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:26,220
that is available you know as that AI

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,770
unlocks now as they are going after this

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,990
opportunity they're stumbling against

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,250
what you know we refer to as the AI

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,220
paradox it's it's deceptively easy to

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,780
get started with AI pilots right

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,570
launching air pilots and getting great

00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,490
results but it's extremely hard to move

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,729
from those pilots to production

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,020
deployments at scale and this is what

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,390
you see on the right-hand side of this

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,259
chart right if you look at the number of

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,170
or the percentage of customers or

00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,990
participants who are in the later stages

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,939
of their AI journey right whether they

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,060
are implementing operating or optimizing

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,879
AI systems it's it's a stark difference

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,129
between the out performers versus the

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,790
rest and Mia the out performers are

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:16,849
basically in the 5000 company that

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,849
surveyed you know companies that

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:22,129
outperformed their peer group across you

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,329
know revenue growth and profitability so

00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:26,090
there's a there's a big difference

00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:27,560
between people who are able to you a

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,970
companies who are enterprises were able

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:35,720
to move to getting to two little phases

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,299
of their AI journey so what we wanted to

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,849
do was you know look at what are these

00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,750
out performers doing that is different

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:46,579
from the rest being able to move forward

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,629
so let's start by looking at you know

00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,720
where they're making their AI

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:53,299
investments right across the board

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,780
you know executives are focusing on

00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:59,060
customer retention customer satisfaction

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,340
as the primary objective of their AI

00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,430
investments right and they're doing this

00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,540
significantly over going after

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,329
operational cost reduction now this

00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,340
makes sense right companies have for

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:16,430
decades stored a lot of information

00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,900
about their customers right and they

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,400
have a lot of information about the

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,760
customer interaction that they have been

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,919
capturing but so far it was very hard to

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,349
actually use that information right

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,540
whether it be you know survey results

00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:32,930
you know feedback on online on in forums

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,329
or in social media or you know photos of

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:39,109
our images of products and services in

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:41,780
use right or contact center recordings

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,620
of interactions between customers and

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,930
customer service representatives now all

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,299
of that data has a tremendous amount of

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,949
opportunity to understand what customers

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,569
like or don't like about your products

00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:57,650
services or their customer experience

00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:59,030
but with AI now right you can go after

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,760
and take out the insights from all of

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,010
that data and apply it back to deliver a

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,900
much superior customer experience as

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,500
well as improve your products and

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,720
services the second thing that we looked

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,849
at or and what these are performers are

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:20,030
doing is the amount of energy and focus

00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:23,900
they have on building out their digital

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:25,849
and data infrastructure and we see this

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,440
repeatedly in engagements that we do

00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,110
with our customers

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,430
you're gonna really struggle in scaling

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:37,220
up AI in the enterprise without a really

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,160
strong data and digital foundation now

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,230
ai is not sort of a plug-and-play

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,870
you can't just buy intelligence and

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,940
apply to you business problems yes there

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,600
are building blocks available to get

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,570
started the real hard work of managing

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,480
the interplay between data processes

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,470
technologies all happens in house and

00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,910
that's where you create sustained value

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,120
so one of the other things that these

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,850
and prices are doing in this day as part

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,790
of the data strategy is you know really

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,440
focusing on a globally relevant but

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,780
regionally tailored approach to data

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,180
privacy again if you think about if you

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,620
want to go after delivering a superior

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,510
customer experience you want to use all

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,120
that customer data to deliver that

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,400
experience you better have a really good

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,800
handle on how you handle that customer

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:33,260
data and data privacy now the third area

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,980
that you know we when we looked at this

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:40,240
survey results was and this is sometimes

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:44,030
you know not your top of mind for

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,490
executives is the real management

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,670
actively managing the workforce

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:52,550
transformation that is needed to scale

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,650
AI in the enterprise now if you look at

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,480
the study results you know it's it's a

00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,290
common refrain and the biggest challenge

00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,920
and barrier to AI adoption is a lack of

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:05,450
skill resources right and usually that

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,480
means or we don't have the technical

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,580
resources to implement AI we have a lack

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,740
of data scientist data lack of data

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,170
engineers and that is true but one of

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,060
the other areas where enterprises are

00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,940
really struggling with right and have an

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:24,170
equally large gap is in individuals who

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,090
understand both business and AI right so

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,800
what is our performers are doing really

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,860
is taking a much more holistic approach

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:35,000
to this work force transformation right

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:38,630
they're looking at not only you know the

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,390
shift that's taking place right and it

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,660
is it's a nuance

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:47,540
of you know how you have to look at your

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,020
workforce as we move to a much more of a

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,940
human class machine world right so

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,290
they're looking at you know actively

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,720
looking at how to manage the the lack of

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,030
skills the risk killing the retraining

00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,840
that is required the process

00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,330
reengineering

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,180
and the workflow changes that have to be

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,090
managed as humans and machines work

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,220
together so what I would like to do is

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,920
just next you know just talk a little

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,650
bit about you know for companies that

00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,200
that I picked out from which we have

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,180
worked with right they they are all in

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,680
different organs different industries

00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,500
they come from three different

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,280
continents but what is sort of common

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:34,100
across what they have done to scale AI

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,830
in in their enterprises is four things

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,170
right they had a very clear strategy in

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:42,050
terms of you know what value that

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,930
business value they were going after by

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,240
applying AI second they had a very you

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,100
know structured approach to execution in

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,930
terms of when they picked up pilots

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,710
right tied back to your business value

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:58,940
and very clear criteria of moving those

00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:03,110
pilots from there to production and they

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,840
understood and underpinned that with you

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,460
know a strong data and digital

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,770
infrastructure right whether they had it

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,290
or the the event after building it at

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,660
out as part of this process and they

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,430
actually actively managed the workforce

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,830
transformation so let me take the

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,860
example of trade mutual right it's a

00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,980
French bank and they have you know

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,510
twenty thousand advisors across five

00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,420
thousand branches and they are the

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,640
primary face of the bank to their

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,420
customers and the challenge that they

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,900
were having was the volume of you know

00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,479
enquiries that they were getting online

00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,330
was around three and fifty thousand a

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,030
day right and these queries about you

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,820
know products services you know accounts

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:52,310
whatever right and these advisors were

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,699
getting completely bogged down by having

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,870
to focus on

00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:59,089
responding to you know peeing and

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,069
responding to those increase rather than

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:03,829
spending time working with their

00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:05,930
customers to resolve their problems so

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:08,089
Craig Mitchell decided to you know I'd

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:10,730
you know apply air and build up systems

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:13,220
to help their advisors to drive better

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,649
customer service and then yeah they

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,680
piloted it got some really great results

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:19,879
and then went to production and when

00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,279
they went to production they didn't

00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,170
actually see the the results that they

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,569
were seeing in the pilot and what they

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,910
found was you know that the advisors

00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:30,709
were resorting back to their old habits

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,050
of going back to the old systems and

00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,120
which was taking up a lot of time so

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:39,170
they put in place a dedicated change

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,110
management team to actively drive the

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,420
adoption with the advisors and as that

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,550
went into effect they saw some really

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,499
stunning results both in advisor

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,170
satisfaction customer satisfaction and

00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:53,509
the amount of cross-sell upsell that the

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,949
advisors were driving I'm gonna run out

00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:57,230

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,970
customer facing applications while

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,850
Woodside which is an oil and gas company

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,689
