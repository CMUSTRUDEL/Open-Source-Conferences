I thought I'll start with the quote from

00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,580
Tom Friedman most of you know probably

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,110
know Tom Friedman he'd about the book

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,840
the world is flat

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,049
just on the dot-com boom time which was

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,380
very popular he's a New York columnist

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,670
and he decently wrote we're in the

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,670
middle of a change in the climate of

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,350
Technology we're moving into a world

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,640
where machines and software's can

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,239
analyze optimized prophecies customized

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,980
digitize and automate just about any job

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,710
and this is transforming every industry

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,559
and I'm sure all of us can experience

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,290
you know in our everyday life you know a

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,010
simple example to come in here today

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,510
I'll probably I check into my google map

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,129
yesterday to see if I have to come in

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,460
here by 7:00 II and what time I should

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,230
start and base it applied its algorithm

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,910
and technology to and patterns to say

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,219
you know what time I should start with

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,629
the radiance of about 30 minutes but

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,579
because I connected it to my calendar

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:03,899
you know it started prompting in me

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,400
since morning to what time I should

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,510
start because now it has access to

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,890
real-time data and it knows you know

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,180
when do I have to start and in case if

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,340
something changes it can give me an

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,080
optimized suit on the way so the

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,259
connectedness of experience is important

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,390
I think the point I'm trying to make is

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:24,659
number one we are living in a world of

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,689
machine first both in a personal life as

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:31,079
well as in a professional life and

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:34,200
secondly to deliver a quality of

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,689
experience which is consequential you

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,439
know the ability to analyze ability to

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:44,070
optimize ability to predict and the

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,729
ability to take actions you know the the

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:52,290
interconnectedness is key to deliver

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,750
superior experience and we have we

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,920
believe that you know the the businesses

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,939
need to adopt the same in a business 4.0

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,729
world the HR machine first world that

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,550
we're living in and we think the

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,190
cognition and automation needs to be

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,629
combined there needs to be an ability to

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,240
build a contextual awareness in an

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,850
enterprise

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,500
you know whether it's between my

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:20,110
business to business processes to

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,940
application to infrastructure so that I

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,800
have a context not just based on the

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,240
historical data and patterns but also

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,560
based on the real time you incent

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,300
situations so I can make sense out of it

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,160
it's important for us to understand the

00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,520
change understand the impact of the

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,870
change and that situational awareness is

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:44,440
key for providing accuracy in our

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,570
recommendations it's important to be

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,880
able to analyze effectively to do both

00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,790
what we call the what if and if what

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,560
analysis our ability to predict what

00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,840
will happen if there's a change or an

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,820
incident that takes place but also our

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,710
ability to recommend that you know if

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,680
that happens how do you resolve the

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,200
problem and then our ability to actually

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,110
use the atomized skills and then compose

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,090
them on the fly to provide an experience

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,160
which is contextual to the problem

00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,410
rather than have a fixed trips or a

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,650
fixed approach to a problem and the

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,690
interconnectedness of that is key and we

00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,400
had agitate built our entire business on

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,140
that philosophy everything that we do in

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,940
our products everything that we do is

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,320
around those forums so parameters

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,030
whether it's with respect to workloads

00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:35,170
or with respect to AI ops or the digital

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:40,810
workspace sa POS or cognitive

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:43,780
procurement the so we combine the

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,750
contextual intelligence we come to

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,710
deliver you know what more accurate and

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,200
understanding of the normal behavior of

00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:55,810
an enterprise it gives us a much better

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,460
ability to detect an anomaly and to be

00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,720
able to forecast the impact much more

00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,700
accurately than anything else

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,430
and to be able to make sense out of it

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,650
because we have skills to execute it

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,630
also allows us to understand what are

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,820
the options that one one could explore

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,320
what are the probable cause and then the

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,800
recommendations to be able to fix and

00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,580
then go ahead and sell feel it I'll take

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:24,190
an example of workload you know I think

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:26,010
as we all probably know the IT is a

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,160
composition of

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,120
transactional processing systems and

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,810
systems which are learning were closed

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,000
in the asynchronous fashion and we have

00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:39,120
the complexity of an enterprise you know

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,040
we have the scale issues and we and then

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,930
you know we have we need to have an

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,910
ability to respond to a business problem

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,740
so workloads typically in any large

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,460
enterprise they run into hundreds of

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,830
thousands if not millions the they're

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,740
highly interconnected a simple example

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,170
like a product information could form a

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,550
part of many different jobs and they

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,220
made and many different correlations

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,120
were they to this we to ecommerce supply

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,870
chain product lifecycle management and

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,700
they would be running in different

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,860
sequences different times of the day

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,680
different frequencies different they

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,780
would be triggered by different events

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,060
the relationships are complex and

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,000
they're always changing depending on how

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,790
the enterprise business is performing

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,890
and being able to make sense out of all

00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,050
of this today is difficult and most of

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,330
the enterprises at best react to the

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,550
situation and mind you these are

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,170
problems that impact us day-in day-out I

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,540
mean if you're an online banking and if

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:38,310
the service certain service is down your

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,410
contract may say something online but if

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,810
it doesn't come up in 10 to 15 minutes

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,270
to to starts lighting up if I'm a

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,430
merchant you know for a credit card

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,860
company and if I my payment doesn't come

00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,780
on time it's an issue these are all real

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:55,020
life or real life examples which are

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:59,160
impacted by inability to perform certain

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,320
jobs on time and so what we've done is

00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,460
that you know the combining all those

00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,560
four capabilities you know I think we we

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,460
have built the ability where you can

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,900
predict you know in terms of not only

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,310
you can build a relationship based on

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,100
contextual intelligence you can also

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,360
predict in terms of what would happen if

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,210
this if there's a change in the

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,690
enterprise we can adapt to those changes

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,000
in a much more meaningful fashion and we

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,390
can also you know prevent those changes

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,270
from happening and I think we have a

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,610
session later in the day given that I

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,169
have only five minutes here I think at

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,389
11:05 my colleague in the CTO

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,800
they would go to probably a lot more

00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,310
detail in terms of how are we addressing

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,139
the complexity in workload automation

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,909
with machine learning I would encourage

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,190
each one of you to join there thank you

00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,180
very much

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,180
