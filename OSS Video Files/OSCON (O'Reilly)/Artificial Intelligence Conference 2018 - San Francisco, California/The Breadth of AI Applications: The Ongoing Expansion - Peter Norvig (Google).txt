Title: The Breadth of AI Applications: The Ongoing Expansion - Peter Norvig (Google)
Publication date: 2018-09-07
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - San Francisco, California
Description: 
	In 2011, we saw a sudden increase in the abilities of computer vision systems brought about by academic researchers in deep learning. Today, Peter Norvig explains, we see continued progress in those fields, but the most exciting aspect is the diversity of applications in fields far astray from the original breakthrough areas, as well as the diversity of the people making these applications.

now maybe we're at his phase where the

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,490
practitioners can come in and say I'm

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,370
not an expert in machine learning but I

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,830
do have a problem I want to solve I know

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,080
how to how to address that problem and

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,990
can the tools that are available today

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,029
help me get there and what I want to do

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,100
now is show you some of my favorite

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,830
examples of people who have done exactly

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,230
that

00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,019
so we start off with a group of

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,500
astrophysicists at Stanford who had the

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,510
problem of solving gravitational lensing

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,000
equations so what does that mean it

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,520
means there's a galaxy far away it's

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,739
light it's coming towards Earth and in

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,989
between there is another galaxy that

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,730
bends the light and if we could figure

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,340
out exactly what's going on we could

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,809
essentially way that galaxy and figure

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,719
out some interesting stuff about dark

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,489
matter and so on and the way physicists

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,890
have been solving that problem is saying

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,469
we have physics equations that go in the

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,260
forward direction if I knew exactly what

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,150
these galaxies were like then I could

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,979
predict what the light is is like so I

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,680
got to run that on my supercomputer and

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,200
compare that the light I actually see on

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,360
the telescope and if it's wrong then I

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,290
twiddle it a little bit and try again a

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,770
long error-prone process these

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,630
astrophysicists as I'm a physicist I

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,430
know how to do that I don't know

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,040
anything about this machine learning

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,770
stuff but from what I read in the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,479
newspapers and so on I understand that

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,450
they can differentiate and they can go

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,640
backwards rather than forwards to say

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,329
from the light can I go back to what the

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,189
model is maybe that would help and in a

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,009
couple of months they were able to make

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,649
that work and result in something that

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,630
runs ten million times faster now that

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,130
was a great advance that they very

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,590
quickly learned everything they needed

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,000
to do and solved it all by themselves of

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,950
course these are physicists we're

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,500
talking about so these are people when

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,869
you say the word tensor as in tensor

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,250
flow they don't get nervous they say ie

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:11,670
tensors for breakfast another similar

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,920
example here so this is the Kepler

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,660
telescope which is trying to find

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,890
exoplanets trying to find planets around

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,540
other stars I was at NASA in 2000 and I

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,780
worked on sort of a precursor mission

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:29,310
called Sofia and the idea is that a

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,170
planet orbits this other star and forms

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,540
an eclipse and so the light from the

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,840
star is decreased and we should be able

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,400
to recognize that and back in 2000 when

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,959
we were thinking about that we said

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,360
we're going to use sort of standard

00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,280
statistical techniques and we think

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,140
those techniques are good enough that if

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,910
it's a really big planet that's really

00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,440
close to the Sun that's going to block

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,300
enough light we're going to be able to

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,709
detect it and that's exactly what

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,510
happened and the first couple hundred

00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,269
exoplanets were discovered by those

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:00,120
techniques once we've mined all that

00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,709
data now we say we want to do more we

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,480
what we want to say are they're smaller

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,790
planets that are hidden out there and

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,370
now the statistical models just weren't

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:11,880
precise enough we need a new model that

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,400
would pick up all the vagaries of what

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,250
else is going on is the light of the

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,160
star varying is there an asteroid field

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,109
in between or so and so we applied deep

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,049
learning to that and we're able to go

00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:28,160
back and find new planets that were

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,160
undiscovered before

00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,270
