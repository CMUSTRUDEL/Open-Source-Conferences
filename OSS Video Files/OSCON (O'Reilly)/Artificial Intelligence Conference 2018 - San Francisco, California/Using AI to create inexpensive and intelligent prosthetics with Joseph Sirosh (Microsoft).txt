hi I'm Roger McGough listen I'm here at

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,960
the AI conference in San Francisco 2018

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,780
and I'm here with Joseph Siraj who I

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,460
actually know well and has come with an

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,019
exciting prop you've covered so many

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,800
interesting things what are you working

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:21,029
on now yeah this is a an arm that can

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,570
see that's what Soho it's a it's 3d

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,300
printed

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,720
it's got a camera and the palm of its

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,240
hand it's connected to the cloud now a

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,570
computer vision service in the cloud can

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,329
recognize what the object the arm is

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,390
seeing and then can trigger the grip

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:43,379
movements so you can grasp that object

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,100
right so that behavior is synthesized by

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:51,270
the AI service now this what the amazing

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:56,579
thing is how cheap it is it is made out

00:00:51,270 --> 00:01:00,000
of Raspberry Pi and Arduino board a few

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,579
servo motors and the whole thing cost

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,619
about a hundred dollars now of course

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,500
the magic really is in the cloudy eye

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,229
service the cloud AI service you can

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,990
train it you can set it up to generate

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,229
the behaviors you want so if you want to

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,600
grab a key well then you learn to

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,369
classify the grip required you've got

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,049
the key and then with sort of a muscle

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,090
sensor you can trigger that movement and

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,710
it'll grab it right and if you want to

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,280
grab a wineglass you hold it like this

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,500
and it will recognize a wineglass and do

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,909
what's got a palmer grab just close the

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,710
fingers around it so you can lift the

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,930
wineglass up and then with again a

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,659
muscle flexo releasing that one you can

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,409
keep it back imagine and imagine if

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,759
every prosthetic device was like this I

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,070
mean it's very transformative because

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,860
today like the Bionic comes you get it

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,470
costs tens of thousands of dollars this

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,549
is hundreds of dollars it's backed by a

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,979
cloud service

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,280
so it's trainable adaptable the device

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,750
you can adapt to yourself as opposed to

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,390
you know look at the prosthetics today

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,159
yeah you have to train your body and

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,380
your nervous system to control it and

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,860
literally force your will into those

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,599
devices it's like you are adapting the

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,740
device as opposed to the device adapting

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,930
to you and if you

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,030
SiC if you're tired and if you can

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,220
really make those nervous twitches you

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,020
need to control it well then that arm is

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,400
not very functional anymore either but

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,840
that's not the case with the service

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,850
where the behavior is generated by the

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,490
cloud that lets mortals that are driving

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,460
it it never gets tired it's there 24 by

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,710
7 and it's personalizable it's adaptable

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,290
and you know your friends could generate

00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,280
behaviors for you if you wanted that

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,740
might be useful in different

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,500
environments and very powerful when you

00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,020
think about AI backing up every

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,670
prosthetic device in the world

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,160
yeah and just mentioning the world it

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,310
sounds like at that price point the

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,370
availability you know WH o estimates

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,670
there are 32 hundred million people who

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,640
live with a limb loss and only 5 to 15%

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,200
have access to a prosthetic device now

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,240
we are talking about something at that

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,880
price point where everyone could get it

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,560
and again availability of this is

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,330
completely changed when something like

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,980
this can be 3d printed gave me a mass

00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,720
manufacture it's off-the-shelf

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,700
electronic components and you get it to

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,680
a point where look you can this becomes

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,980
replaceable you know the thing one I

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,560
write about it is one doctor was

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,010
observing that if you if you take a

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,610
prosthetic device or an arm from a

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,800
handicapped patient to even clean it etc

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:39,600
that patient keeps looking at you to see

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,760
what are you doing with our precious arm

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,010
of mine are you handling it carefully

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,260
it's become such a part of their body

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,300
that it's because it's a one-of-a-kind

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,000
thing and they've gone to such great

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,280
extent to get that thing to work with

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,830
them and this these sort of things

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,960
changed again and that's the war power

00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,520
right and so but again the the main

00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,900
difference and we've heard these

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,630
physical devices and prosthetics

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,920
processes for 2700 years actually the

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,840
first one do you know where the first

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,840
process is well I know but I I know that

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,970
I know they are old yeah you know the

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,280
first process is that we know of in

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,420
human history is an artificial tall and

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,800
Egyptian mummy from 2700 years ago and

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,460
then there is even in the medieval era

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,360
the Knights there

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:32,069
surviving iron arm of a knight from the

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,259
medieval era here lost his arm ain't got

00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,360
an iron ah well I mean these things have

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,030
been physical devices right and

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,879
materials have improved but nothing has

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,830
given it intelligence and now you have

00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,490
the power of intelligence in a cloud

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,039
service the cloudy eye service is the

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,469
one generating behaviors it's a trick

00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:54,990
giving your autonomy I mean it's very

00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:57,139
powerful I mean given what's happening

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,330
is given your goals and your constraints

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,849
the service B generates a behavior for

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,440
you as opposed to you fine gain

00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:06,780
controlling it right now why would I

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,719
know about AI and how these things work

00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,360
yeah does being in the cloud mean that

00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:13,469
everyone is training everyone so in

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,449
other words if you get one of these

00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:17,370
grips that works does everyone have

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,840
access to it later and that's a

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,620
possibility right there you could set it

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,460
up to have access to the right things so

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,830
you can pool data okay pull data certain

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,590
things become so much more accurate and

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,560
reactive you can have other people your

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,000
friends create skills for you I mean you

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,310
may not have imagined certain skills you

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,039
might have a in the cloud a huge library

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:44,279
of possible skills that you can pick

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,889
from kind of a github of exactly and

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,599
it's like you know they're downloading

00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:50,909
behaviors for these can be like

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:52,440
downloading an app or something and then

00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:54,960
you test it and see if it works and so

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,639
so an unlimited sort of possibilities

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,199
open up when you have the cloud

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,060
connectivity and then there it's an AI

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,370
service and then you can link it to

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,139
other things and so on that's sort of

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,629
that magic of transformation digital

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,919
transformation is not just about AI by

00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,719
the way right it's not just about a

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,819
neural network that runs just in this

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,770
one it's that power of the cloud

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,120
services software as a service and the

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,159
connectivity it brings and a

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,409
globalization of brings and by the way

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:21,479
that's the same digital transformation

00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:24,029
every company and every piece of

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,770
software is going through I am this

00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:28,469
might be an example on a prosthetic case

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:30,020
but look everything in the world is

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,449
going to be backed by a cloud service

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,940
the connectivity the potential of

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,340
pooling the data the way to generate new

00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,889
behaviors the way to share

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,460
appropriately and just keep improving

00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,560
continuously in fact I remember from one

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,510
of your early conferences right web 200

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,780
or something he said what's different

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,790
about the platform of today right the

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,880
fact that traditional software doesn't

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,280
improve but this new software constantly

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,850
improves that's a difference right right

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,500
so I think you've hit on when people

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,729
talk about the cloud and they're like

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,430
what does it mean and stuff I think

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:10,290
you've hit on why it's so important and

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,910
from our perspective it's the fastest

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,370
growing topic on our learning platform

00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,360
of the major topics right even though

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,160
it's been around for a while it's

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,979
because I think what you're explaining

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,870
so this is so interesting thanks for

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,250
doing such great work for the world and

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,729
thanks for your time yeah Thank You

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,479
Roger

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:26,479
it's a pleasure

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,610
