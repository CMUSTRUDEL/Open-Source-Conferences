Title: Beyond Hype: AI in the Real World - Julie Shin Choi (Intel AI)
Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - San Francisco, California
Description: 
	From powering AI clouds to changing the way visual effects are created with machine learning, Intel AI is working side by side with a diverse range of organizations across the globe to accelerate their AI transformation. In this keynote, Julie Choi explores three real-world use cases featuring a diverse set of data centric problems and Intel solutions. Julie also welcomes Ariel Pisetzky, the Vice President of IT at Taboola to discuss how AI is transforming their business as they create personalized content through their predictive recommendation engine.

the second example I'd like to walk

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,890
through comes from Hollywood how many of

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,429
you have watched the movie the Meg OKC

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,650
one all right you guys this is like the

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,920
best shark movie maybe after sharknado

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,750
and Jaws okay so you really need to go

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,850
see this if you haven't I bet you did

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,789
not know that the prehistoric Megalodon

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:26,580
that stars in the Meg was actually

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,130
rendered using machine learning so let's

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,260
watch a video where Ziva dynamics and

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,680
scanline visual effects talk us through

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,489
how they created it when working on

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,829
creatures the very important aspect if

00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:43,320
if not the most important aspect is to

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,719
create an underlying machinery that

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,879
triggers all the different aspects of

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,129
anatomy at the right time it's a very

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,079
complex relation between all of these

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,390
different aspects the ways that we use

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
Intel Xeon scalable processors is to

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,960
generate amazing training data so like

00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,640
if you look at like all the complex

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,559
motion that you see on the gills like

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,719
all the wave propagation that you see

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,890
all that stuff is a product of running

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,890
simulations using our software

00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:16,470
[Music]

00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,780
so y'all need to go see that again top

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,500
shark movie after sharknado I mean

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,729
that's incredible

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,190
so making the Meg real what James was

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,200
saying from Ziva dynamics I mean what we

00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,900
did was learn from the movements of the

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,420
shark creating models that studied the

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,220
anatomy as well as the flow that the

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,930
shark took through the water to help

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,170
create this incredibly photorealistic

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,000
creature that's you know Hollywood scale

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,680
and if you look at the sheer amount of

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,170
data that was processed we're talking

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,630
about 2 million you know just millions

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,330
and millions of 2d and 3d images being

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,060
processed on tens of thousands of Intel

00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,490
Xeon CPU cores and ultimately what

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,649
that's delivering is savings in time

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,200
we're able to see these photorealistic

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,110
creatures created not so much in

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,070
thousands of human hours but just like a

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,070
few machine hours

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,260
