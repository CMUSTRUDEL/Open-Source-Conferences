	00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:06,450
so when we consider AI today we need to

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,990
think as much about power as we do about

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,490
tech right now Facebook that company

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,530
that was in DC talking about

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,619
misinformation yesterday if you followed

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,330
that has a team of 60 engineers that

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,400
working to build a brain computer

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,039
interface that promises to let you type

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,560
with your mind they put it this way

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,930
quote we want to create a digital

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,179
assistant that can literally listen to

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:33,390
your thoughts anywhere and at anytime

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,809
and privately wait privately you might

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,850
ask well of course by privately what

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,250
they mean is without you having to say

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,500
anything out loud they do not mean

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,550
without you giving facebook the ability

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,200
to literally listen to your thoughts

00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,780
Microsoft is also in the mix naturally

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,340
it published a patents a little over six

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,590
months ago titled changing an

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,480
application state using neurological

00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,399
data you wear some kind of fancy

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,079
headband and presto you can use your

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,290
thoughts to close a browser tab it's the

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,990
same premise now never one to shy away

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,990
from futurist fantasies there's Elon

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,720
Musk's neural link a company developing

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,659
an ultra high bandwidth syringe injected

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,950
neural mesh meant to embed itself in the

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,960
brain cool I guess this is one more step

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,299
toward his dream of avoiding human

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,380
obsolescence or maybe Elon obsolescence

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,930
by connecting humans to computers now

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,700
neural link promises direct lag free

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,159
interactions between our brains and

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,560
external devices so you can control your

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,810
phone your kness thermometer your smart

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,450
home your smart city whatever using only

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,950
your minds and I don't know maybe this

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,259
sounds appealing to you to me it sounds

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,740
terrifying and creepy but either way

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,689
such a thing doesn't just happen it

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,450
requires a lot of centralized

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,070
infrastructure and indeed if you dig a

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,079
little bit deeper you'll see that most

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,119
of the neural link job ads are looking

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,890
for infrastructure folks they're looking

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,020
for people able to build an end-to-end

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,969
development storage and compute pipeline

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,979
able to scale to petabytes of data and

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:12,120
hundreds of developers across multiple

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,890
clouds so translation your thoughts in

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,780
the form of neural data measure

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,760
via this embedded brain mesh will be

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,040
sent to knurling server infrastructure

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,209
where this data will be stored

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,069
interpreted processed and almost

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,690
certainly used to train and calibrate

00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,209
the next generation of brain models

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,530
which neural link relies on to interpret

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,530
your thoughts in the first place

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,950
