	00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,319
all right good morning everyone I'm the

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,480
Mantis akan the head of product for

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,030
cloud III building blocks and solutions

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,920
here at Google today I'd like to walk

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,290
you through how we're helping developers

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,540
to easily add a layer of intelligence

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,710
into their applications without any

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:22,109
prior need of machine learning expertise

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:24,449
now I think we all can agree oh this is

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,300
my static slide excellent I think we can

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,150
all agree that the capabilities of AI is

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,309
not in question anymore a our research

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,130
has shown that it can and does power

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,079
real-world applications however when we

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,820
talk to our customers one thing I hear

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,160
quite often honestly is that they're

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,140
frankly struggling to get the

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,750
capabilities of AI into their businesses

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,000
and their and applications and when you

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,730
double-click on why that's the case one

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,879
thing becomes obvious there is a severe

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,199
shortage of AI talent in the world take

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,149
a look at this graph we're estimating

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,280
that there may be thousands of deep

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,430
learning researchers out there maybe a

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,229
million or two data scientists but there

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,420
is an order of magnitude more developers

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,210
out there 20 million or so even more

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,080
ready to adopt AI but don't have the

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,580
tools or means to do so that's why our

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,549
mission here at Google is to democratize

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,250
AI and to make it fast easy and useful

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,290
for everybody we think that machine

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,490
learning is a fundamental cloud

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,380
technology that's going to revolutionize

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,390
the way that we do things in the cloud

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,009
and in enterprise we want to make sure

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,450
that everyone has access to it and the

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,159
way that we want to tackle that mission

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,049
is of course to meet the customers

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,030
wherever they might be in their journey

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,159
and we do that by offering a

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,070
comprehensive suite of products

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,810
primarily in three categories at the

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,180
bottom layer here is our platform

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,040
products our goal there is very simple

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,960
we want to be the platform of choice for

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,880
data scientists we want to enable them

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,369
to create great powerful models iterate

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,340
on them management manage them and also

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,630
connect to a powerful strong community

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,899
of data scientists one of the largest

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,750
through Kaggle at the middle layer is

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,069
our what we call our building blocks

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,200
primarily geared towards our developer

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,140
friends and the goal there again is

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,890
twofold either give them off the shelf

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,590
ready to go

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,340
pre-trained api's often trained with

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,880
Google's vas proprietary data sets with

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,130
little or no ml expertise or again give

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,960
them a custom model building tools so

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,940
that they can create specialized models

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,310
for their needs that they might have

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,100
especially for higher accuracy

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,440
situations and finally at the solutions

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,210
layer at the very top we basically work

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,090
through our partners and be their AI

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,410
engine as they tackle the most thorny

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,510
workflow challenges in the enterprise

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,480
such as customer service and contact

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,980
centers and whatnot now I'm a product

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,150
guy of course I would love to stand here

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,980
and talk to you about every single

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,209
hexagon in my team that'd be great I

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,070
don't think I have done much time with

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:58,770
the guys today so let me double-click on

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,690
one technology that I think is

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,140
fundamental and crucial for our future

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,989
as an industry and that is Auto ml now

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,170
ml is complicated it takes numerous

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:14,130
steps to create a successful model let

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,500
alone deploy it in the wild even if you

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,780
deploy it sometimes you have to go come

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,340
back and reiterate and and you know go

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,580
through the steps again it is not the

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,480
way to Frank to scale machine learnings

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:31,560
power to masses that's why we designed

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,600
other ml simply put our ml abstracts the

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,850
most complicated aspects of machine

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,370
learning model creation and it automates

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,410
this process and to end from data

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,140
pre-processing to model design to

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,420
deployment and it then gives you an easy

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:50,010
and relay to go REST API that you can

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,650
scale as you wish now how does this work

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,820
very simply for my user perspective but

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,250
of course a lot of research and science

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,590
went into it from Google side but very

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,880
simply our customers come and upload

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,290
their training data into our ml you I it

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,880
doesn't even have to be labeled we have

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,370
actual labeling services that's at your

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,130
convenience you can use and once you

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,709
upload that training data our ml on the

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,620
backend builds hundreds of different

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,940
models using latest AI research

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,979
technology such as transfer learning

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,830
that the neural architectural search

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,580
picks the highest most accurate model

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,860
for your needs

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,270
hooks it up to an API you're ready to go

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,700
you didn't have to know what happened

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,750
under the gray

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:33,670
under the hood and the first domain that

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,960
we tackled without FML without ml vision

00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,340
this was a great hit a lot of people

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,620
tens of thousands of people are now

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,910
using this which is great but we know

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,630
this is a very powerful technology

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:45,370
that's why recently at Google cloud next

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,920
we announced that we now have our ml

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,660
available immediately for natural

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,000
language processing as well as

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,620
translation use cases so go check them

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,240
out and you know build your own custom

00:04:53,620 --> 00:05:00,760
models if you wish

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,160
now nothing speaks to the power of

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,750
technology as well as a great customer

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,210
success story and this one comes from

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,890
bloom bloom if you don't know is one of

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,200
the largest furniture hardware

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,490
manufacturer companies out there if you

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,380
have cabinets in your kitchen

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,080
chances are open it up it's a bloom

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,780
hardware in there and bloom what's

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,630
struggling with a fundamental problem

00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,180
they have a vast catalogue of hardware

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,610
but their customers were having trouble

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,380
differentiating among them we have these

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,000
you know two hinges here for instance

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,850
for your review I just got them from

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,990
their website and you know you can tell

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,340
they don't look all that different to me

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,170
but apparent there are two different

00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,780
lines with two different prices right so

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,040
it can imagine a cross of vast catalog

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,110
now the other challenge that bloom had

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,610
is they knew machine learning was the

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,970
answer to solve this problem but they

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,940
did not have any ml expertise in their

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,060
company that's why they turn to our ml

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,740
and in just five weeks

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,050
the bloom team was able to create a

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,180
machine learning model that was 91%

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,530
accurate for their use cases that they

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,050
can deploy into their application for

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,640
their users now that's an amazing result

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,320
that speaks to the power of machine

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,600
learning through our ml but also the

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,550
fact that you do not need to be an ml

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,700
expert to now create these role class

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:19,180
best models for your use cases

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,130
automatically now as I said our mission

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,560
here at Google is to democratize AI and

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,160
to make it fast easy and useful for

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,200
everybody

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,360
I truly hope and look forward to you

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,130
being part of that mission as we try to

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,820
bring the power of AI to everyone in the

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,820
world thank you

00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,380
