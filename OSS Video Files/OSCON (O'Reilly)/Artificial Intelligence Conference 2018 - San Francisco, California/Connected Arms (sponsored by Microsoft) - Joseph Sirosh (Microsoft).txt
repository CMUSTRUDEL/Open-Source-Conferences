	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,340
I believe a is empowerment now this is

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:13,610
an arm that can see it's 3d printed it

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,980
has a camera and the palm of its hand

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:20,039
now it's connected to the cloud the

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,710
magic is in the club as service a

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,080
computer vision service in the cloud can

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,650
recognize the objects that the camera

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,489
sees and generate the grip movements for

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:37,469
the fingers so you can grasp the object

00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:41,040
so let's take a look as the armors

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,719
brought over the object like a key you

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,210
look if you look at the right you will

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,230
see the computer vision service

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,800
classifying the object in this case

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,960
picking a pincer grip and then with a

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,079
flex of a muscle detected by a

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,109
myoelectric sensor you can trigger that

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,199
our movement and pick the key up on flex

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:04,049
the muscle and you release it and I look

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,830
at the wineglass this time it picked a

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,080
Palmer grip folding all the fingers flex

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,810
the muscle grab at pick it up put it

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,600
down and flex the muscle and you can let

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:21,479
it go you know all it takes is a few

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,640
cheap electronic components a Raspberry

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:29,400
Pi and Arduino board a servo motor and

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,540
my electric sensor but of course we all

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,790
know the magic is the cloud AI service

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,090
that's the one that takes an image on

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:43,399
this transit and generates the behavior

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:47,310
the behavior that makes it grasp and

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:50,100
that's learned behavior you train that

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,729
for that behavior and therefore it is

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,390
adaptable so let's see how the grip

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,479
classification works so the input to the

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,990
Raspberry Pi comes from the camera and

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,540
the myoelectric sensor the majors are

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,920
sent to the actual custom vision service

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,800
in the cloud it's an API it's an auto ml

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,110
API in fact and that it can train

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,600
and you can very easily feed at images

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:23,190
and output classes and it will learn to

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,530
do the classification so that holds the

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,070
deep learning model when the image comes

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:32,940
in the classifier classified into one of

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:36,330
a few possible grips and outputs that to

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,460
the Arduino board in the arm which then

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:43,050
triggers the servo motors to close the

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,550
grip the muscle flex is sensed by the

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,500
myoelectric sensor and that's the

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,960
trigger now you could as well have a

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,000
speech trigger if you want it now the

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,390
great thing about something like this is

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,660
architecture is that it's adaptable you

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,100
set it up with the kind of movements and

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,580
the behavior you want this arm to

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,650
generate right and you can customize a

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,900
person using this prosthetic can

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,910
customize it to the objects that you

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,530
care about and the environments you

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,110
could even have a whole library of

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,340
possible behaviors for this which you

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,970
could select from depending on the

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,010
environment you are in anymore even more

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,890
interestingly you know this was actually

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:25,140
built by 200 graduates there's a

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,480
Hawaiian child 3 from the University of

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,209
Ontario Institute of Technology and some

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,480
incon from University of Toronto built

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:40,530
this over a few weeks to take the first

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:43,170
place at Microsoft Imagine Cup 2018 so

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:48,560
why is this revolutionary step back a

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:52,500
second there are over 1 million

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:58,350
amputations per year that's one every 30

00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:00,600
second w-h-o estimates that 30 to 100

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,620
million people live with limb loss

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:07,970
worldwide and only 5 to 15% of them have

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,530
access to prosthesis and even though

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,230
prosthesis have been around since the

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,950
Egyptian times from that artificial toe

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,709
on the Egyptian mummy to a Knights hand

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:23,010
from the medieval times prosthesis have

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:26,430
been severely limited they are limited

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,720
by cost the bionic arm said you can get

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,910
today with sophisticated

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,870
movements they cost tens of thousands of

00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,090
dollars they are limited by availability

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,400
very few people can get them it's not

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,580
like you can order it online get it in a

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,190
package and fit it on your body it is

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,100
limited by the interface the interface

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,040
to your body and what how constructively

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,800
you can make the interface above all

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,430
it's limited by even our own nervous

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,680
system how we train ourselves to use

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,630
these prosthetics you know with these

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,740
prosthetics you literally have to force

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:07,620
your will into them to make them behave

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,780
and if you are sick and if you don't

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,040
have that same ability well then you can

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,810
use that process early very well either

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:19,260
so think about this how could we break

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,820
these limits how could we go beyond what

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,220
we have accepted in the case of a

00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,400
prosthetic for 2700 years that Vee force

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,320
our will into them and adapt to them

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,770
what earth we could build them with

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,930
cheap readily available electronics what

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,860
if we could 3d print them so that it's

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,830
available all over the world anywhere

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:44,460
what if every one of them had a cloudy

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:47,340
eye service backing it up that gave it

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,180
intelligent behavior that was adaptable

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,430
that was personalizable and what if we

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,860
the power of the cloud you could

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,860
transcend your senses and tap into the

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,800
world's knowledge and perhaps even tap

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,919
into a community of people who could

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,820
create new skills and new behaviors for

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:11,910
your prosthetic device and water all of

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,850
these came together at an incredibly

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,820
affordable price like the $100 it cost

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:23,030
to make that 3d printed smart arm that

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:29,850
can see the future of prosthetic devices

00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:33,090
it is an amazing new transformation

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:36,210
driven by cloud and AI imagine where all

00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,479
assistive devices are powered by such

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,340
capabilities imagine a future where

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,810
given your goals and constraints we

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:49,740
to express the actual behavior is

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:52,070
generated by an AI service and imagine

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,540
that's available 24/7 without any

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,050
sickness or tiredness or any of that

00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:01,410
imagine a future where all these devices

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:05,729
really learn to work with you as opposed

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:08,660
to you learning to work with them so in

00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:12,800
the future you're going to see

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:17,280
affordable intelligent cloud powered

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,350
personalized prosthetic devices never

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,430
before in our lifetimes have we had so

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:26,100
much potential have 3d printing

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:31,020
intelligent devices and about all the

00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:33,900
power of a cloud service with AI that

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,389
can learn not just from you but from the

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,400
knowledge of the world and against all

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,070
of this when we apply the ingenuity of

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,650
humankind we are going to build things

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,070
we never imagined like an arm that can

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:51,770
see and millions of people all around

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,770
the world can get a new lease on life

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,050
artificial intelligence is empowerment

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,939
thank you

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,939
[Applause]
