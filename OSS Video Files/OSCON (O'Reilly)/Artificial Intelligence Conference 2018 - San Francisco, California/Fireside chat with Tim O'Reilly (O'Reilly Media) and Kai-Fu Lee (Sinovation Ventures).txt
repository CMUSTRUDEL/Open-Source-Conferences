	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,929
all of you are here at an AI conference

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,029
so you probably all know about Nick

00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,719
Bostrom's paperclip Maximizer you know

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,370
the idea of the AI with the rogue

00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,320
optimization function the size that's

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,029
got to make paperclips and humans are in

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:23,060
the way and in a certain way it seemed

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,060
to me that this hyper-competitive

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,560
situation that you described in china is

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,469
itself a kind of example of a paperclip

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,329
Maximizer where in our society we are

00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:37,950
relentlessly optimizing for a certain

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,290
kind of wealth certain kind of

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:44,040
productivity to the exclusion of human

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,640
life when you talk about 996 as the you

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,960
know the model for how people work and

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,460
you had an experience that you talked

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,289
about in the book that made you question

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,410
that can you share that with us yeah

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,510
absolutely I was a super workaholic I

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,390
used to wake up at 2 o'clock and 5

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,399
o'clock every night because I knew I had

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,920
to check email I was working for Google

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,409
and Microsoft in the China so I wanted

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,100
to make sure my emails were current I

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:13,170
used to work 996 I used to put work at

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,090
priority for everything and leave little

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,900
whatever time I had left with my family

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,830
but I was diagnosed four years ago five

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,600
years ago with fourth stage lymphoma and

00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,810
that early diagnosis really didn't look

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,009
promising and when I felt I had maybe

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,920
months to live

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,810
I suddenly reflected on my life as this

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,450
self optimizing paper clip and it was

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,340
ridiculous how I lived my life and none

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,399
of the things I opted amaizing I care at

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,470
all meant nothing to me my work success

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,350
money fame and nothing at all

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,229
the only thing I wanted to do was to

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,390
spend more time with my family and

00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,759
regret that I haven't done that so that

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,110
was the moment when I came to realize

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:04,649
for myself I need to change my ways

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:07,049
fortunately my cancer is in remission so

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,990
I'm able to spend a lot more time with

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,410
my family when my kids come home

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,510
I drop everything from work I focus on

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,410
their vacation time not my vacation time

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,660
my wife travels wherever we go and and I

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,840
think that experience also comes into

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,810
part of this book in thinking that may

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,900
be the solution to AI taking the routine

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,600
jobs is that the routine jobs makes us

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,970
all into these paper clips and we need

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,510
to take a step back and think where

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,490
humanity put on earth to repetitively do

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,130
all this work or is there something

00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,130
bigger to it so that's why I ended with

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,770
a conclusion that we will one day thank

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,920
a I for taking away the routine jobs and

00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,310
our workaholism and really let us think

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,390
why we live on desert I think that's

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,990
beautiful thank you

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,990
[Applause]

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,010
