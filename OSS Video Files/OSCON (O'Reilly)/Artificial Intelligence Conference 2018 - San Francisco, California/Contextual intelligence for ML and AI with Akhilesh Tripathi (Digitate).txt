I'm Raja my goal is here at the AI

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,299
conference in San Francisco 2018 I'm

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,040
here with a keyless chapathi who the

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,130
chief commercial officer for digitate

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,900
welcome Thank You Roger so I had an

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,030
intriguing first question for you so

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,670
tell me about yourself your name and

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,840
your role at digit 8 so my name is

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,550
Achilles chapatti

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,130
I'm the chief commercial officer with

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,920
digit 8 digit 8 is a software products

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,240
company which is in the business of

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,760
cognitive automation software for

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,140
enterprise so we use artificial

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,660
intelligence and machine learning in our

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,430
product but we do not look at it only

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,440
from an AI and ml and algorithm

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,629
perspective we actually go before and

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,620
after so we combine it with the

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,300
contextual intelligence and with the

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,610
model driven atomized skills for

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,129
automation to provide an in to an

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,120
experience for the customer and we think

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,860
that the contextual intelligence

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,539
provides a lot more accuracy for

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,910
algorithms to be able to predict and

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,530
recommend better and then our model do

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,320
and programmers think of it almost like

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,879
an on-demand automation combines and

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,500
executes employees and into an

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,900
experience to the to the customers and

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,400
we apply that to enterprise IT think of

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:15,630
it for workload a i/o ops ASAP what have

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,369
you so the AI isn't we're in the early

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,650
days I think most people would agree a

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:23,250
lot is going on where do you see the AI

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,100
market going so I think you know the the

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,159
market will mature you know once it goes

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,470
beyond the hype cycle from doing it

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,630
solving a toy problem to solving an

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,130
enterprise problem you know so from just

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,740
getting people excited to actually

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,210
delivering much better much more

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,490
exciting business results for an

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,600
enterprise and that's where we see the

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,509
market going and how is digital

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,430
organizing yourself preparing for this

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,259
changing market Oh we designed ourselves

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,570
for that outcome actually so the whole

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,409
you know the the notion of interpret

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,530
combining

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,119
contextual intelligence with AI and m/l

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,009
based model driven programming for

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,469
prediction forecasting and documentation

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,600
engine and automation is actually to

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,979
deliver them into in value and so from

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,989
day one we are actually serving

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,120
enterprise customers in the enterprise

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:12,730
business solving their end-to-end

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,709
problems

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,300
the domains that we're in so we are very

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,610
excited because you know I think that's

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,299
what digitate is built for so you have a

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,659
product called

00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:25,230
igneel and you know what kind of

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:27,400
benefits what kind of customers are you

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,080
seeing these days right

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,640
so igneous I said is a cognitive

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,720
automation software product which

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,540
provides intelligent automation

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,220
solutions for enterprise IT our

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,579
customers are large fortune 500

00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,530
companies which are large retailers

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:44,590
financial institutions telecom service

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,829
providers manufacturers we cater

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,970
actually most of the industries today

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:53,560
especially enterprise which are large

00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:56,620
and complex and igneel is primarily used

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,859
in the enterprise IT in operation space

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,780
so they're using igni or to make sure

00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:04,390
that they have a much better value out

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,910
of there a I ops which is IT apps

00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,019
application scenario much better value

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,930
out of their workload problems there are

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,349
CP operations and we delivering value on

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,299
business assurance making sure that for

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,910
example if I'm if a large logistics

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,609
player how can they make sure that their

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,410
parcel sorting business is not impacted

00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:28,540
negatively by any technology disruption

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,950
and hence they can have much better

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,590
value to their business or a large

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:35,169
retailer make sure that the peaks is

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,269
seasoned they can accommodate much

00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,569
higher online commerce customers is an

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:42,609
example or a large energy customer or a

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,849
telecom customer to onboard a customer

00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:47,349
or a contractor what would normally take

00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:50,049
them anywhere from two days to a week to

00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,849
no less than 10 minutes for agility so

00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,819
customers are using it for assurance

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,650
business assurance for agility to

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,599
deliver much much faster results they

00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,160
are using it for end customer experience

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,620
and of course they're using it for

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,629
productivity inefficient okay you use

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,639
the word disruption and do you mean in

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:08,769
the sense of things that are uneven or

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,560
like just technology innovation

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,989
disruption so the large enterprises have

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,479
many things that work together to

00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,780
deliver a specific business problem to

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,240
solve a specific business problem and

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,620
normally for and there are so many

00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,860
interconnected pieces and they're there

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,289
and it's a constantly changing dynamic

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,639
so any change somewhere causes a

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:31,229
disruption either upstream or downstream

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,689
because of which the customer

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:36,750
experiences impacted or a business is

00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:39,750
not able to close the transaction so for

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,819
example you know if I'm if I'm trying to

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,039
do an online banking and if certain

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,629
services down we aren't you know beyond

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:47,490
then what it needs to be even in the

00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:49,110
middle of the night that Witter starts

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,120
lighting up because the customers are

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,759
not happy about it as an example and

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,199
that's a better business disruption to

00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,419
okay interruption so AI automation these

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,680
are people are talking about this a lot

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,020
how do you think this is going to

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
disrupt these services industry and

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,599
where do you think this is all heading

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,389
so I'll answer it in two parts so first

00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:13,919
of all I think you know would a I

00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:16,279
machine learning in automation disrupt

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,289
their the way we do things absolutely

00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,669
right but I think you know the I

00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,349
wouldn't think of it in the product

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:24,599
versus services world because my view

00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,400
has been that you know every disruption

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,099
creates new products and create new

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,960
services models it's not either/or right

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,520
so I think as it creates you know

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,520
different operating models for the

00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,139
businesses and creating opportunities

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,580
for products software products it also

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,520
creates new opportunities for the

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,349
services my experience has been the

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,360
technology any new invention the

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,099
technology increases the adoption and

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,930
actually creates more opportunities for

00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,509
everyone rather it doesn't come at the

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,250
cost of anyone so I mean no matter who

00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:55,560
you are how you touch technology it's an

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,599
exciting time for you right sure is yeah

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,020
thanks again for your time thank you

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,020
very much Roger

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,730
