Publication date: 2018-09-06
Playlist: Artificial Intelligence Conference 2018 - San Francisco, California
Description: 
	With the US leading the AI revolution for decades, it would almost seem inconceivable that China could catch up. But China is rapidly catching up with the US in AI applications. Kai-Fu Lee discusses the five key factors that enabled this rapid ascension: tenacious entrepreneurs, speed and execution, tremendous capital, a big market and bigger data, and techno-utilitarian government policies.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
a miracle happened about ten years ago

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,680
this following loop became operational

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,040
and this loop is the combination of

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,660
China's such a large market three times

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,240
larger than us in Mobile

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,940
therefore it attracts a lot of capital

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,220
to invest in it and some of the

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,859
investors in the capital are very smart

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,910
and they guide the entrepreneurs who are

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,730
tenacious and hardworking they work 996

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,160
997 that means 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,840
six days or seven days a week and they

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
build great products and those products

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,329
get even more users and make more money

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,329
and the loop continues and in ten years

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,780
we've gone from early days of copying

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,410
from the US people call Baidu the Google

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,719
of China Sina the Yahoo of China because

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,660
they were pretty much us ideas brought

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,489
over to China but in the green zone you

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,949
see the Chinese companies start to

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,230
localize features and build new products

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,480
that sometimes are better than us

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,909
products for example even in the green

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,729
zone five years ago we chat is a better

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,010
product than facebook Messenger Weibo is

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,260
a better product and Twitter try it if

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,229
you don't believe me and then the

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,990
right-hand orange site actually led to a

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,850
number of companies just in the last two

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,619
years all of these companies start in

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,930
the last two years this is this is not

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,659
AI company these are just consumer

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,880
Internet companies these I won't have

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,479
time to go into any of them but just so

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:37,680
that you know they are no longer the XYZ

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,869
of China that where XYZ is an American

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,780
company all eight companies have

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,659
original innovation in fact a number of

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,060
people are copying them to us Southeast

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,189
Asia in other countries so and these

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,920
companies are not small you can see

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,740
their market market value valuation are

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,409
seventy five billion to two hundred

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:02,040
billion and so these giant technology

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:04,530
innovators have emerged and in creating

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,210
these amazing companies the Chinese

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,050
entrepreneurs have become hardened

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,140
they're tenacious they fight hard unlike

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,400
us where the competition is very

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,430
gentlemanly

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,349
right Instagram would say oh your that's

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,970
the Pinterest job we'll work together

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,799
Pinterest was there that's instagrams

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,769
job we don't we don't get into each

00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:29,780
other space and China very quickly there

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:32,269
will be a histogram which would be one

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,280
by whichever is tenacious stronger has

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:36,319
better strategy I have so much I can

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,959
tell you in stories here but we're

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,680
limited in time but these but I'll just

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,379
tell you if we if Mars suddenly became

00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,109
available for companies to move there

00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:50,180
and that top Silicon Valley entrepreneur

00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:52,459
moves their top Chinese entrepreneur

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,349
moves there I'm afraid the outcome is

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:58,659
likely that the Chinese entrepreneur

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:58,659
will win the market share at the Mars

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,890
