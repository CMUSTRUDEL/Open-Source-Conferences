Roger McGough is here at the AI

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,509
conference in San Francisco 2018

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,130
I'm here with eleventh becak who's a

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,190
group product manager for the Google

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,019
cloud welcome Thank You Roger and uh

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,560
first tell me a little about what you do

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,990
at Google sure so I'm a group product

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,119
lead for our cloud building blocks and

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,730
solution teams and basically what we do

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,590
is provide api's pre-trained models as

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,330
well as customizable models for our

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,340
developers so that they can easily and

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,470
quickly add a layer of intelligence into

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,450
a applications easily without a male

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,850
expertise oh please oh well that sounds

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,190
like you're democrat izing access to

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,140
this kind of data what what kind of

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,059
things your customers looking for so I

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,180
think one thing that we're seeing a lot

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,070
in the industry right now is you know

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,600
people kept saying for awhile oai is a

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,210
hype I think we're over that people

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,309
realize that era has real power and can

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,899
power and does power real-world

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,600
applications there with real and

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,100
business benefits I think what people

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,410
are realizing however is that they're

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,850
still struggling some some cases to

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,799
bring those capabilities into their

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,930
enterprise interference applications and

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,570
when you really double-click on why

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,939
that's the case one thing becomes very

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,850
obvious to us is that there's a severe

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,380
shortage of AI talent integrals we did a

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,380
study and we found that that there's

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,810
maybe a thousands of data deep learning

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,490
researchers out there maybe million or

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,290
two million our data scientist out there

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,020
most of them academia or top tech firms

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,549
but there are 20 plus million developers

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,770
an order of magnitude developers out

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,530
there ready to use AI but just don't

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,200
have the tools or means to do so great

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,759
so in democratizing stuff you mentioned

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,170
trying to adjust the skill deficit what

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,369
kind of things do you do to help them

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,070
get going quickly

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,659
absolutely so first of all we think that

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,340
AI is a very powerful technologists

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,840
really foundational and it's going to be

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,790
revolutionary for obviously how we do

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,219
things in the cloud we think it needs to

00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,420
be really accessible to everyone and

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,570
that's really our mission as you said is

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,000
to democratize AI make it easy fast and

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,430
useful for everyone and we do that in a

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,829
couple of ways first we always want to

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,580
provide developers ways to have

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:13,110
intelligent API such as envision speech

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,310
natural language translation you name it

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,740
or in chat pod

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,870
without the need for ml expertise and we

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,550
do that through our what we call

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,730
pre-trained api's so that's one aspect

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,640
however what we often see in our

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,560
customers is that they might have use

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,390
cases where they need to specialize I

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,400
would specialize that model for their

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,620
use case so you know the imagenet models

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,660
out there are great to differentiate

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,610
from dogs two cats two different items

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,590
but if you want to differentiate between

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,660
say items in your catalogue let's say

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,670
your e-commerce retailer right and you

00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,570
have you know hats and you have bags and

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,640
you have shoes and you want to

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,380
differentiate between all of those you

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,160
need to have a special model and for

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:55,489
that what we is proposing as raml

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,500
basically a way to easily and quickly

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:00,330
provide create machinery models they're

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,850
highly accurate without needing to know

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,160
anything about ml Wow so what kind of

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,310
work does someone have to do to get

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,650
going on that it's it's it's a sexual

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,070
fascinating topic obviously of research

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,080
and science went into this but from a

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,180
user perspective super simple we have a

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,340
simple to use UI all you have to do is

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,660
bring your training data sets let's say

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,100
that you're a retailer for instance you

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,530
have bags of hats and you know shoes

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,930
maybe just label a few images uploaded

00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,700
as your training set and if you don't

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,310
have labeled images that's okay too we

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,950
have actually in our UI capabilities to

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,870
use third-party or internal labeling

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,739
services and then once you upload that

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,120
data behind the scree scenes our ml is

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,430
going to create hundreds of different

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,160
models using later say I research like

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,350
transfer learning does a deep neural

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,630
network architectural search and then

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,519
finds and picks the best model for your

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,769
use case and then hooks that up to an

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,790
API a REST API that's easy to use ready

00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,870
to go and scale

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,400
so again this whole entire process is

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,780
done through a simple to use UI and

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,549
honestly I think this is going to be

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,470
revolutionary because you know up until

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,709
now you know we really need that data

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,970
science a iock expertise to iterate on

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,340
those models to create these high

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,169
accuracy models but now you can actually

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,720
do that simply on a UI based system

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:19,709
great you have any examples of like what

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,229
people have been able to do it I don't

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,240
know yeah quite a few um one of my

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,950
favorites is because I'm now doing a

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,320
kitchen remodel so this actually is very

00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:31,100
very fitting

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,410
a balloon balloon is a furniture

00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,330
hardware manufacturer globally if you

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,710
have kitchen cabinets you know you

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,980
should check them out that chances are

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,810
their bloom Hardware in them and balloon

00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,430
was struggling with basically trying to

00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:49,190
among their best catalog of items that

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,930
have struggling to have their customers

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,670
defend shape between different lines of

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,830
hinges and poles and they knew that AI

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,720
could be the way to do this but they did

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,460
not know how to do that because they

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,710
don't have any AI or Michigan expertise

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,920
in there in their company so they came

00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,640
to odd ml and in just five weeks they

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,920
were able to create 91% accurate model

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,410
to automatically categorize their entire

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,460
catalog for their users now that just

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,440
really speaks to the power of this

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,690
technology you know from nothing about

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,060
knowing about ml to a highly accurate

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,710
model in five weeks and be able to

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,540
deploy it that I think speaks the power

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,220
of the stack no that sounds great

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,380
now there must be some skill level

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,630
people need to have just to get going on

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,060
it were these business people who are

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,350
working with that or like we're

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,050
programmed like what kind of person

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,610
would yeah yeah do well so a very good

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,000
question and also there's a larger

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,800
question you know as people come to AI

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,960
to solve their business problems they

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,690
they come at different phases right in

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,340
different roles so in this specific case

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,050
balloon folks were developers with

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,280
business folks obviously coming in to

00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,440
help use our ml but in general I think

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,750
that's a very key point that you know to

00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,390
be successful and be able to deploy AI

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,000
in in business setting you need to have

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,760
tools ready for whatever phase you're in

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,230
in that journey as Google I think that's

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,200
one of our strong points where we offer

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,960
a comprehensive set of products across

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,240
three major categories first categories

00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,130
are platform products where our goal is

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,810
to really be the best platform the

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,020
platform of choice for data scientists

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,530
right and also be able to connect them

00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,700
to a strong community of data scientists

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,610
through our calculon after because their

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,680
science communities out there the second

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,880
product group that we have is what we

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,740
call building blocks so this is what I

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,090
was talking about earlier i'd appretiate

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,860
api's or

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,070
myzel models through great rml

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,350
technology but then also finally if your

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,840
business user right we also want to be

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,280
able to help you create great solutions

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,169
for your workflow challenges in

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,300
businesses and for those we have AI

00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:59,600
solutions which we primarily work

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,340
through our partners and B there AR

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,590
agent if you will as they tackle these

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,880
uh don't need workflow challenges sounds

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,610
fascinating sounds you're really pushing

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,800
AI down pretty low into the world so

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,940
thanks again for your time thank you

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,940
really appreciate this time

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,090
