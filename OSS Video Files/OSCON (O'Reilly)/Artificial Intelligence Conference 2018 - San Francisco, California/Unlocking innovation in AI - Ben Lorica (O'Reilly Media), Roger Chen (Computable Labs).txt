	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,370
so we wanted to take a few minutes to go

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:11,040
over some transfer seeing in the AI

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:12,860
space obviously a is a big topic so we

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,379
wanted to focus on a few things

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,920
particularly compute and data all right

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,470
so let's go over the state of adoption

00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:25,529
earlier this year we ran a survey and we

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,949
found that many companies are beginning

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,960
to adopt deep learning or expressing

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,690
interest in adopting deep learning and

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
in that same survey we found that the

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,579
main bottleneck was actually lack of

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,390
skilled people so just gives you kind of

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,789
the demand side for AI so on the supply

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,200
side for the labor market we've actually

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:51,239
also noticed a growing trend in people

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,879
interested in learning about AI

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,670
technologies so in our own online

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,280
learning platform where we have over 2

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:04,379
point 4 1 million users we've seen a

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,520
huge surge in interest in AI and there's

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,590
also a few new topics that are kind of

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,189
popping up in our radar so a couple of

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,460
them we ran tutorials on PI torch and

00:01:13,189 --> 00:01:20,820
reinforcement learning so a survey of

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,290
close to 8,000 IT leaders across 84

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,520
countries revealed that more and more

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,500
people more and more companies are

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,070
investing in AI and automation

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,689
technologies but the level of investment

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,640
really depends on a kind of company one

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,890
thing we found is that companies that

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
already regard themselves as digital

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,790
leaders tend to be poor a much higher

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,340
level of investment but you know

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,290
location matters as well too especially

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,420
in China where the business environment

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,070
can be very competitive more companies

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,960
report higher rates of investment as

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,329
well - and later today our closing

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,630
keynote speaker dr. Karen Lee won't be

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,110
able to give a detailed overview what's

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,020
happening the Chinese landscape so we're

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,119
actually about into year seven of the

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,200
kind of resurgence and interest in deep

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,599
learning and I remember in 2013 when I

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,819
first started kind of following deep

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,210
learning closely embedding myself in

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,760
that community

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,070
it was a very small group of people so

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,500
you had to basically apprentice with a

00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,330
few groups in the world so a lot of it

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,820
was based on oral tradition there was

00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:29,880
not a lot of documentation not a lot of

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:32,050
tools but today there's a lot more

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,950
democratization happening around deep

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:38,020
learning so we have big datasets that

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,420
people are sharing we have improvements

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,580
in hardware and software tools

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,870
particularly in open source machine

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,690
learning libraries so what are some of

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,550
these new technologies on the horizon we

00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,780
often talk about mottos but let's take a

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,680
moment here to talk a little bit more

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,940
about the latest with data and compute

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,310
one thing to think about is that

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,740
researchers are always exploring the new

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,420
algorithms but to do that you naturally

00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,730
play with different neural network

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,220
architectures you play with new features

00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,930
new parameters and new optimization

00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,460
techniques and all of that involves

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,340
experimentation that that can take a

00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,250
very long time hours days and sometimes

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,010
even weeks now as a researcher even if

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,040
you have the patience to wait for these

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,390
simulations these experiments to run

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,610
computation is also very very expensive

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,040
so it's a non there's a non-trivial cost

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,360
challenge to innovating in AI as well

00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,970
too so again we're into year 7 of this

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,920
resurgence and interest in in deep

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,110
learning so the way hardware the

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,980
hardware industry moves is first you

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:50,560
kind of figure out what important

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,180
calculations and workload is then you

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,060
figure out if they're enough scale to

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,130
justify specialized hardware so at this

00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,730
point actually we're seeing more and

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:03,330
more new companies affirm that there's

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:06,730
enough scale and there's enough kind of

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,840
compute primitives to build specialized

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,970
hardware so it's not just actually the

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,120
traditional hardware manufacturers right

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,310
so now we're also seeing companies that

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,380
you know normally don't associate with

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,360
hardware who are out building hardware

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,900
because there's just enough scale to

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,900
justify it

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,330
we're seeing a lot of new companies

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,980
specializing new kinds of hardware

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:35,340
targeting particular in particular AI

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,990
workloads now for training for data

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,300
centers in particular what this means is

00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,910
specialized hardware for handling large

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,770
models large data sets and training

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,390
large models and large discs that's at

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,880
the same time we're entering an age

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,490
where we expect billions of devices on

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,580
the edge performing inference tasks like

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,270
image recognition for example now if we

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,800
take a look at the landscape there are a

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,230
lot of these new hardware stars emerging

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,690
both in China and in the u.s. one thing

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,040
that really stuck out to us is the level

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,920
of focus the number of companies are

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,660
pursuing new hardware companies focused

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,940
on edge devices now the developer

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,790
community is already preparing for new

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,140
hardware for example ml perf and other

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,090
programs out there who are thinking

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,530
about how to use new hardware to

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,420
accelerate experimentation and

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,460
innovation but the other part of it too

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,200
is to think about how they can together

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,660
to collaboratively send you benchmarks

00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,370
in the machine learning industry yeah

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,050
it's just an sighs when you think of

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,450
hardware you should actually also think

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,940
of heart the whole suite of hardware

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,190
tools so it's Roger alluded to inference

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:43,770
at the edge is going to be an enormous

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,600
market so not just training but there's

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,300
also more than compute right so there's

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,880
obviously IO bandwidth host bandwidth

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:55,410
and memory as well but with that said

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,320
hardware is still not enough right so

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,390
we're still living in this era where a

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,300
lot of our models are data hungry

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:08,820
specifically reinforcement learning in

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:11,850
the deep learning so if that's the case

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,490
then the companies that are located in

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,040
the big countries so the incumbent tech

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,890
companies seem to have an advantage over

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,320
the rest of us right because they have

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,960
much much larger data sets the good news

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,270
is there's a new set of tools coming out

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,150
that might level the playing field for

00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,070
the rest of us that's right when it

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,330
comes to data human labor there is an al

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,700
leveraging a lot of these machine

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,320
learning tools to make their labeling

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,400
process much more accurate and much more

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,230
scalable and much more

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,790
and we're also seeing new tools

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,580
altogether in certain domains like

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,430
involving ganz as well as simulation

00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,070
engines that allow the generation of

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,750
realistic synthetic data which you can

00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:55,080
then use for training machine learning

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,389
models now beyond generation another

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,490
important aspect of data is data sharing

00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,770
the good news is a bunch of new starts

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,110
now emerging to figure out new tools to

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,910
enable this and some of the technologies

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,710
that they're exploring include the

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,810
incorporation of cryptography block

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,330
change as well as secure communications

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,979
and with these tools giving companies

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,050
the ability to create new forms that did

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,180
networks that allow organizations to

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,570
share data securely and collaboratively

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,280
so if you're interested in data markets

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,080
particularly decentralized state the

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,750
markets actually Roger is giving a talk

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,970
on Friday on a new set of open source

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:35,910
that his startup is building so we have

00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,919
a full slate of sessions for you so we

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,680
only covered barely scratched the

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,840
surface we talked mostly about compute

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,289
and data but obviously this conference

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,260
is going to have a lot of thoughts on

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:53,490
modeling ethics privacy security and

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,349
many other topics so stick around for

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,630
the next two days we have very very

00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:00,500
strong talks all the way to the end of

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,500
