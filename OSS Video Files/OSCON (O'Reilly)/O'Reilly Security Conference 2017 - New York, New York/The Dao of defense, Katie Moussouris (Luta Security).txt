so whether or not you make software

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,169
yourself you are a part of a software

00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:17,200
supply chain somehow so what do you do

00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:19,179
obviously we have to assess our

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,580
capabilities and it's not just in

00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:24,640
engineering we have to get out of this

00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,800
headspace where we tend to be locked

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,779
with our logic and clearly you know if

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,849
we present the exact facts that brought

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:32,740
us to this logical conclusion we present

00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,630
them to other people clearly they are

00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,289
just going to go for it and that's not

00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,000
necessarily the case right setting goals

00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:42,160
especially if you're thinking about

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,289
doing a bug bounty is super important

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,420
because what I see happening today with

00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:50,530
bug bounties is that it's being used as

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:53,199
virtue signaling there's not a lot of

00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,210
preparation going on before people are

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,620
launching bug bounties and they think

00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,250
it's a replacement for a penetration

00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,340
test penetration testers are under NDA

00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,400
it is a low risk and relatively low

00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,670
volume way to hear about bugs that is a

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,400
completely different kind of scenario

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,900
than opening up the floodgates to a bug

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,700
bounty so obviously you know in my

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,829
family I was the mathlete my brother

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,409
actually runs marathons he's he's an

00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:27,850
actual athlete so but you know going

00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:30,100
from couch to a marathon is what I like

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,890
in people just running out and starting

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,229
bug bounties people think people

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:38,110
thinking that they could just get up off

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:40,270
the couch and run to this asymmetric you

00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:44,710
know load of vulnerability is coming at

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,990
them from who knows where so you

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,060
actually can't control what other people

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,689
are going to do you can't control the

00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,979
attackers you can't control the hackers

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,119
but you can control your own actions

00:01:53,979 --> 00:02:00,009
your own preparation your own

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,369
infrastructure and the thing that that

00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:06,280
has been killing me is that we are so in

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,909
love with bugs and it's not really about

00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,330
bugs

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:12,780
it's about our ability to handle the

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,780
