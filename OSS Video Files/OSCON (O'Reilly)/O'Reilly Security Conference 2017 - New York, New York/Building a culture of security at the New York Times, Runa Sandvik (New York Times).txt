	00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:10,849
so I have I think there's four slides

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:14,440
that specifically outline how we go

00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:18,110
about empowering teaching training

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,500
helping others do their work and do so

00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:24,590
securely one example that I usually give

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,689
is that we have a newsroom that I mean

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,949
usually we give this advice when it

00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:32,840
comes to fishing we give this advice

00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:34,789
that says you should not open an email

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,700
from someone that you don't know you

00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:40,039
should not click on a link that someone

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,219
sent to you unless you know who that

00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,410
person is we have a newsroom whose job

00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,640
it is to open those emails and to click

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,270
on those links and to open those

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,789
attachments so it is an our job to help

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,170
them do so securely we can't just say oh

00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:54,800
you can't do that because you don't know

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,859
who it's from

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,480
that is sort of haven't receives tips so

00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:05,210
when it comes to training we really sort

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,250
of work to understand the audience the

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,380
training that we give to the newsroom is

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,720
slightly different from the training

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,070
that we give to legal which is slightly

00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,900
different from the training that we give

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,950
to HR we try to really understand the

00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,170
workflows that these different teams

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,119
have before we go in and do the training

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,479
and in some cases I usually do a

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,390
30-minute

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,579
one-hour meeting with a couple of people

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:34,399
in that department just to fully

00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:36,020
understand their day to day the tools

00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,140
that they work with the questions that

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:41,509
they frequently ask about security the

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,189
challenges that they have what their

00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:45,740
concerns are and then I try to make sure

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:50,750
that I covered those topics in the

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:53,090
training we also did a new hire

00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,280
orientation training as of right now we

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,539
get one full hour with every new

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,490
journalist other times and in many cases

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:05,420
we cover the sort of the usual like

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:07,729
here's how you secure your email account

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,369
here are the settings that we enforce by

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:12,320
default here how that applies to you

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,990
here are things that you should know

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,430
about your laptop but then depending on

00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,370
who's in the audience we mail

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,150
so cover things like our tips

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,579
distribution system we cover things like

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,890
secure mobile communication we give them

00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:29,930
a heads up about phishing training just

00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,049
so that they know that that's coming we

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,090
also go through how to recognize

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:38,480
phishing with actual examples of what

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,400
we've seen in the news room and it's a

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,209
hit or miss sometimes you're talking to

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,739
a graphics editor it doesn't necessarily

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,299
need all that advice and sometimes

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,329
you're talking to an investigative

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:54,439
reporter who absolutely does need that

00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:57,430
advice we also do host sort of bread bag

00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,669
sessions with external speakers

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,400
oftentimes

00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:03,079
and I don't know why this is the case

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,000
but oftentimes getting in someone

00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:08,799
externally who says the exact same thing

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,799
is you seems to be super helpful

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,480
