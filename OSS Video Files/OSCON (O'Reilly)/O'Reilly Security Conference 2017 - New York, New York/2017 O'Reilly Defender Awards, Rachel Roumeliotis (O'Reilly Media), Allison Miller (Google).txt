	00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,360
so last year our first year we started

00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:10,420
this which we hope will be a regular

00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,520
tradition of recognizing the great

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:15,720
contributions to our industry into our

00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:18,550
community that folks are working on

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,669
especially it feels great to be able to

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:24,189
recognize folks for things that haven't

00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:25,929
necessarily been publicly absolute

00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:27,279
Lauren since a lot of defenders end up

00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:29,169
working behind the scenes and in the

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,040
trenches bringing some of those folks

00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:35,680
out is really great so we have four

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,170
awards one two three four and the first

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,000
award is the project award yeah the

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,399
project award so the project award is

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,800
essentially a community contribution

00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,469
kind of it takes a village to sort of

00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,219
pull something together and so last year

00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:55,870
we had the shoulders of InfoSec award

00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,429
went to the social shoulders of InfoSec

00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:05,199
project this year's award goes to den

00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:07,870
Ananda didn't Anna OS query and so Mike

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,030
arpaia tell you read Facebook and Nick

00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,540
Anderson actually who's the new program

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,220
lead on that OS query is a fantastic

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,270
tool that that team developed and

00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,950
released unto the world I think of it as

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,840
instrumenting an entire environment and

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,820
putting it into a sequel database so

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,850
that you can actually query for it and

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,400
it's so useful it's been useful from

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,740
operations teams to security and back

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,810
again it's open sourced

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,170
it has great documentation and support

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,170
so thank you so much to the folks of LSP

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:47,880
I assume Facebook is watching us from

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,720
here so now okay alright

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,649
next up we have the research award and

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,440
this typically goes to an academic or

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,920
some sort of formal research project or

00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:05,610
paper or researcher who has made a great

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,420
contribution and this year's award goes

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,230
to the voting machine hacking village at

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:24,930
DEFCON so actually in here with us are

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:26,640
Matt blaze carry her ste congrats and

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,319
then it will name the folks who are who

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,150
are on the paper and if you are one of

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,459
those people raise your hand

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:37,620
Matt blaze Jake Braun Harry Hurst e

where the words are Margaret MacAlpine

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,880
and and that guy and the last person who

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:54,630
and his name was on the slide Jeff

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,160
oh yes Jeff yes all right and thank you

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,200
Def Con for hosting that and thank you

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,260
guys for writing the paper so thanks

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,390
thanks so much we're we're really

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,530
honored to be here and and we're

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,519
delighted to see particularly

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:16,739
recognition for the importance of wide

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,410
scrutiny for the literal machinery of

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:24,000
our democracy as we've seen it's much

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:27,660
much more fragile than we need it to be

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,549
and it's only through wide scrutiny with

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,400
events like the voting village and with

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,820
the top to bottom reviews that have been

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,420
done that we have any chance of being

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,269
able to to to really trust the integrity

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,660
of our elections and the legitimacy of

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,720
our government so thank you so much

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,720
thank you

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,730
yes and if you want to check out the

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,880
results of that the paper is available

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,260
online so thank you so much for making

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,160
sure that the results were written up

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,560
all right next up is the practitioner

00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,410
award so this typically goes to someone

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,420
who through their day to day work has

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:15,100
been making outstanding contributions

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:18,220
and this year's award goes to Colin

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:26,470
Morgan so Colin Morgan works for Johnson

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:29,770
& Johnson it out here man yeah I would

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,140
continue to talk for a moment included

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,050
just ringing endorsement of his work

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,690
he's worked tirelessly that was in the

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,880
nomination tirelessly to make sure that

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,830
security is incorporated into the entire

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,260
product development process at Johnson &

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,930
Johnson and not only have you you're

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,850
recognized for helping Johnson & Johnson

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:51,220
but actually the entire medical device

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,230
industry which it's kind of important

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,290
that security thankee in place for that

00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:00,120
given the patient health outcomes so

00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,470
thank you so much Colin congratulate you

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,570
thank you and I'd like to thank the

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,560
committee for the recognition and I'd

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,090
actually like to stand up here and

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,290
accept this award at behalf of the

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,880
community were part of and that's in

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,320
healthcare you know there's a lot of

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,910
great people working hard to help

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,920
improve this space which is the top

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,940
target over the past few years and I

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,040
like to give a quick thank you to some

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,330
of those communities so first is to the

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,610
security researchers who are constantly

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,160
finding flaws and helping us improve our

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,110
game - security consultant firms who are

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,540
helping us keep aware of emerging

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,280
threats and solve complex problems to

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,750
our regulators like the US FDA who is

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,370
very collaborative and bringing together

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,180
key stakeholders to try and solve these

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,590
problems to our competitors who in this

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,810
space which many of you may not know we

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,760
work together we share information we

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,020
collaborate well it's not the day

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,370
doesn't go by where I don't talk to

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,780
appear at another company about trying

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,640
to figure out how to solve a problem and

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,930
then finally to our customers such as

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,180
the hospitals who are upping their game

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,710
and forcing us to be more diligent it

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,479
truly is taking a community to defend

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,830
the healthcare cybersecurity space and

00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,340
I'm honored to be a part of it so thank

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:06,290
you

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:08,780
Thank You ruff all right one more we

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,250
have one more and it was interesting

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,800
because we weren't planning on doing

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,420
five Awards this year I'm total but we

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,610
yes in total because we had one

00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,540
yesterday but we have this last one

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,820
because we had a really interesting

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,520
nomination that was actually there were

00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,440
people and the project were nominated

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,320
multiple times in multiple categories

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,560
and we looked at it and we thought well

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,920
let's do it the papers pretty cheap we

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,450
could do another award we could print

00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,870
out another award and we would love to

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:45,140
recognize more great work so we came up

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:48,950
with a fifth category so this year we

00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:52,280
have a people's champion award and the

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:56,150
winner of the people's champion award is

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,430
the authors of improving SSL warnings

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,460
comprehension and adherence Adrienne

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,080
Porter felt Robert reader Alex Ansel

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:08,710
sunny consoled the psalmist I regard

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,710
Alan Betts Helen Harris Jeff Grimes yay

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,800
I want to take a moment to explain the

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,810
complexity of the nominations

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,110
so normally something like this would go

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,210
into a research award but the thing is

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,300
that the nominees kept or the

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,340
nominations kept mentioning is that the

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,410
work that was done in this research

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,560
paper which was sort of foundational in

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,560
and how you can get to better security

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,040
outcomes with better UX it's recognized

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,930
that that is being driven into your

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,720
products and because the research was

00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,430
shared is something that other companies

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,040
can take advantage of which ultimately

00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:52,130
gets us to better security outcomes for

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,080
people which is I think where we as an

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,210
industry want to get to so thank you so

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,840
much to you and the entire team it was a

00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,840
wonderful

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,980
thank thank you that was a great way of

00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:07,440
the work it really is I'm a user

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,360
experience researcher which is maybe the

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,130
unusual discipline to be in security but

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
this is work where we really tried to

00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:16,470
make security better for people

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,840
Chrome users receive tens of millions of

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,440
ssl phishing and Malware warnings per

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,700
month and getting people to not proceed

00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,630
through those warnings was an important

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,940
thing to do because when they do

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,730
security risk happen and we've been able

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:33,930
to drop the click-through rate on those

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,729
work on SSL warnings by 25% or so

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,890
through just making better user

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,260
experiences in the warning itself and

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,669
that's really great to bring UX and

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,289
security folks together to make this

00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:51,870
work happen so I encourage you to think

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:53,100
about usability in your own work well

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,860
one of the things that I think is

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,900
astonishing I mean by the way another

00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,900
round of applause for all the winners I

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,910
don't know about you guys but it's

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,350
actually so much fun just to celebrate

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,480
and recognize some of the good work

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,610
being done in this space I really

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,800
appreciate it and the thing that I think

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,720
is really interesting about the

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,210
nominations and the acceptance is is

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,010
that they all seemed to be team efforts

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,680
even when it is an individual really

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,990
pushing really hard these it and and

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,090
that is very true about defense it's

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,540
really a team sport and it's a game that

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:33,520
we have to play together

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,520
