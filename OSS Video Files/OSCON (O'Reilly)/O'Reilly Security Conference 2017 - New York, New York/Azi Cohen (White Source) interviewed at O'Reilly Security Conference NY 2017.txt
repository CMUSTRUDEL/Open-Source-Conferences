hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,670
security in New York I'm here with the Z

00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:08,459
from white source right so that's right

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,410
so unpack white source I mean it sounds

00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:13,769
like white something and then source

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,929
source exactly so we basically look at

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,000
the open source code that is out there

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,680
as you can imagine not everything is at

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,160
the quality or the security that fit

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,860
enterprises or companies that use open

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,930
source so we help them to white listo

00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,940
find the jewels out of the rough and

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,460
find the ones that are secured high

00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,289
quality can be maintained etcetera so

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,260
that's how the name came up so if an

00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:39,510
enterprise builds a piece of software

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,140
right and they've taken different parts

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,210
of open source projects and put them in

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,850
is that what you're helping them we help

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,969
them to pick the right pieces aprende

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,159
and you know if someone did mistake you

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,589
know so we can apply policies and

00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,019
actually prevent from the good bad stuff

00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,449
to get into your account but an easy no

00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:02,670
code is things that keep on changing so

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,290
if sunny there is a vulnerability you

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,360
know there's a way for us to provide the

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,759
alert you know think of Equifax is a

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,070
good example right an open source

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,960
vulnerability exploited knowing you or

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,939
no one fix it on time so this is exactly

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
the things that we are doing and do you

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,320
feed when you when you find these

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,149
exploits or these holes or backdoors or

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,369
whatever you're finding do you feed that

00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:25,469
back to the open source project or so so

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,110
no we actually consume the data that the

00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:31,500
community provide us ok so the community

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,390
are the ones that suddenly find you know

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,759
in your vulnerability in a piece of

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,229
software right so we make sure that this

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,689
is this information is immediately

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,609
accessible to all our clients that are

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,340
using this specific one so we do not

00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,259
create we don't identify our own

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,390
vulnerabilities we just let them know

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,670
which are the pieces that are currently

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,350
vulnerable and maybe even a fix out

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,590
there so in a way it's kind of like a

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,140
clearinghouse you pass through you you

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,869
know it's gonna be good you know

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,999
obviously we do a little bit more you

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,539
know because we allow the culprits to

00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,920
put a lot of policies on top all right

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,659
but you may say Clearing House you know

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,119
it's its new definition never heard of

00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,129
something like

00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,580
that this time being used but it could

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:16,390
be one also like a whitelist I mean I

00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,519
hear well I understand what you're

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,110
coming where the name came from so when

00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,659
you're working with enterprises and

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,610
they've got a mix of open source and

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,709
proprietary and all that are there

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,890
common things that you're hearing from

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:33,549
customers that they're having problems

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:36,370
absolutely so you know if you loo if you

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:40,810
go back to three years all right the

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,370
only way for corporate IT to find you

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,260
know even the inventory of open source

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,489
was by scanning the code you know go

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,230
back to the stuff that he's already

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,060
written and distributed check the code

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,730
and find what's there that's too late

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,430
and this approach was fitting fitted

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,500
when when use people used to end rows

00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,269
three five ten components today there

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,040
are hundreds today Gartner says at

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,920
eighty percent of the new code include

00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,609
open source right so you know that's not

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,950
enough so so enterprise the challenges

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:11,260
for enterprise is to find a way to stop

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,370
open source from getting in at the gate

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,700
they call it shift left ok as left as

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,010
you can go in in the waterfall right so

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,500
they really want to make sure that you

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,200
know they they identify that an open

00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,180
source piece will not click in at the

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,769
moment that the developer is going out

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,750
searching for threes browser that cetera

00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:37,329
and this is this is exactly what we

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,579
pitch to them we're one of the few that

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,169
actually allow the developers why they

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,419
are looking surfing in the internet

00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,030
directly from the browser to pick

00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:47,709
something on the spot see if it's good

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,690
enough it is vulnerabilities whether

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,190
someone else is already using it in the

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,720
course we provide that all that

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,489
information is provided at the point

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,239
where decision is made by the developers

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,459
and that's huge cost saving because if

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
you can stop it there rather than here

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:05,319
right right and and and this is the

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,480
change at 90 percent of the corporates

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,769
are looking so stop it upfront yes you

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,510
don't have that whole development team

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,060
and then the second piece that they're

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,370
really care about is identifying new

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,229
vulnerabilities as they find as they

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,530
come up and fix them for quickly with

00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:21,969
the next patch right knowing what are

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,270
the changes in the inventory that they

00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:25,690
are

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,580
have being able to react fast and shot

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,099
it you know that's the next big thing

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,020
for them because right now in order to

00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,330
get understand where the vulnerabilities

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,699
are they really have to go to multiple

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,830
data resources not all of them are

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:41,259
accurate none of them are reacting home

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,940
time we aggregate all that information

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,789
for them and once there is a new

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,440
vulnerability boom we let them know when

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,819
there's a fix we let them well so

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,190
without giving away your secret sauce

00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:53,139
how do you guys figure this out oh it's

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,759
a great story you know the three of us

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,009
the three founders of the company myself

00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,080
as he wronged me more who is the

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,490
chairman and Romney who was the CEO we

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,020
were three partners in a previous

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,490
company that was sold to CA Technologies

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,919
2007 and on the last night before

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,050
signing we were still clearing

00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:12,970
open-source components they were just

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,580
scanning our code finding more stuff and

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:18,340
more stuff and sending that to us asking

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,469
us to clear that and you know we signed

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,610
a deal and we talked to three of us talk

00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:23,110
he said you know we have to bring

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,430
something different to the table you

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,219
know that doesn't make sense

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,069
it took us a year or so to figure out

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:33,639
what will be the right approach and the

00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:37,690
rest is history so are you a CA company

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:40,569
no no no I'm saying we the idea came

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,659
from a previous company okay both three

00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:46,449
of us initiated install to ca okay and

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:48,699
on the last day of the signing the

00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:51,069
acquisition documents this is when the

00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:53,110
idea came up and now the three of us are

00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:54,669
starting this nucleus started this

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,680
company so what would the three of you

00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,050
like to see happen in 12 months from now

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,849
let's say you know because 12 months is

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,590
quite a while right I mean three months

00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,900
is a long time in interest industry so

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,099
in 12 months where would you like to see

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,729
white source and what would you like to

00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:13,389
be doing differently right now we focus

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:17,349
on growth we triple our revenues number

00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:19,810
of clients you know year-over-year you

00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,930
know we raise money

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,270
Microsoft is an investor in the company

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,449
what we do right now is make sure that

00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,990
we build a company to continue grow at

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,240
that same rate

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,520
you know I was a little bit outside the

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,140
company for the first few years because

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm based in New York the rest are in

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,820
Israel now that the business start to

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,280
grow I took the responsibility to run

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,410
the America operation so I'm the GM for

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,880
North America so our goal is to make

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:50,390
sure that we'll continue growing at the

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,070
rate of 3x year-over-year expand or you

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:55,040
know make sure that our brand is all

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,560
over you know actually we get good

00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,020
reviews from you know for some of the

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,890
analysts like foresters etc that would

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,240
put us quite in the top of this pack so

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,070
expanding making sure that brand is

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,840
being known that's our goal for the

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,150
coming 12 months and what do you see

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,490
happening in the industry because so if

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:17,210
open source and software are eating the

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:19,850
world and if 80% of software is going to

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,070
have open source in it and and software

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:25,960
is eating the world where do you see

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:30,410
security in that that relationship it's

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:33,530
it's it's it's going to be one of the

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:36,530
prime selection criteria for open source

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:40,040
it's it's there's no question about it

00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:43,190
you know it's it's it's so expensive you

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:47,180
know to get something even in the middle

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:50,240
right so being able to identify the good

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,980
stuff out of the wrist and and provide

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,620
some guidelines you know about the

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,440
quality of the developers right today

00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,180
release patches very quickly after stuff

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,430
like that comes in the overall quality

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,390
that's going to be extremely important

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,310
today clients still majority of the

00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,620
clients are still at this stage were
