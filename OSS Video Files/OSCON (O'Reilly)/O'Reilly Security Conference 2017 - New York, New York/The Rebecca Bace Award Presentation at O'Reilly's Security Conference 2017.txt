one of the wonderful things about going

00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:11,760
to security events like this is the

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,910
chance to meet and become friends with

00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,160
your heroes and with role models and it

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,050
makes it really difficult than when you

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,439
lose someone who's very special to you

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,980
and to the community that said Rebecca

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,019
bass who is a good friend and a

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,560
wonderful role model for the industry

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,350
and a pioneer I feel like the best way

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,580
to celebrate someone with that much

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,310
vision that much passion energy smarts

00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,510
an ability to push things forward is

00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,670
actually to continue to be inspired by

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,950
what she brought to the table and so it

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,580
is with that spirit that we were

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,940
considering who we would celebrate go at

00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:00,030
this year in 2017 as the first recipient

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,810
of the Rebecca bass Pioneer Award now we

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,979
had a lot of nominees and they were all

00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:07,520
spectacular so I think we should feel

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,560
good as an industry and as a community

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,270
both that we have so many people who

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:20,490
inspire and that our peers recognize our

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,539
great work that said our selection for

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,270
the 2017

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,950
Rebecca bass Pioneer Award I'm very

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,899
happy to announce and are you ready to

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,670
get your camera phones out get ready to

00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:33,319
clap because I really want to hear like

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,820
cheering because this is Rebecca our

00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:54,520
2017 recipient is Katie Moo Saurus

00:01:37,820 --> 00:02:00,200
[Applause]

00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:04,100
Wow thanks so much I deliberately didn't

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,940
wear mascara because Becky was so

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,890
important to so many of us have having

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,710
her name on a piece of paper and my name

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:16,930
on a piece of paper is more than I can

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:22,880
even well I didn't wear mascara okay so

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:24,470
look um I never know why people invite

00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,850
me to these things I mean maybe it's the

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,510
pink hair but I've only had it for like

00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:31,250
a year so it it's something else and to

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,930
be recognized by your peers like this is

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,540
is more than I could have expected and

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,959
especially with an award that has

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:51,140
Becky's name on it so thank you thank

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:53,000
you so much I think it's time to

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,310
actually think about this I'm not saying

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,280
that this is a win size fits all realm

00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,200
however the hazard is first off my

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,090
assessment is that I believe that

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,150
timewise we're looking at scenarios

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,060
where if we don't have a hand in it it's

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,910
going to get done for us and believe me

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,739
I've done I've seen this go go down I've

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,390
seen the whole legislative cycle goes

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,180
down the one thing about the law is that

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:21,470
it takes forever to do however what's

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,239
done it is almost impossible to undo so

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,060
I think that there is a professional

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,400
interest for this particular group to

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,410
have a hand and have a voice and what

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,030
comes out in this realm and if we're in

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,350
a position where we're proactive in

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,260
saying this is the way we ought to go

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,720
around about this our chances of

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,370
actually being heard and having

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,450
something and we've met within which we

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,450
