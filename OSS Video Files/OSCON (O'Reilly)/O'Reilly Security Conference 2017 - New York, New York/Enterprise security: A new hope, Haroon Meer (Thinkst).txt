Description: 
	The frequency and impact of recent high-profile breaches has been positively depressing. Besides the increasing number of incidents themselves, there’s been a growing phalanx of security vendors clamoring to sell us stuff (we don’t need) and promising to solve our problems (while sometimes making them worse). It’s a security nihilist’s dream, and despair seems like a reasonable option.

However, a new type of security engineering is taking root, which suggests hope for effective corporate security at enterprise scale. Haroon Meer highlights these hopeful examples in a bid to encourage more people to plot a course toward achievable security.
