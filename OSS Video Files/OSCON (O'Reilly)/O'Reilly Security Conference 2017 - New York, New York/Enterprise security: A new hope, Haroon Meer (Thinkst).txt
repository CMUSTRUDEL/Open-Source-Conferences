Title: Enterprise security: A new hope, Haroon Meer (Thinkst)
Publication date: 2017-10-31
Playlist: O'Reilly Security Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	The frequency and impact of recent high-profile breaches has been positively depressing. Besides the increasing number of incidents themselves, there’s been a growing phalanx of security vendors clamoring to sell us stuff (we don’t need) and promising to solve our problems (while sometimes making them worse). It’s a security nihilist’s dream, and despair seems like a reasonable option.

However, a new type of security engineering is taking root, which suggests hope for effective corporate security at enterprise scale. Haroon Meer highlights these hopeful examples in a bid to encourage more people to plot a course toward achievable security.

	00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,820
so every topic or every talk needs a

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,610
starting hypothesis and mine is gonna be

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:16,660
pretty simple it's gonna be that

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,430
corporate or enterprise security sucks

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,220
okay and some of us have been saying

00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,949
this for a while but for a really really

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,750
long time um lots of people were living

00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:32,119
in denial okay because and and it's a

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:36,230
really strange thing I'm full of puns

00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:38,420
like full of bad fantasies um it's an

00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:41,719
interesting thing because the signs were

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,329
all around us but but lots of people are

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,890
still refused to believe and it may have

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,850
been difficult to believe

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:53,000
back in 2010 but these days it's a lot

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,070
easier to believe okay because um if you

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,780
look around you should see that even

00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,550
though you've got all these mega cops

00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,449
that have been spending Bigley on

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,030
security almost nobody's been able to to

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,100
get anything right and and then what was

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,619
left was not just for the security teams

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,159
but for the offensive security teams to

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:16,159
feel a little smug okay because um the

00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,560
thinking was that you know what we do is

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,869
we'd go around and we'd tell people what

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,049
they should be doing and point out how

00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:26,750
they should be protecting themselves and

00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:28,700
one of the unspoken truths um that that

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,130
people have started to realize is that

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,100
if you on the red team for the most part

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,909
your jobs just a whole lot easier

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,490
okay the bow was so low that red team is

00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:43,159
for really long time started thinking we

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,049
were geniuses right every pen test that

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,719
we did worked every social engineering

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,020
exercise that we did work and if only

00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,020
those defenders would do their jobs as

00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,030
well as we were doing our jobs

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,799
everything would be fixed okay but but

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,770
the honest thing is that the odds were

00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:04,219
incredibly stacked in our favor and and

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,680
probably the best articulation of this

00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:08,509
came from Dan Gere who pointed out that

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,789
that we all run around doing the

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,970
security stuff when for the most part

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:16,720
we're just hoping that the attacks don't

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,670
happen on our watch okay and

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,390
I guess for that the honest truth is

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,480
that hope shouldn't be a strategy if I'm

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:29,470
quoting dan gear I've got a quote Brian

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,380
snow and Brian snow gave this talk many

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:35,350
years back at a conference in Malta and

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,810
and he had this excellent quote which

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,540
which said something like your cyber

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,870
systems continue to function and serve

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:46,120
you not due to the skills of your

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,450
security staff but due to the sufferance

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,610
of your opponents and I think Brian snow

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,200
was a little early for that sort of

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,590
thing like we weren't ready to hear the

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,980
message kind of like Marcus Ranum was in

00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:02,500
many ways but but what's interesting is

00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,620
since they made these statements things

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:09,160
have only actually gotten worse because

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,880
if you consider it for years and years

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,180
we suffered trying to secure a computer

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,540
okay and nowadays even your computer is

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,550
multiple computers okay and and the

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,070
obvious example that I'm giving there is

00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,890
for those of you with a shiny Mac with a

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,380
fancy touch bar you should know that

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:32,080
your touch by is effectively like watch

00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,130
us so it's a whole new off Spurr but

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,070
running on your computer

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,410
um but but it's more than jesters right

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,260
your hard drives have processes now or

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,660
almost everywhere you look their

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,519
processes and one of the examples that I

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,370
like quoting I'm not sure how many if

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,650
you saw this example but at some point a

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,840
little Mac independent software

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,430
development company we're trying to

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,540
figure out why they were getting MPEG

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,769
artifacts when using the DVI adapter and

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,730
essentially they cut up the DVI adapter

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:08,019
and found inside an ARM processor and

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:11,590
two gigs of ram okay so your DVI adapter

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:13,660
is actually a computer also okay and and

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,180
that stuff just gets worse and worse um

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:19,299
Alex and Eskew pointed out that every

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,840
modern monitor is an x86 computer bunyan

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:25,120
sobs pointed out that $0.20 SD cards

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,270
have processes running on them that can

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,460
be back doored and subverted okay so we

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,590
had trouble when we just had one come

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,210
pewter and now everywhere we look

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:38,440
there's a computer and we're not exactly

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,449
scaling up in terms of the number of

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,900
people we add to defend against this

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,900
problem

00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,650
