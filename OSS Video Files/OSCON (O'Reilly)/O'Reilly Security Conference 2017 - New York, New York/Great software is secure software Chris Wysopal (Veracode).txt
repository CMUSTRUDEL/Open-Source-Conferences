Title: Great software is secure software Chris Wysopal (Veracode)
Publication date: 2017-10-31
Playlist: O'Reilly Security Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	If great software is secure software, why are there still so many vulnerabilities? Donâ€™t architects and developers want to build great systems? Software teams today must move fast to compete in the marketplace. They need to inherit functionality, scale, and performance. Can they inherit security as well?

As defenders it is our job to make this inheritance possible. Ideally security inheritance is transparent and inescapable. Chris Wysopal details how defenders can enable developers to create secure software through coaching, shared code, and services.

Builders need to own the means of

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,889
securing their product they need to have

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,590
ownership they need to have

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,800
responsibility for this no longer can

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,830
see security be the province of the

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:23,220
security elite we can't police security

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,100
in with checkpoints and central control

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,850
that doesn't work anymore we can't be

00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:32,669
the people that's say no right if you

00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:34,649
think about it the business is trying to

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,589
build value they're trying to put

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,089
something out into production and

00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:40,710
they're they want to change all the

00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,589
things they want to change things make

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,079
things go fast and the security team is

00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:49,229
a lot of times thought as the voice of

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,809
no and it comes from deep down inside if

00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,629
you build new systems or you change

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,690
things you're adding risk and we know

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,600
that so let's slow that down let's think

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,100
about it you know it's easier to not do

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,229
something than to do something from the

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,000
security perspective if we just keep

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,990
everything the same we feel like we have

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,360
a secure environment we're doing our job

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:15,510
the problem is that destroys value

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,680
there's this great line from from the

00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:22,770
agile manifesto people that code that is

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,240
not in production has no value and this

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,850
was one of the central tenets of the

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,610
whole agile methodology was to get that

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,920
code into production faster right

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,800
getting into production faster increases

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,560
value so this is why agile and DevOps

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,940
has value and anything we do to slow

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,490
that down we're actually destroying

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,070
value this we're just like we're costing

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,670
the business money by slowing them down

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,790
so that doesn't work we need security

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,650
teams that can enable we can't do it we

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,290
can't do the security that the

00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,690
development teams have to do it

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,060
themselves they need ownership and

00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,430
responsibility they can't be doing a

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,190
handoff to another team and having us do

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:10,800
the security stuff if we do the testing

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,110
if we do the threat modeling if we do

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,510
the scanning the developers think of

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,410
security as someone else's problem it's

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,860
not my problem

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,900
this

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,700
curity people are doing in the security

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,890
people are doing it and it's someone

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,240
else's problem it's not my problem so

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,970
that doesn't work

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,980
the security team has to enable the

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,290
developers to do security themselves

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,660
they need ownership the notion of

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,350
auditing from an outside group just

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,350
doesn't work anymore

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,959
