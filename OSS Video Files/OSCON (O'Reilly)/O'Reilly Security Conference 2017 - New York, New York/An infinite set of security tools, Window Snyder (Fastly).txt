Publication date: 2017-11-01
Playlist: O'Reilly Security Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	You can spend your entire security budget on signal-based technologies (such as endpoint security, antimalware, and vulnerability detection) and incrementally improve the security of your environment. But the real value is in people. Join Window Snyder to learn why the basics are hard to implement consistently but will get you a lot further than yet another set of signal-based tools.
