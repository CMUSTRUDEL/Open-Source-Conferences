Title: An infinite set of security tools, Window Snyder (Fastly)
Publication date: 2017-11-01
Playlist: O'Reilly Security Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	You can spend your entire security budget on signal-based technologies (such as endpoint security, antimalware, and vulnerability detection) and incrementally improve the security of your environment. But the real value is in people. Join Window Snyder to learn why the basics are hard to implement consistently but will get you a lot further than yet another set of signal-based tools.

some security work still requires people

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:12,390
the things that add value in measurable

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:15,030
ways very often require people and can't

00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,949
easily be replaced by tools although

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,220
they're definitely an infinite number of

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,619
product companies out there trying

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,429
developers can evaluate whether or not

00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,310
older code still meets your business

00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,259
needs or if it's just adding risk when

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,279
they prune old code the potential

00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:31,380
vulnerabilities in that code are a

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,030
hundred percent mitigated it's not there

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,350
anymore so if their vulnerabilities

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,329
they're not going to impact your

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,219
business if they rewrite it in

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,629
higher-level languages the risk of

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,719
memory corruption vulnerabilities is

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,140
dramatically reduced if they centralized

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,539
input validation reach ability is

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,199
reduced for exploits so all this work

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,219
that they do result in a very clear

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,329
tangible benefit to the organization

00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,499
security engineers can look at the

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,050
network and identify ways to

00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:02,879
compartmentalize sensitive systems or

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,030
restrict channels to reduce attack

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,280
surface or eliminate risk from systems

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,930
legacy systems for example that are that

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,050
are harder to maintain in a lot of

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,700
organizations the limitation on security

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,790
updates getting security updates out

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,410
quickly is that the security testing is

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,090
so expensive because you need to be able

00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,390
to evaluate the impact across the

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,580
organization on a large number of

00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,440
environments if you're able to have

00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,670
confidence in an update that's not going

00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,350
to break everything if you roll it out

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,450
you're able to roll it out more quickly

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,210
which limits the window of opportunity

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,610
for an attacker to exploit a recently

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:43,890
identified vulnerability so things like

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,440
increasing your organization's ability

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,690
to respond quickly to new

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,610
vulnerabilities or new patches that's

00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,580
something that dramatically reduces your

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,190
risk and a lot of this stuff is core

00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,710
security basics but it's also the set of

00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,450
things most inconsistently applied we

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:06,150
know what to do but we're not great as

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:07,950
an industry at consistent execution the

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,349
return on these investments can easily

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,900
be measured that code is not in

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,450
production that system can only be

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,230
accessed by this small set that require

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,470
access

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,690
our threat model documents our areas of

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,580
greatest risk and our mitigations are

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,280
evaluated against specific pests

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,140
our time to patch is now 50% of our

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,180
previous time to patch these are all

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,269
things that are easy to measure that

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,800
have a huge impact on your

00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:37,849
organization's security and are not

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,849
implemented by tools

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,810
