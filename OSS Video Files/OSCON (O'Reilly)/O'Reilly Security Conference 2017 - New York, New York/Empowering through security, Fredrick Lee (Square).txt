Title: Empowering through security, Fredrick Lee (Square)
Publication date: 2017-10-31
Playlist: O'Reilly Security Conference 2017 - New York, New York
Description: 
	Information security multiplies what we can do in the digital world. Traditionally we security professionals have been viewed as gate keepers, rule enforcers, and the people who say “no.” Even our language and iconography reflect this, using locks as symbols of what we do, phrases like “lock it down” to describe how we do our jobs, and terms such as “firewalls” to describe how we do it. However, when viewed optimistically, security can also unlock opportunities. Our profession needs to reach beyond being gatekeepers and move toward being gate openers.

Square prides itself on “finding yes” and leveraging security to open doors of access to enable economic empowerment for the world. There are many examples of how security has granted access. Fredrick Lee shines a light on the ways security has allowed the world to do more and encourages security professionals to solve the difficult problems to allow us all to say “yes.” As security practitioners, we must all seek to be force multipliers.

	00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,310
so I want to bring us back to common

00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,930
ground I'll talk about a topic I'm

00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,910
pretty sure we can all identify with

00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:15,349
this is one of my personal favorite

00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:17,509
topics I like money I'm not being paid

00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,090
to speak today but in my normal

00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:21,770
day-to-day life I do get paid I'm a big

00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,730
fan of getting paid I'm also a big fan

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,919
of other people getting paid you know at

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,020
square we think deeply about this notion

00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:33,020
about economic empowerment and allowing

00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,670
more people that maybe previously could

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,289
not participate in the economy to get

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:38,390
paid within the economy to actually

00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:40,429
participate that to be what I ki have

00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,980
commerce and opportunities that they

00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,120
could not previously oftentimes you'll

00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,190
find these like you know small

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,679
individual you know entrepreneurs who

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:51,230
are fairly new to Commerce in some cases

00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:53,989
and they share something in common with

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,629
me I hate having my money stolen

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:59,629
I hate also seeing other people have

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,339
their money stolen and so you know I go

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,499
back to some of the things that we think

00:01:01,339 --> 00:01:05,180
about when it you know comes to actually

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:07,369
making commerce work and those small

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,170
business owners you know the person

00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,500
who's you know just starting up a bodega

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,750
on a corner shop or you know maybe that

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,130
you know one you know crazy hippie

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,950
friend of yours it's odd to me to be

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,500
selling beads on the sidewalk etc how do

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,670
you actually allow them to do the common

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,969
things we think of when it comes to

00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,030
Commerce often we actually go into a

00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:30,680
store this is your interaction with the

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,299
person who's at the you know the front

00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,979
counter you think about that coffee shop

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,079
right like what are the things that a

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:38,180
person inside of a coffee shop has to

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,979
think about and then take a step back

00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,969
what are the things that a person in the

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,750
coffee shop should be thinking about

00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,189
we've already seen a couple of

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,430
presentations where we've already had

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,280
kind of like the logos of shame you know

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:54,590
you see your targets you know you see

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,259
obviously zfo facts you know you see all

00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:00,590
these things etc privacy sonic drive-in

00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,939
all these places and oftentimes you know

00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,429
it's some kind of breach some kind of

00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,229
compromise all these things that at the

00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,670
end of the day was not their core

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,440
business which is actually being

00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,480
security company security aware of

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,490
security conscious and instead their

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,800
core business was actually selling you

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,430
you know random stuff from Target

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,980
selling

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,200
you a really unhealthy cheeseburger from

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,510
Sonic all these other kind of things and

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,739
and I really you know that resonates

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,170
with me cuz I think about the person

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,180
running a coffee shop so I seen lots of

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,150
coffee cups here so I know we have a lot

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,769
of coffee drinkers and so you know we go

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,329
to these coffee shops it's a really

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,590
common thing especially in the Bay Area

00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:38,389
because rent is expensive you have

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,340
really small houses you go to the coffee

00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:42,500
shop that's your second office and you

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,510
hop on that coffee shop Wi-Fi you're

00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,540
hopping on that coffee shop Wi-Fi also

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,909
with this same point-of-sale system how

00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,709
many of you know of baristas that know

00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:56,900
anything about VLANs Network

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:58,939
segmentation patching etc however we

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,260
give them tools that require them to

00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:06,109
know that when they get popped not if

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,200
when they get popped we start pointing

00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:11,329
fingers at them we blame the barista we

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,069
blame the coffee shop owner who have to

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,750
end of the day their goal is to sell you

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,939
coffee their goal is to sell you

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,280
delicious coffee get money from you

00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,260
obviously and hopefully get repeat

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,919
business from me their goal is not to be

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,709
a security expert at square we decided

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,750
we don't want to blame those people we

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,510
want to give people the tools that they

00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:35,060
need to actually do the job that they're

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,260
doing our job is the job actually having

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,090
secure devices our job is about making

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,419
you know infrastructure and security and

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,819
software that actually meets those users

00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,250
where they are if you're a coffee shop

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:53,030
owner and you want to take credit cards

00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,439
you can just buy a square reader you can

00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,269
get you know the little mag stripe

00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,680
readers for free and if you just saw a

00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,939
big announcement yesterday you can even

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,549
get one of the more you know fancier

00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:03,259
displays at the end of the day though

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,569
you don't have to actually think about

00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,609
security you don't know have to know

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,040
anything about cert pinning you don't

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:12,379
know I have to know anything about TLS

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,479
you don't have to know anything about

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,729
just general patching and those kind of

00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:20,359
things you just have to think about and

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:22,610
focus on making delicious hipster coffee

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,400
so those obnoxious san francisco's will

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,750
come back to your shop again right those

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,760
are the things and those are the things

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,190
that you should be thinking of as a

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,800
coffee shop owner

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,920
making coffee your goal is to make

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,660
coffee your need is to have secure

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,350
infrastructure to actually facilitate

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,350
that

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,810
