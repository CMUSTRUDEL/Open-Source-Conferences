hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,530
security in New York I'm here with

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,480
Prakash from Vera

00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,969
Prakash how you doing doing great Mike

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,440
so how was this event been for you so

00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:12,089
far

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,639
even has been wonderful and attended

00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,130
some of the booth sessions and so I've

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,500
seen some demos at some old friends

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,200
looking forward to some of the sessions

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,810
and there expires and I'll be speaking

00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:30,060
tomorrow at 11:20 and it's what are you

00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,680
speaking on I'm speaking about how data

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,929
in the enterprise has changed over time

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,129
and how there's new threats now and how

00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:40,949
prior solutions aren't building a

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,159
perimeter don't work anymore so and then

00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:46,339
we talk about a new approach to security

00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,980
data centric approach to security so

00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:52,289
that is a lot more appropriate in this

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,539
world where data is everywhere in a

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,670
world where there's no border surely

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,429
so if data is gonna help us with

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,859
security what are the new threats that

00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,049
that that we're gonna attack with this

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,369
data at centric approach what are some

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:10,140
of the new threats you're seen to an

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:11,700
enterprise so a but and then the past

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,439
year and I believe it not there were

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,930
four hundred and fifty billion dollars

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,689
lost in value from all these data

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,810
breaches and the number is estimated to

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,729
create about two trillion four hundred

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,840
fifty billion billion billion and that's

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:31,789
growing to two trillion by 2020 right so

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,670
there's and there's threats started

00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:37,799
primarily from honest users doing stupid

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,759
things like that 60% of the data

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,250
breaches right

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,079
and we're fat triggering email right

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,439
which all of us have done at some point

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,149
right

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,909
so all these users doing stupid things

00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,969
is that large enterprises doing stupid

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,259
things too so that's another aspect of

00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,600
it as well right so that's where we need

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,640
to talk about delight and for the email

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,030
leak right so data breaches around

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,999
communications is a big part of it right

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:05,880
in that case the admin passwords were

00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,740
compromised giving the attackers blanket

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,099
access to email and all the corporate IP

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,520
within that system right another good

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,410
example

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,260
when enterprises collaborate with

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:18,910
contractors and sometimes these are in a

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,800
different country so enterprises are

00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,480
realizing that doesn't matter how many

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,340
millions of dollars they spend on their

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,970
infrastructure the weakest link is

00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,340
somewhere else

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,850
it's the contractors some examples of

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,400
breaches there are snowed in NSA back in

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:37,060
the day more recent one is the rise in

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,280
hack we do use a third party not

00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,810
handling their data well about 14

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,900
million user accounts got compromised

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,450
it's also some pretty evolving attacks

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,490
on ransomware right where initially they

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,930
were focused on encrypting data getting

00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,000
some bitcoins but now they're getting

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,090
smarter and the ransomware is more

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,880
focused on infiltrating data because

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:00,100
that's where the real value is right and

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,950
there's one malware recently lucky

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,320
bought Android where they're extract

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,420
rating data and when someone tries to

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,010
remove that then it becomes an somewhere

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,980
and that's when they demand Bitcoin

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,040
straight so it's a malware is evolving

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,170
right and but at the same time the

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,900
threats are also evolving primarily

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:22,240
because the baby of collaborate with

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,520
data is changing over time so what do

00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,640
you guys are very doing to help mitigate

00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,640
all this like if if data is gonna help

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,130
solve our breaches and threats and

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,050
attacks in the future what are you guys

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,440
doing specifically to help with that at

00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,290
Vera yeah so we it better be we have a

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,330
data centric approach to securing

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,760
information so that the security and

00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:48,040
control travels with the data wherever

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,770
it goes right so it doesn't matter what

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,930
device what platform with network or how

00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,840
you're going about accident data so we

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,490
provide that strong security coupled

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,480
with an invisible experience for the

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:03,370
good guys so then then what this the

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,620
problem then becomes why not secure all

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,959
your information where you know that

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,120
your data is protected everywhere not

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,670
all times so how does someone get

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,410
started with with you guys I mean to me

00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,590
when you say a third party that could be

00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:19,600
part of the problem if you're a third

00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,060
party to the equation how do you make

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,750
sure that that whatever someone works

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,740
with is secure so that's what made it

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,259
provides we provide

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,419
the data-centric security solution

00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,460
that's easy for anyone to transact with

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:36,220
if they've never heard where they

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,930
receive a secure file particular with

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,349
weather or a secure email protected with

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,300
weather

00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,490
they can very simply authenticate and

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,120
get access to that information assuming

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,340
their trusted and even even better right

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,380
therefore the person that owns our

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,460
information so the data is strongly

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:57,610
encrypted at rest in motion and and and

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,770
in use right we we apply access control

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,960
on top which means that only trusted

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,960
users can truly access that content

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,409
right and and the best part is that we

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,780
enforce permissions the dynamic data or

00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:13,120
policies even when someone is accessing

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,940
that information so you can prevent

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,639
people from copying printing or

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,310
screenshotting information so you get

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,210
that strong security right and and yet

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,159
is simple for our genuine users honest

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,590
users trusted users to access that

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,849
information and you guys are making some

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,729
announcements this week here in our

00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:36,520
event yes we're excited about you know

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:39,520
announcing our secure email product line

00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,979
so this is in addition to where our for

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,190
files and the very platform so we're

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:48,190
leveraging the platform now to protect

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,409
email body and email attachments so the

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,270
idea is that I could send you Mike an

00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,520
email but secure only you could access

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,080
it right between you forward it along to

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,060
someone else they couldn't access it

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,669
forever I mean it's encrypted or

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,860
something so great you know we bid at

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,889
all times right and and I have the

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,870
ability to enforce permissioning I could

00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:09,759
provide a personalized watermark so if

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,630
you take a picture right it's it's it's

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,460
Mike's a copy of that email and but the

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,740
best part is you can do this without you

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,900
having to go through setting up public

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,150
private key pairs or any of that so very

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,639
simple experience works on any device

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,409
any platform any email client and

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,250
seamless for the receiver and the sender

00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:32,710
both that's correct and we do this with

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,060
or without emission so the the sender

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,490
doesn't have to think about am i

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,110
securing this email or not right and on

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,060
the receiving side rate your as long

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,120
you have access just appears in your

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,550
Outlook or in single paper button you

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,950
can open it and on the browser from your

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,510
webmail plan sounds like something that

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,520
could be very useful in today's world

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,160
when we see all these breaches with

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,980
emails and email servers and everything

00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,440
so you guys are making email safe for

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:03,410
everybody great if they use you great so

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,810
think of Outlook reco get that now truly

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,340
works it's not like you get a recall

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,370
email and makes you curious about what

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,260
the original email was now you know

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,910
whether someone has open this email or

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,910
not and you could with a click of a

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:20,030
button they woke access to that email

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,530
and in particular in any of these

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,720
breaches where there's a Sony breach

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,960
couple years ago an email or the

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,490
Deloitte reiterate so yeah you have

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,190
complete control and visibility around

00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:34,040
who has access to your information and

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,170
email right and and very easily revoke

00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,600
access or control access or change

00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,360
access dynamically in real time

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,220
excellent so if we were sitting to sit

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,250
down for caution twelve months from now

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,440
and have this conversation here in New

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:51,410
York next year what would you like to

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,390
say has changed with Vera and what you

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,430
guys are offering and doing and what

00:07:53,390 --> 00:08:00,230
would you like to see change in the

00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:02,690
industry in the world so just recently

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:06,050
we announced an enterprise-wide

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:09,710
deal with General Electric where they've

00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,660
deployed our product or two all across

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,360
all their business units to protect the

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:19,520
IP information of all kinds of

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,990
intellectual property and more so and

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,860
that's a huge milestone for us as a

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,450
company right now in the next year what

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,750
we want to do is to leverage the

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,180
platform's inbuilt right and not just

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,100
for files and not just for email that we

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,460
just talked about but for other data

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,470
types as well in addition to that in

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,970
addition to protecting information we

00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,210
also want to be looking at

00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,250
classification but the problem is if you

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,380
have let's say lots of data terabytes of

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,730
data you know most companies do not know

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,610
where their cents to information is

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,009
right and that's where you want to help

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,800
find that sensitive information and once

00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,779
they find it in an automated fashion

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,759
allow for you know tagging that

00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,920
information or maybe even protecting or

00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,319
securing that information right so so

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,740
that's what we're wanting to do which is

00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:11,209
provide the de facto data security

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,269
standard for the enterprise so not just

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:17,870
the G's of the world but enterprises

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:21,110
across different verticals and begin

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,899
small are using whether in in creative

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,399
ways to protect data in in various forms

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:29,149
across different workflow straight and

00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:31,160
so it and true to our mission want to

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,029
protect data everywhere and at all times

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,319
excellent

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:35,089
Prakash we'll look forward to that

00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:37,300
conversation thank you thank you so much

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,300
