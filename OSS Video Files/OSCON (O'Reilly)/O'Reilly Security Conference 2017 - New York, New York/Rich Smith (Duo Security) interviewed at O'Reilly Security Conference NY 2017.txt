hi this is Mike Hendrickson from

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,130
security in New York City I'm here with

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,280
rich from duo rich how're you doing

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,629
great great to be here so duo can you

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,259
unpack a little bit about what you guys

00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:14,999
do so dirty I guess the best-known

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,640
product that we have is two factor

00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:20,520
authentication products that are really

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,990
combines ease-of-use good good UX and

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,460
security which are two things that

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,130
people often feel are diametrically

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,500
opposed you'll hear a lot of times that

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,820
you can be secure or you can be usable

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,890
but you can't be both them we believe

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,719
that we came up with a fantastic

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,210
two-factor authentication solution that

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,489
was both and you know people enjoy to

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,920
use it much better than the hard tokens

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,109
that you have a pocket full off and yeah

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,159
I mean that's that's really the the core

00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,559
of the company and we've grown from

00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,559
there and really now about protecting

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,969
access to applications depending on on

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,789
both your devices that you're accessing

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,370
from and obviously the person is using

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,280
that device so is this for consumers or

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,739
is this for security professionals or

00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,890
enterprise IT departments or who is it

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,290
for so we I mean we service a range of

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,369
customers certainly b2b as I mean focus

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,439
so helping companies secure access to

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,289
their environments for their employees

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,680
so we have a huge SMB market obviously

00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:21,570
an enterprise market and you know we

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,070
really try and facilitate companies to

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,350
be able to roll out effective security

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,490
for their organizations and not for too

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,140
many roadblocks in the way of their

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,789
employees obviously their employees have

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,439
work to do they've got jobs that they

00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:32,759
want to get done and they want to be

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,520
secure but they don't want to be overly

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,750
inconvenienced and we try and allow the

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,359
company to strike that balance between

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,039
easy-to-use security that has a huge

00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,509
impact on their security posture are

00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,009
there any patterns and the types of

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,710
companies that come to you and say hey

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,750
we've been having a problem doing X or Y

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,369
or are there things that they're

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,409
challenged with that you see over and

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,159
over so I think secure access is a

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,929
relatively universal problem people want

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,729
to make sure that the people that are

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,229
accessing their applications and their

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,490
environment are the right people that

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,490
they're authorized to do so

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,700
and that really cuts across all all

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:11,370
industry verticals however we do have a

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,610
huge number of IDI use that really latch

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,780
onto our product

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,940
again I think through the ease of use

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,650
their student bodies you know they have

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,390
tens of thousands of students often and

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,760
they want to make sure that those

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,860
students accessing things securely but

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,570
they don't want to add a huge burden to

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,880
them so either use or a big part of our

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,290
business but I would say over over time

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,520
it's growing across all industry

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,410
verticals because it's a very common

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,120
problem and that that's shared by

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,980
everybody and is the two-step

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,610
authentication the two-factor

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,800
authentication is it's slowly now the

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:44,290
way people interact or the way they get

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,510
online or the way they receive an email

00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,370
or anything like that is there a

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,480
performance hit because of it it

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,250
shouldn't slow down I mean one of the

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,770
metrics that we that we do track is that

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,590
that kind of time it takes to completely

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,030
authentication so user name password

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,739
that can be very quick did you type that

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,640
any hit enter and then and then you look

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:07,270
you're in adding a second step does slow

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,410
down that that authentication stage but

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,120
we want to make that as quick and easy

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,830
as possible and again we believe in

00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,810
doing push allows that to happen very

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,019
quickly you can authorize the push

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,519
things from your watch if if that's

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,230
something that you have paired with your

00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,700
device so it should be as quick and

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,830
seamless as possible and we believe that

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,620
the technology that we have is is far

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,540
quicker than than a hard token far

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,360
quicker than waiting to receive an SMS

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,970
and ringing of putting the number yeah

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
also is is far less error-prone and

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,720
gives more context around the the

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,090
authentication requests that has coming

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,130
with with new technologies like on the

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,530
new MacBooks there's the fingerprinting

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,739
technology can you have that be part of

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:50,620
the two-step you you can so that

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,130
actually I I work into our labs which is

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,570
the research arm of device security and

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,000
questions like that are exactly the kind

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,700
of work that we do so experimenting and

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,920
prototyping out as new technology hits

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,810
the market how can we you know extant

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,100
our products and and you use the new

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,470
technologies which are becoming more

00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,590
pervasive to again ease the burden on

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,970
users now ideally you know the secure

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,340
thing to do should be the easiest thing

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:19,120
to do and as new technologies come out

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,729
from Apple from Intel part of my role on

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,650
the teams that I runs role is to

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:25,480
evaluate how can we take advantage of

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,040
these new technologies and

00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,800
too useful for the consumer to make

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,870
things even easier so yes in the lab

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,210
we've we've got some some prototypes

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,850
where your fingerprints are being used

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,340
and again that quickens up that and that

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:43,180
authentication process and people seem

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,080
to like using that method or retinas

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:50,730
like my s8 my Galaxy s8 I can

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,500
authenticate with my eyes and obviously

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,880
it depends on the camera round there are

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
definitely some some base technology

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,550
requirements so for example the new

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,950
iPhone 10 has face ID you know Apple

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,300
with the the authentication kit that

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:09,160
Apple makes available to developers to

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,140
build solutions it makes taking

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,760
advantage of that new technology very

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,800
very easy I'm in the same way that they

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,830
make the thumbprint recognition so you

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,960
think let me ask do you see more b2c

00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,760
people aware that they need better

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,940
security or do you see more be to be

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,830
aware they need security um our focus is

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,300
duo's definitely b2b that's that's been

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,760
where our focus has traditionally been

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,500
if we're taking a step back and looking

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,380
at the industry trends in general there

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,140
has definitely been a healthy adoption

00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,370
in b2c two factor authentication as well

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,810
and that's senior that's very

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,400
encouraging and I think it's a

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,560
combination of factors that have gone

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
into that general awareness that strong

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,760
authentication is a good thing and it's

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,040
one of those if you do nothing else and

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,990
able to a fame you've really kind of

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,780
gone further up the tree you know you're

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,270
a much harder target than if you just

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,130
had a single factor authentication and

00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,030
then some of the big players Google

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:05,890
Facebook Twitter really getting on board

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,770
and encouraging people to enable these

00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,110
technologies good awareness education

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,870
material from them and then new

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,030
standards like the u2f standard from

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,180
from the Fido Alliance industry adoption

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,880
of that meaning that you could have one

00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,430
key you bikies other ones that are very

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,710
common um we usually beacuse it to oh

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,410
you know we're big fans of them and you

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,870
know a lot of flexibility that they have

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,780
that one key

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,970
- the u2f token and then you can use

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,060
that for your Facebook for Twitter and

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,800
this right that's right and you know

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,479
that one key can can help you secure

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,190
authentication to everything again it's

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,380
a you know it's a great usability

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,850
experience and you just touch it and

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,400
then and then you know you can

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,139
authenticate it's got very good security

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,790
and privacy properties so this

00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,889
integrates with Europe yes your

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,300
technology yes well so you know we're

00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,610
great friends with the you became people

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,699
we know we love there and you know we we

00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,139
love that tokens internal you do we we

00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,430
use those tokens we you know we

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,650
definitely buy into the the security

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,450
that those tokens can add but um yeah

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:16,110
you bikies can be integrated into the

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:18,419
duo services so if your users like that

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,900
form factor of authentication we like

00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:23,970
you to work in particular Danielle build

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,070
that in and you know that can be there

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,150
can be a different modality of

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,160
authentication this is like having a

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:31,800
little fun thing on the MacBook Pro

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,070
which is actually just slightly

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,860
different so the the you accuse and u2f

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,220
in general rook requires the step abuser

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:43,260
presents the this means that if your

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,030
system was was compromised it had been

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,880
been attacked through some other

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:51,270
vulnerability someone would not be able

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:53,430
to programmatically through software

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,840
complete that second factor

00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,210
authentication step you have to

00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,440
physically touch the bottom there's no

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,380
way that you can do that from software

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,849
so it's really just acknowledging that

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,800
the user presence which is different

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:07,110
than a biometric read or a fingerprint

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,910
which is making sure that you are the

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,889
person that is touching that that

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,599
fingerprint reader rather than there is

00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:13,830
a human that is touching this the second

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:16,440
factor device so they're solving

00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:19,229
slightly different problems but for you

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,380
to F use the presence is really is

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:26,099
really what the protocol is designed

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,780
around for you AF or web auth and that's

00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:31,020
really when you can start to extend a

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,719
lot of that protocol out into biometric

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,550
form factors as well and web or 10 is is

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,430
one of those standards that we see is

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,500
going to maybe 12 to 18 months really

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,979
start to be impacting the industry more

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,810
widely

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,800
are there are there some serious issues

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,589
on our

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,989
so if you and I sit down 12 months from

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,629
now and have a conversation again next

00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:54,509
year here and we talk about what's

00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:56,249
different for you guys at duo but also

00:08:54,509 --> 00:09:00,269
what's different in the market are we

00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:02,279
hurdling fast forward and a little

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,029
recklessly fast forward or are we in

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,040
good shape

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,449
what do you see so I think I mean I

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,249
would say that there's always going to

00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:11,369
be security challenges the way that that

00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:13,319
we think about or the research teams

00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:16,199
that do I think about security is it's a

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:17,819
pretty reactionary landscape so as

00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:19,139
technology evolves there's new great

00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:20,759
technologies coming out all the time

00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:24,029
obviously at pace and at an increasing

00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,350
pace the misuse of those technologies is

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:27,559
what we really want to be able to try

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,939
and predict and try and get out ahead of

00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:31,379
the the security landscape is always

00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,910
going to respond to that to that

00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:35,309
technology landscape however that's

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,629
going so we're definitely going forward

00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,959
fast but I mean that makes it an

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:42,959
exciting area to work in

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,660
absolutely and in terms of in 12 months

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,739
time we're in a world why can we be this

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,059
is gonna be one of those those

00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:49,619
interviews that you know you're gonna

00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:50,910
come come back and hold me because it's

00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:53,549
three months or three months so because

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,679
I'll be are we wrong but I you know I

00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:58,649
believe that strong authentication is is

00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,389
going to continue to be just a base

00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,499
level requirement almost eight table

00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:06,569
stakes passwords are a really poor way

00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:08,399
to authenticate individuals for a whole

00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:10,740
range of reasons when we've seen the

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,629
impacts that can come from weak

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,360
passwords or reusing passwords and

00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:19,799
two-factor really is a very simple way

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,929
that you can add extra extra protection

00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,939
into into that authentication process

00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:26,730
and I don't believe that's that's going

00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:27,990
to go away anytime soon so I think

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,869
that's going to become table stakes and

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:33,209
it's going to continue to commoditize

00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:35,610
the the areas that may be more

00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,199
innovative and more interesting things

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:40,259
that I would definitely encourage people

00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:42,779
to to kind of watch evolve over the next

00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,209
12 months will be things like Google's

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:46,860
beyond Corp initiative so this is where

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,169
they've essentially turned their

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,910
networks inside out all of their

00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:53,459
internal services are internet facing

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,769
and they have very very fine-grained

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,740
control in how you can access those

00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,080
services

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,940
from BYOD devices so it's not even a

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,440
device that maybe the company controls

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,600
itself and obviously that's a trend that

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,089
we're we're seeing increasingly

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,550
prevalent and so kind of a zero trust

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:11,230
networking beyond Corp I think that's

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,730
gonna become a paradigm that it is going

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,580
to become more more and more widely

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,860
adopted and that's in tandem with you

00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,170
know an increasing use of cloud services

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,060
and software as a service products which

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,360
are not going to go anywhere in 12

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,800
months time making sure that you're

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,180
securing access to those services even

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,520
when they're residing outside of your

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,080
corporate network it's really going to

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,130
be a trend that lots of people have to

00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,800
get on board and I think Google have

00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:38,070
done a great job with the the vision

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,380
that they painted out with beyond corp

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,430
duo beyond is a commercially available

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,430
implementation of the beyond called

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,980
models so makes it very easy to adopt a

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,450
very very security forward posture for

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,820
your company and really be ahead of the

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,680
curve in terms of how you're designing

00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,690
your network to be very cloud centric

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,820
this is how quickly that curve comes

00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,170
really yeah and maybe if I can predict

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,270
that I'll probably be a lot richer than

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,320
now at the moment yeah rich thank you

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,320
