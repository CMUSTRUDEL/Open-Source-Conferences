	00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,279
good morning everybody it's a real

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,099
pleasure to be here with you and today I

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,860
want to tell you about a field that is

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,870
emerging of what we call the physics of

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,849
AI and we're going to explore a bit de

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,619
intersection about what our new physics

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,500
that can help accelerate the future of

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,670
computing and the future of AI this is

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,650
where I work this is the research

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:27,060
headquarters of IBM it's about 45

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,260
minutes north of Manhattan so if you

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,789
look at I mean it'll be hard to

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,640
overstate the importance that

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,210
computation has had in the current you

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,000
know advances in AI and this is a road

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,149
map of what's likely to be in front of

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,090
us basically what we are seeing is that

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,280
we're seeing two and a half x

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:49,710
improvements per year in the performance

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,079
of the hardware that we can utilize say

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,780
to Train deep learning models and you

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,960
see in this plot two colors right you

00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,329
see these purple colors this is you know

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,070
what I would say is a GPU roadmap and

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:06,510
what you see in beyond the 2020

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,549
timeframe is displays where new physics

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,159
and new devices are gonna be required to

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,200
peek to keep this progress is that just

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,000
architectural innovations may not be

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,580
enough

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,530
now the roadmap to be able to do that it

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,420
starts with you know we have the current

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,390
paradigm of having accelerators like

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,310
GPUs beyond that you know that there is

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,110
a lot of emphasis around approximate

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,030
systems and approximate computing where

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,920
we can reduce the precision in the

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,049
architectures of these systems to be

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,790
able to do this efficiently you're

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,280
seeing a second row where we're now

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,820
talking about the introduction of novel

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,610
devices so you know things like analog

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,840
devices and you know and memory devices

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,850
that we bring very close to the

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,979
computing element to be able to achieve

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,829
forms of acceleration that we couldn't

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,680
do today but and while we're doing a lot

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,990
of work on that space I want to tell you

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,670
about the bottom row today I want to

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,460
tell you about the intersection of

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,909
quantum computing and AI and show you

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,250
some very recent results in this space

00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,840
we all know that there is an intimate

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,879
and very interesting relationship

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
between the dimensionality that we have

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,060
access

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
you know in our algorithms and neural

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,050
networks and our ability to do

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,170
classification to just give a trivial

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,880
example on the left hand side you see a

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,100
set of dots some are light you know

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,740
light blue dots and dark blue dots and

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,620
if I ask you to find a single line that

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,690
was able to classify or segment the dark

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,370
blue dots from the light blue dodge you

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,830
couldn't do it right you would have to

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,360
draw a circle or two lines but we know

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,000
that if you take that line and you just

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,730
simply curve it now it's easy to find

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,370
one line that classifies the dark dots

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,440
and the light dots so the generalization

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,930
of this principle is that we can have

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,340
many many many dimensions and what we do

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,270
in neural networks is we find a

00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,060
hyperplane that classifies two sets of

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,910
structures so think now of this concept

00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,470
that we as a community have gotten used

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,910
to the fact that we can do that with

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,190
neural networks right to do

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,500
classification and what I want to tell

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,720
you today is a different high

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,880
dimensional space that is going to be

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,290
accessible through quantum computers it

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,450
doesn't look exactly like neural

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,280
networks it's a different space but

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,190
we're going to explore today whether

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,459
this has power in doing classification

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:29,250
tasks now what is unique about this

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,550
quantum AI network is that it has a

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:36,239
special property and the dimensions

00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,540
inside of this quantum AI network would

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,690
be exponentially costly to model with a

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,690
classical computer so what is this

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,420
property this property is something

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,250
called quantum entanglement and that is

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,230
really the key resource that is

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,489
available to us in a quantum computer

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:59,880
that does not exist classically so what

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,250
is it if you go back to your physics

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,330
days and physics classes you remember

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,400
you learn something called the

00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,880
Heisenberg uncertainty principle and

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,040
simply stated what it says is that you

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,489
know we have learned that if we have a

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,669
particle we cannot know with arbitrary

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,560
precision both its position and its

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,539
speed it's really this momentum but it's

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,250
a speed right so if I know perfectly the

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,960
position I know nothing about its speed

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,800
and if I know perfectly its speed I know

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,780
nothing about its position

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,160
so consider the following thought

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,610
experiment to give you some

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,169
understanding of what is behind

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,300
entanglement so let's say we take two

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,979
particles and we entangle them we we

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,129
create this property that I'm trying to

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:44,590
describe and now what we do as a thought

00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:46,389
experiment is we separate them and we

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,169
send them to the two ends of the

00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,970
universe now what we're gonna do is

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:54,430
taking one of the particles an

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,979
experimenter is gonna go there and it's

00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,909
going to decide which aspect to measure

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:03,009
either its position or its speed now

00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:06,220
what is very fascinating what happens is

00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,900
that the moment we do that the act of

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,220
performing that measurement in one of

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,560
the particles that is one of the

00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,470
extremes of the universe it would mean

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,479
that we would instantaneously know

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,400
either the position or the speed of this

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
other particle that is on the other side

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,560
of the universe

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:27,610
now that is mind-blowing and one or two

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,710
things are going on either communication

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,979
across the ends of the universe is

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:37,240
faster than the speed of light we think

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,889
that that's very unlikely or a quantum

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,110
description of the world is much more

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:43,930
complex that everyday experience tells

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:48,659
us meaning we're violating a principle

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:52,630
of locality somehow we are sharing

00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:56,560
properties across vast distances in ways

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,259
that we cannot explain classically now

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,960
to mimic that property that we know

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:05,139
exists if we wanted to mimic that

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,870
classically with a normal computer it

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:10,300
would be exponentially costly how it

00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,800
costly let me give you an example if you

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,310
wanted to describe with our everyday

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,919
computers what take two qubits two

00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,840
quantum bits that are entangled that

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,759
have this special property and you say

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,069
well let me represent that classically

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,400
well if you just had two qubits it will

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:29,349
take you 512 bits you can see sort of

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,810
the list yeah by the time you have 35

00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:34,029
you can still do it 550 gigabytes but

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,180
it's an exponential by the time you have

00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:40,350
a hundred entangled qubits you require

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:42,810
more atoms that they are implanted

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,200
if we devoted every atom on earth to

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,240
store bits we couldn't represent what

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,790
the entangled state of a hundred cubed

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,770
machine would be by the time you have

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:57,150
280 you need all the atoms of the

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,220
universe to be able to do this so this

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,830
is the interesting aspect of a quantum

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,470
computer that we have these two to the N

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,900
where n is the number of qubits paths

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:08,640
that we can explore and that's what we

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,560
mean that is exponentially costly to

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,860
mimic it ok so I told you a special

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,810
property that is unique in its character

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,580
in its representation in quantum

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,820
computers alright so now we're gonna

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,230
explore what you can do with it so this

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,970
is actually what our quantum computer

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,900
looks like so the first second statement

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,790
I want to tell you that quantum

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,550
computers are real and after many

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,220
decades of working on them now we have

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,290
small but working quantum computers this

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,690
is an example of a quantum computer in

00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,670
the lab I showed you in my first slide

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,740
and what you're seeing hanging from the

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,740
ceiling is a dilution refrigerator and

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,870
the inside of a quantum computer looks

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,400
like this which incidentally are the

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,420
most beautiful computers we have ever

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,270
built in IBM so what you're seeing here

00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,100
is their wiring that goes to the bottom

00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,430
of that canister where the quantum

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,890
processor sits those are superconducting

00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,800
coaxial cables because they input into a

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,680
quantum computer of this kind our

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,590
microwave pulses that's how we send the

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,960
information in and out and the inside at

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,570
the bottom of it it operates at 15 milli

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,200
Kelvin which is a hundred times colder

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,970
than outer space and and at the bottom

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,460
of it we have this quantum processor

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,450
were that we also design and fabricate

00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,800
at IBM so the power of it is that if you

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,840
look at it from an information theory

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,700
perspective the potential of quantum

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,469
computers is that in reality what we

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,539
have is we have easy problems that we

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,880
can solve with classical computers and

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,729
there are classes of problems that are

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,080
very hard to do classically right so the

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,270
most extreme versions of them are

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,190
np-hard problems and what quantum

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,339
computing tells us is that is the only

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,500
technology we know where some problems

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,270
of this character we could solve so I'm

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,370
going to show you some results

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,520
around machine-learning right now which

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,230
are hot off the press so here's the

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,970
experiment we have done on a simulation

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,070
or a theory running on a quantum

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,020
computer we are taking a training set

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,240
that you look on the left-hand side you

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,250
have black dots and golden dots a very

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,050
simple experiment and we're gonna use

00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,850
entanglement to encode the many

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,200
different attributes of these form of

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,790
supervised machine learning in the end

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,830
I'm trying to do the simple task of

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,020
classifying what's a goal dot and what's

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,610
a black dot this is a function I'm

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,800
trying to learn right those were my

00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,540
training set I don't have this function

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,459
fed to the computer but in the end I

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,950
want to know that when black dots appear

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,779
in the black areas the computer

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,930
classifies them appropriately and so on

00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,760
so the way a quantum algorithm works is

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,330
you put the computer in a superposition

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,040
of states first then you encode the

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,070
problem by altering the face of the

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,800
states and the magic is the interference

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:53,070
of these states to produce the result

00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,680
you want so I won't bore you the details

00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,410
of how you code it but basically is you

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,029
prepare this superposition you map the

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,670
training data in this quantum feature

00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,950
map and then you train the quantum

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,140
classifier and now here's the moment of

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,770
truth so this is the data to be

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,790
classified it's never seen it before and

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,899
here's a result the result is that using

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,760
entanglement the more entanglement I

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,399
have here's an example of entanglement

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,680
depth one it improves my classification

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,810
accuracy two what we could do when I use

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,470
a quantum computer without entanglement

00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,680
so I've shown that a property that is

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,350
exponentially costly to model on a

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,870
classical computer it's beneficial in

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,550
the task of classification so that's an

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,399
important first step in the direction

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,290
and I'll close by telling you we have

00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,839
three working quantum computers

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:48,029
available for free on the IBM cloud just

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,010
to give you a flavor just in five days

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,230
these are the number of experiments that

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,089
people are running on a real quantum

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,339
computers not simulations running on

00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:00,329
real systems all over the world in just

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:02,550
five days so over eighty thousand users

00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:05,400
over 4 million experiments have been run

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,649
over 70 papers have been written using

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,899
the tool

00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,459
Wizkid is a means to write you know it's

00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,649
kind of an open environment for you to

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:14,749
experiment and try this and I really

00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:16,579
recommend that you give it a shot and

00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:19,369
I'll close with this statement that our

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,779
head of theory at IBM Research said in a

00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:23,540
passive meeting and it's become a model

00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:25,670
for us so when everybody whenever we're

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,470
talking with somebody else and they're

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,939
not quite thinking about the new

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,499
possibilities or what it means to

00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:33,230
exploit a quantum computer he says

00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:34,610
you're thinking too classically and and

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,140
I think that's a good model to explore

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:40,480
quantum computing thank you

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,480
[Applause]
