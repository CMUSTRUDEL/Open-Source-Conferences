good morning as I said I'm Marybeth

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,210
Ainsworth and I lead marketing for

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:12,980
artificial intelligence at SAS SAS is a

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,929
leading analytics company and we offer a

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,270
comprehensive set of AI capabilities to

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,609
help organizations around the world find

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,310
innovative ways to solve challenging

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,640
problems whether those problems exist

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,510
within a large corporation or out in the

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,340
wild hundred years ago we had somewhere

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,890
in the region of a hundred thousand

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,809
cheetahs in the world today the number

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,090
stands at just seven thousand one

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,280
hundred we're depending on data and

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,230
analytics to protect these animals we've

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,149
got data coming in from everywhere too

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,620
many data for us to manage traditionally

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,649
and that's really where artificial

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,890
intelligence comes in our challenge is

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,600
how to harness this in order to answer

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,989
some of the most fundamental questions

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,420
and create an environment where there's

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:06,479
room for us and all the rest of the

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:11,430
species in this world what if curiosity

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,150
could save the cat a cornerstone for

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:18,229
every conservation plan is understanding

00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,360
density and distribution in a given area

00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,119
so how many cheetahs are there and where

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,470
are they located

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,759
traditional monitoring techniques like

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,250
radio telemetry and tagging are invasive

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,350
and they require direct contact with

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,930
animals and have been shown to be

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,829
harmful to fertility and overall animal

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,240
health so the wild tract founders

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,210
featured in the clip that you just

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,000
watched discovered that density and

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,130
distribution could be monitored

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,860
non-invasively by analyzing animal

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:59,159
footprints but footprints are unique

00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:02,210
every indentation made is different than

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,130
every other step made before it an

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,489
animal species and gender can be

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:11,129
determined by their footprints but the

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,470
complexity of using footprints to plot

00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,069
density and distribution grows with the

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,230
need to

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,170
English between individual animals and

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,159
the many features that make up their

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,829
individual footprints subtracting

00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:29,599
animals conserving wildlife it's

00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:32,969
foundational to many tribal cultures

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,239
tracking is an art in a skill that has

00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,099
been passed down through generations and

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,730
is built on years of evolutionary

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:45,569
knowledge so working alongside these

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:48,359
trackers and building on their years of

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,310
expertise these conservationists

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:53,040
developed a scientific approach to

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,000
identifying footprints and began to

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,099
build a digital database of images but

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,769
this method the application of

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:06,209
morphometrics to analyzing footprints

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:09,689
was still very manual time-consuming and

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,540
difficult to scale and that's where sass

00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,579
expertise in deep learning and computer

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,709
vision was really able to make an impact

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:20,790
for a wild track and the animals they

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,900
work to conserve so we were able to

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,549
automate from that database the

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,069
identification of species and gender in

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,900
a way that took these experts 20 minutes

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,109
or more to identify a footprint and

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,689
reduce it down to seconds but in this

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:41,310
case object detection provides some

00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:44,189
unique algorithmic challenges on the

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:48,329
screen you will see that a tracker has

00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:52,379
identified a footprint how many of you

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:55,650
can clearly see an image that you would

00:03:52,379 --> 00:04:00,479
determine to be a footprint show of

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:04,530
hands okay and how many of you can

00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:09,750
clearly distinguish the outline or the

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:12,239
edges of that print so for our detection

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:16,409
we're essentially asking the machine to

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,889
remove the object the footprint from its

00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:23,699
background the earth when in fact they

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:27,210
are one and the same and the earth those

00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,980
backgrounds vary greatly the basis of

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,780
this work

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,270
work is the focus of my session this

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,800
afternoon titled improving wildlife

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,050
conservation with artificial

00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,700
intelligence and you can learn more at

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,300
the SAS booth which is located in

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:44,240
between the Intel and O'Reilly booths so

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,640
curiosity curiosity is what led

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,130
scientists to ask questions like is

00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,460
there a non-invasive way to monitor

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:54,830
wildlife is it possible to use the art

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,560
of tracking to scientifically understand

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:00,710
density and distribution it's curiosity

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,720
that brought AI into the wild so what if

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,940
curiosity is the thing that saves the

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,410
cat I hope you'll join me this afternoon

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:11,649
to learn more thank you

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,649
[Applause]
