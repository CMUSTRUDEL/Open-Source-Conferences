and finally I think this is really

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,000
important is we have a really large

00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,500
community of ecosystem partners that

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,660
we're working really really closely with

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,639
right so you as an enterprise you don't

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,949
want to do this on your own I mean you

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,050
want to sort of solicited external

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,510
support there are great partners that

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,609
build sort of point solutions and help

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,720
you scale and that's a community that we

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,849
want to build and sort of help address

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,019
some of these challenges right so that's

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:32,610
something that I want to talk to you

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,239
about today is what I'm really excited

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,829
about is that we are launching this

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,530
partner program called Intel ai builders

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,200
which essentially brings together these

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:45,510
these ecosystem partners to help

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,530
accelerate the adoption of AI right so

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,270
as an enterprise you may be looking for

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,489
looking to sort of integrate AI

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,530
workloads into your product portfolio or

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,510
the solutions that you're building there

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,730
are a lot of is fees for example that

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,649
are building these solutions there are

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,390
you know sis and OEMs that are helping

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,860
scale this so what we're really doing

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,409
here is bringing those communities

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,310
together as a formalized program so that

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:14,250
we can sort of you know help help drive

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,590
this innovation right well what's the

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,330
benefit so the end of the day if you're

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,430
looking to join the partner program as a

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,290
is V and Auriemma or si what you really

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,420
what meal provide is sort of that

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,159
technical foundation that comes with

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,390
Intel right so training technical

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,610
support we have a cloud-based platform

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,369
called the AI dev cloud for example that

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,100
that is exclusively for REI build as

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,470
partners to sort of build these models

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,840
test them and scale them out right so

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:49,799
the goal here is to provide the

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,110
infrastructure and also the the software

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,210
toolkits frameworks that are optimized

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,820
for Xeon for example as part of that

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,189
solution so that our partners can sort

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,630
of innovate on this platform right what

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,210
we're also doing is sort of committing

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,540
to you know giving access to our

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,479
partners in terms of co-marketing match

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,160
and eventually potential consideration

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,380
for investment as well right so we are

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,570
doing obviously a lot of these events we

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,110
have a lot of digital marketing support

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,140
that we can provide we also have a

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,120
builder solution repository or library

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,730
where we can host these solutions right

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,270
and what that facilitates is matchmaking

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,130
between your solutions and enterprises

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,130
that are looking for access to these

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,410
solutions right and as I pointed out you

00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,510
know we have a really large investment

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,640
arm within Intel as well and they made a

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,980
lot of investments globally not only in

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,020
the US but in Asia and other places

00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,390
where they are really looking for

00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,000
innovative startups in the AI space so

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,770
that's something that we can sort of

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,050
integrate into this into this offering

00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,100
as well as a potential opportunity for

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,820
investment if that's something that

00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,820
you're looking for

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,500
