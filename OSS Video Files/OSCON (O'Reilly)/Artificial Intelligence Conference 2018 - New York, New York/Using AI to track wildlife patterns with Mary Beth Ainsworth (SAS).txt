hi I'm Park Nathan from O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,189
and we're here at AI new york 2018 it's

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,280
a pleasure to talk with Meredith

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:14,190
answereth from your the Senior Product

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,389
Marketing Manager from SAS wonderful Oh

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,279
welcome my bet

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:19,320
I really enjoyed your keynote this

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,029
morning could you tell us a little bit

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,060
more about the session talk to you've

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,090
got coming up into details on the topics

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,740
I talked about in my keynote so a lot of

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,019
exciting work that SAS is doing around

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,820
wildlife conservation and the

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,260
application of deep learning and

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,750
computer vision and what's really great

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,820
about this work is that the scientists

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,950
who brought the work with us right

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,570
they've been doing this for decades and

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,899
it truly is a passion of theirs and

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,510
they've been using statistical software

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,610
to sort of look at the measurements of

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,059
animal footprints and and able and

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,230
looking to use footprints to monitor

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,899
density and distribution in an area for

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:02,609
understanding wildlife levels and giving

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,409
that as input into conservation plans

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,920
and so to be able to take something that

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,659
they've been doing and a method that

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
they've created and in many ways

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,409
perfected and to be able to find ways to

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,090
automate that with the newest technology

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:20,869
and finding ways to scale those efforts

00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:23,400
it's really great to see how you take

00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:26,850
biologists zoologists who are experts

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,850
really in animal welfare and looking at

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,979
continent and how to create impactful

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,770
conservation plans and now we can take

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,100
take them from that manual task of

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,049
taking a picture manually analyzing it

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,610
in putting it into a database and speed

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,820
that up and automate that and give them

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,250
time back to actually focus on this very

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,079
human problem and these human solutions

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,490
of what are the best ways to implement a

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,340
conservation plan design

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,560
a conservation plan that really does

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,780
have impact and does meaningfully

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,009
protect to these animals and

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,750
understanding the importance of

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,909
biodiversity to all of us on the planet

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,119
and so it's exciting to see how

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:12,269
technology takes something that's so far

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,680
removed from our daily lives and can

00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:18,690
really make a difference out there and

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,730
we consider the wild late

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,819
there was a photo that you showed that

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,140
was just fantastic of how to even spot

00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,450
where the tracks are how to measure it

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,130
seemed like almost a superhuman task to

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,370
me there's no way I can really approach

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,620
it but now with AI we can help to

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,180
augment people and and really increase

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,480
the power of what these scientists are

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,330
doing and so being able to identify

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,620
those footprints the indigenous trackers

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,370
do it all the time they've been doing it

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,380
for years and the scientist I work with

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,540
tell you tell a story of when they used

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,459
to go out and look for animals they

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,890
would look out at the horizon because

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,239
that's where we look for animals and

00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,680
then they're out there with the trackers

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,720
and the trackers are looking at the dirt

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,760
looking at the ground and they said what

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,040
are you looking at and they show it how

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,480
they can say this is a cheetah print and

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,790
based on the size it's probably a female

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,750
and they look at things like where did

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,480
the animal feed

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,549
what is the track the animal made they

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,920
take into account climate and the Sun

00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:19,470
and things that really take all that

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,670
human perception so the challenge is how

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,290
do you have a machine learn one aspect

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,450
of what that tracker can see and do

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,030
quickly but that's a skill set and it's

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,459
evolutionary knowledge so how can we use

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,120
technology to replicate that skill set

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,100
in a way that increases the ability for

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,690
all of us to make impact although we may

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,540
not have that expertise and that skill

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,489
set and that there's an effort moving

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,260
forward where anyone can go take a

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,940
picture on their smartphone with it but

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,370
for interesting and upload it for that

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,319
organization and to have access to that

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,680
database and be able to apply artificial

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,600
intelligence to that so you know the the

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,060
founders of wildtrak will say not

00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,650
everyone can dart a rhino but anyone can

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,940
take a picture of a footprint right and

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,829
and and people are out there right I

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,050
mean people is sort of like citizen data

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,360
science it's more like citizen

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,130
yeah I mean it's a great opportunity for

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,290
people to learn more if you don't know

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,700
anything about wildlife conservation if

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,890
you didn't know that she deserve

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,590
honorable species then all of a sudden

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,170
we've increased our ability to spread

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,250
knowledge and get people involved in a

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,800
way they may not have otherwise been

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,120
able to get involved I'm curious have

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,250
you gotten to work with any cheetahs

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,230
personally get that opportunity but I've

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,110
learned a lot in working with the

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:38,490
organization and even some of the

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,980
footage and the images that they have

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,440
are just incredible animals fastest land

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,060
animal I didn't fascist I took my

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,620
daughters to a place where they raise

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,540
cheetahs recently in there

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,550
they're like the largest cat that purrs

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:53,160
if they're really fantastic when you're

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,140
up close than their purring well can we

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,660
talk a little bit also about in general

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:03,600
what kinds of areas are is that's going

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:05,400
into with a company you've been around

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,040
for 40 something years and machine

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,510
learning is really in our roots and so

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,210
while people sometimes think of us as a

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:14,010
statistics company or you know even

00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,630
analytics people are still want equate

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:18,330
analytics with artificial intelligence

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:22,050
and they don't understand sometimes how

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:25,100
much more than statistics that we do at

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,150
our core and machine learning is

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,400
foundational to almost every product

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,620
that we put out into the market and the

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,270
areas that we focus on we have focus on

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,910
and are continuing to focus on our

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,920
machine learning and deep learning

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,480
computer vision a whole bucket of

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,610
natural language capabilities so

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,490
processing understanding interaction

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,830
generation and then forecasting an

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,720
optimization and those are sort of our

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,030
core focus areas of AI and what we're

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,820
doing is we embed them throughout our

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,099
SAS platform and so as our R&D group

00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:00,210
makes advances in

00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:03,599
a I research and coming up with new

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,789
methods and new developments customers

00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,379
don't have to buy those from us they

00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,869
just come out and feature releases in

00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,509
our next product so everything that we

00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:15,710
are achieving an RD is pushed right out

00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:18,539
to our customers and so a is so core to

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,909
nearly everything that we do that you

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,360
know customers don't buy nai product

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:25,770
from us they buy whatever technology

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,879
helps them solve their problem and

00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,099
they're going to be AI techniques

00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,949
embedded in that actually so for the

00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:34,409
customers then it's not as much as being

00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:36,089
a specialist in AI it's really in

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,979
viewing AI into a lot of different

00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,289
domains a lot of different types of

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,569
verticals and so we say we support the

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:44,729
analytics lifecycle so data discovery

00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:47,550
deployment and that includes AI so our

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,169
court AI capabilities sit in what we

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,209
call the discovery phase and then we

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,279
provide supporting technologies and data

00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,330
and deployment to say that you know what

00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,249
our customers are looking to create an

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,080
AI system right there are things that

00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,919
meet the definition of AI and then there

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,379
are things that you need to

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,879
operationalize AI and that includes a

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,039
great data management plan the ability

00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,899
to visualize your results decision

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,669
management support and then you know the

00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,169
ability to take those fantastic models

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,180
you built and then deploy them and put

00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,089
them in production and so we provide

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,339
support for that entire lifecycle on our

00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:18,959
platform understanding that yes you need

00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:20,819
the core AI capabilities but then you

00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,519
also have to make that work in a larger

00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,899
system taking in more factors and and so

00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,309
that's where our focus is is that

00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,680
everything we do goes into that

00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:31,800
lifecycle and that understanding that we

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,469
want to help customers really put those

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,059
models out at the enterprise level

00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:37,439
fantastic what are some of the

00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,120
interesting verticals that you're seeing

00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,569
some of the different application areas

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,399
in particular you know what we see is

00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,959
that just like with the big data boom

00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,839
the early adopters are financial

00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,449
services from healthcare we're seeing a

00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,029
lot of growth industry and manufacturing

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:56,399
interesting um typically a slower area

00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:58,469
to come forward but and right in line

00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,709
with them is government so you have

00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:04,050
manufacturing and government who are

00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:04,289
typically slower to adopt technologies

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,059
and

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:07,740
they're kind of more proven out kind of

00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:10,050
coming forward and saying wait a minute

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,399
where is that competitive edge how does

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,289
this make me work better how does this

00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,849
weight make me work smarter and then

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:17,580
there's really I'm in those industries

00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:20,610
in particular focus on how do we reduce

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,119
risk where you know you know how can we

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,349
have transparency and governance and SAS

00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:27,270
does a lot of work around that as well

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:29,449
so we do a lot with making sure that

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,860
we're building interpretable AI systems

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,019
making sure that we you know we talk

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,539
about ethics just because you you can do

00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,899
something doesn't mean you should

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,490
and gdpr gives us I think a lot of

00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,289
insight into that that you know

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,610
especially around consent so just cuz

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,740
something can be done have we really

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:50,040
consented right that it should be done

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,930
as a society and and so for industries

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,279
that are highly regulated you know we're

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,589
doing a lot of work to make sure that

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,990
they understand that not every algorithm

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:00,149
is a blackbox so if you need an

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,550
interpretable system there's a plethora

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:05,190
of algorithms to choose from an AI is

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,079
still able to have a large impact in

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,180
highly regulated areas as well so I

00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,019
would say financial services and

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,300
healthcare are kind of where you see

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:17,790
really large investments and retail as

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,829
well but I'm surprised by the speed at

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,139
which manufacturing and government seems

00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:24,060
to be looking into adopting technology

00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:26,250
as well well that's fantastic also very

00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,810
much needed yes well it's an interesting

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,880
point through bringing a to its it's not

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,709
just about having platform it's also

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,630
about all the other learnings that come

00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,420
along at an organizational level the

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,100
best practices privacy and thinking you

00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,630
had about ethics and all that so it's a

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,970
lot of what you're bringing to the

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:44,480
picture then is is how to convey these

00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:47,610
best practices and I talked a lot about

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,189
leadership in AI and that's really what

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,510
we need and that for a very first thing

00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,800
that needs to you know people need to

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,380
focus on or bring AI into an

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,120
organization or the people but your

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,500
people have to make it work and not and

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,880
you have skill sets in many

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,860
organizations that can do a lot of what

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,010
is in the market as

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,650
hype it just hasn't been labeled a I in

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,900
the past even though it is and so

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,850
whether it's investing in your existing

00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,540
workforce to get them the new training

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:21,240
and exposure to some of these newer

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,010
methods or you know recruiting right out

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,370
of universities there's a huge skills

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:32,760
gap facing the workplace so you know

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:35,310
it's investing in people and then being

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,930
able to figure out what your strategy is

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,540
and clearly articulate that to everyone

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,130
involved from your developers to your

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,900
data scientist to your solutions

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,970
engineers to your business users so

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,770
everyone knows why you're adopting AI

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,140
what you plan to do with it what the

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,640
expectations are and then making sure

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,500
that there are some kind of governance

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,120
and ethical and moral structure over

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,190
that as well and that it really it all

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,620
comes back down to leading people when

00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,570
it comes to implementing AI fantastic

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,830
well thank you very much for everything

00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,830
