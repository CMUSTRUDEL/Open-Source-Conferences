hi I'm Paco Nathan from O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,780
we're here at AI new york 2018 and it's

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,920
a pleasure today to get to speak with

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,179
i've just funded your global head of

00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,500
igneel pre-sales and product specialists

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,710
and also

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,510
Jayanthi moti your head of strategic

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,920
enterprise accounts and product

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,099
evangelists both from digit 8 and so

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,539
welcome today thank you

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:35,219
first off can you tell me more about

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,780
digit 8 yes digit 8 as is a business

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,870
unit of a company called Tata

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,760
Consultancy Services so TCS is about 18

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,739
billion dollar services organization in

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,600
IT size and this date is primarily a

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,960
product unit and Eugenio is our primary

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,489
product here so as Theseus we have been

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,770
always building a lot of productivity

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,079
accelerators and a lot of automation

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,789
into it but few years back we were able

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
to apply machine learning techniques and

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,019
the technology that we created we

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,540
decided to create a product order

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,799
because and that's where digit 8 came

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,140
into existence

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,000
working with IT but then automating

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,189
using machine learning applications

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,280
inside of IT sounds fascinating it seems

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,479
like a really good domain for being able

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,100
to apply machine learning so you have I

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,630
can imagine that when it comes to

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,880
deployment scripts when it comes to a

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,000
lot of data for telemetry all this feeds

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,750
in law absolutely and a lot of it has to

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,420
do with marrying the concepts of machine

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,490
learning and AI as a technology with the

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,909
knowledge that is curated from a very

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,680
large services background so while there

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,530
are lot of AI and machine learning

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,869
platforms that have lot of generic

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,610
capabilities the machine learning

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,040
capabilities within ignore actually

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,590
optimized for use cases that span across

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,110
IT and business operations so that is

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,899
what makes you know ignore that much

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,450
interesting and more unique because of

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,450
the way it has been designed to cover

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,179
the operations needs of an enterprise

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,519
using you know the state of the art and

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:12,650
technologies are fantastic I can imagine

00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:15,140
from perspective TCS you're seeing

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,909
across the board so many different kinds

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,680
of environments and use cases absolutely

00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:21,049
I mean you're working with Fortune 500

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,790
companies I cross the vertical so we

00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:24,829
have work with retailers we work with

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,650
manufacturing companies insurance

00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:30,530
companies large banks and globally so

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,939
primarily what is bringing in here apart

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,709
from machine learning cognitive

00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,900
techniques like gene they were saying

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,340
bringing the knowledge and applying it

00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,260
in the context of the particular

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,419
industries so how for example a retailer

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,209
would be facing challenges versus a

00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:46,849
manufacturer so that's where the whole

00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,409
contextual knowledge comes in and that's

00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,299
where they believe there is a

00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,459
significant power that we can apply with

00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,139
this technology for yeah I would like to

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,230
add another interesting point is that

00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:00,590
while you know there is the parent

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:02,959
funding organization for digitate from

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,549
the TCS side you know we operate

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,939
independently as a software product

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:10,549
brand and the approach to developing the

00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:13,519
Neo is that of any any other software

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,629
and next-generation software so I would

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,510
say that's a strength that we are

00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:19,250
uniquely positioned between the industry

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,799
and the services background and the

00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,319
product technology that we develop to

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,790
make sure and understand what what's the

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,470
maximum value that the customers can

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,599
derive out and how they can maximize the

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,659
benefits are of this excellence well

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,199
within this area then of product what

00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:40,220
would you say where the uniqueness about

00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:42,069
it new so I will probably take a shot

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,500
and then you can you can add a widget

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:47,720
from the point of view of uniqueness the

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,759
way we have designed this whole product

00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,489
the core philosophy of the product is to

00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:56,030
empower people to do more so that that's

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:59,180
our mission statement as well so the way

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,930
we have designed this product is to have

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,419
a technology layer which applies a lot

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:08,359
of the machine learning techniques that

00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:12,409
are popular and marry them with

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:15,079
knowledge that is required to resolve

00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:17,000
issues in the context of a particular

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,560
situation so if you really take the

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,959
contextual knowledge of

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,590
enterprise or a business and then take

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,540
the skills and the technologies that are

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,130
required to resolve operational issues

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,050
around that you can you're kind of

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,389
brings in both the perspectives using

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,300
state of that technology and the way it

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:38,240
is done organized to fit in seamlessly

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,770
into an enterprise landscape and talk to

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,200
the various business systems out there

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:44,780
the various instrumentation systems the

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,150
various system management components and

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,700
source work for itself and executed

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,400
drives a great deal of productivity

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,200
benefits great deal of you know

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,450
resiliency and stability benefits and

00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:01,070
most importantly we feel really you know

00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,470
strong position to be influencing the

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,380
experience for customer and and that

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,960
sort kind of makes this whole approach

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,560
unique because it kind of changes the a

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,240
big shift from a people first approach

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,810
to a machine first approach and that's

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,960
enabled by igneel yeah so just building

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,780
onto onto that ignore when we put it in

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,940
action it essentially changes certain

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,169
paradigms in which IT service delivery

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,310
half is happening traditionally so it's

00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,500
like the technology first model or

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,120
machine first model where the people are

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,890
now becoming the configurators or

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,289
administrators of the machine and

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,570
machine has the primary right of way in

00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:43,660
terms of determining where the potential

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,919
faults is determining what you see

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,470
probable cause why the issues are coming

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,600
in and actually fixing it so we complete

00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,000
the full cycle many times people think

00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,590
that yeah AI technology is machine

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,510
learning technologies are primarily used

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,970
for analytics purposes tell me where the

00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,570
fault is and or curate the knowledge and

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,550
all that stuff

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,590
but we go one step further to actually

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,720
take the decisions and do the

00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,750
self-healing of the systems that the

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,580
actions the actual action taking part so

00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,380
the paradigm change that that happens is

00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,090
you're becoming today the most of the

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,950
stuff is reactive and everybody wants to

00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,440
be ahead of the curve you can you

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,510
provides that ability to the IT teams to

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,490
be predictive and proactive in terms of

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:26,199
doing self-healing that's ultimately

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,389
their power one last point is that

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,919
is an Intelligence Platform it is

00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,289
essentially a platform that brings in

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,539
intelligence I we kind of bring in three

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,830
kinds of intelligence so we bring in

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:37,629
recognition intelligence the

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,969
intelligence that understands the

00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:42,789
context of an enterprise we bring in

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:45,520
reasoning intelligence which understands

00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,560
the insights and the normal behaviors

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,240
and the tendencies and the trends and so

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,439
on and so forth and then we bring the

00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,539
operative intelligence which is the

00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,430
intelligence required to take actions so

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,370
we actually bring in all these three

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,289
types of intelligence and a deal also

00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,999
can be used viewed as an intelligence

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,219
platform so that that's another

00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:05,740
viewpoint as well from the way we

00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:08,800
approach this product in technology good

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,870
oh can we drill down into some of the

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,060
kinds of use cases then you're seeing

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,740
absolutely yeah like some of the use

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,089
cases would be like we are working with

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,379
one of insurer and in a particular

00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,449
sector of a particular market they had a

00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,460
very unique problem and the problem was

00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,580
you buy for one buy a travelin surance

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,139
and the end user gets the you pay the

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,960
premium and you expect that here a

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:33,430
policy document would come and but you

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,649
know because some reason it doesn't come

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,620
so you know you expect that you might

00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:40,389
come in an email and you're almost

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,419
reaching to the travel date and you

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,430
still don't have the policy in hand you

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,169
frantically call the help desk of this

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,029
company and because this is only one

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:51,250
user which is getting impacted your

00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:54,099
ticket internal is classified as unity

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,819
475 which probably takes two days four

00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:59,560
days five days and mostly what is likely

00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:01,810
to happen is next time probably you're

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,879
not going to by travelpod again from the

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,099
same insurer now in this when you look

00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,169
at this problem statement there is an

00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:09,939
obvious disconnect lag between what

00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:12,849
business is facing what IT is delivering

00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:14,499
and this happens all the time and even

00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:17,139
if an IT said we all have great

00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:18,789
dashboards which all look green but from

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:21,099
experience perspective from customer's

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,569
perspective it's red so like an

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:24,430
internally we call this as a Waterman a

00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,740
motor watermelon phenomenal like it

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,419
looks a green from you open it up it's

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,879
right so that's what is happening with

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,500
this so that's where we apply yo and we

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,630
say that the way this transaction is

00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,230
moving into the IT systems you can your

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,300
builds that whole behavior modeling

00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,830
and it understands what's the normal for

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,810
this transaction to get completed what

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,220
all things need to happen and if certain

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,260
things are not happening like in this

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:49,380
case the email is not going the policy

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,660
document it generates a alarm because it

00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,210
realizes this is abnormal into that

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,530
business process and it will start

00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,960
digging where that particular

00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,790
transaction failed so a I could actually

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,760
escalate where as customer service might

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,520
not excessive absolutely I mean this is

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,470
a problem where business is witnessing

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,960
that probably there is no repeat

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,510
business coming from the same customers

00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,420
that is what you can detect now which is

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,770
which is I think is a great opportunity

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,270
these are the things that that are

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,580
primarily what we are greatly interested

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,040
in and that is what is happening in fact

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,310
you know that this write fantastically

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,810
you know how it called gets from a weeds

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,090
perspective into the weeds perspective I

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:33,090
just abstract it out a little bit like

00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,930
if you generally take any operations

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:40,340
environment or any you know enterprise

00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:44,220
the whole idea is you should be able to

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:46,290
deliver stability experience agility and

00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,900
with the least amount of effort which is

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,050
efficiency thereby reducing cost

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:55,770
footprints so for doing that you need to

00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,440
be able to detect predict prevent learn

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,270
and resolve okay so if you really take

00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,020
all of these five capabilities and put

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,090
them together that's what kind of

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,500
attacks any use case that is requiring

00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,990
this file capability so it could be

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,640
things like IT operations where your

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:14,100
mission critical business critical

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,690
systems need to be up and running they

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,220
need to be resilient you need to be able

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,420
to predict the failures you need to be

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,160
able to bring them back up when they go

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,770
down the business impact has to be

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,770
minimized to the point of you know

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,080
legacy backs systems which have tens and

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,390
hundreds of thousands of jobs and you

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,400
know one feed file late to you you are

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,400
basically taking days to catch up right

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,890
to be able to instantly in real time say

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,240
that hey I can see this ten jobs filling

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,990
in the next couple hours and to take

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,910
action for that - you know customer

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,500
facing operations things like employee

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,660
onboarding right every new employee

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,519
joining the company

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,899
needs to be unloaded and onboarding

00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,790
experience is pretty critical for the

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,829
employee but then down what it costs us

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,269
itself that is eight to ten different

00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,269
systems in the enterprise rack and it

00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,819
takes time so igneous also been used to

00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,509
address you know composite business

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:08,609
workflows like employ on body and if you

00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:10,919
see the spectrum of use cases that they

00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:13,259
give is interesting to where you employ

00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,509
onboarding which is a mission-driven

00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,689
intelligent automation driven business

00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,339
user facing to you know bad job systems

00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:23,970
which are more legacy but which impact

00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:26,609
the business processes to resiliency of

00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:29,790
super critical IT systems so the use

00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:31,619
cases span a wide spectrum and and

00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,629
that's the kind of things that we are

00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:35,970
addressing from customer to customer

00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,269
vertical to what becomes interesting so

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,439
it sounds like then by work by going

00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,799
through these different steps in these

00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:46,350
workflows there's also a very important

00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,489
quality of cutting across silos I can

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,669
imagine that a lot of these kinds of

00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:52,739
problems get siloed and right absolutely

00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,139
there is no traditionally IT service

00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:56,669
delivery models have been either because

00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,559
of the technology reasons either because

00:11:56,669 --> 00:12:01,319
of the traditionally how the companies

00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:04,079
have grown skills that have been divided

00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:05,819
so teams pretty much operate in silos

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,769
and things fall through the cracks

00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,999
because majority of the critical

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,009
business transactions cut across

00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,660
multiple things like for example we are

00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,879
working with one of the healthcare

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,829
services providers so very unique

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,199
situation it's a wellness program that

00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:21,419
they have launched into the market a lot

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,439
of you know yoga studios and you know

00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,629
all the people who provide a lot of

00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:26,939
wellness things to the end customers and

00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:29,939
they give lot of discounts and heavily

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:31,829
planted item area into into this now one

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:34,319
of the interesting issue is you go and

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,939
enroll into a yoga studio on behalf of

00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:37,350
this health care provider you get some

00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:40,499
discounts on that so you get into this

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,689
and you every courses that you take

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,369
everything that you do there those

00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:46,079
details go back to this health care

00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:48,059
provider and so that the reconciliation

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,929
happens you get the points it's a very

00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:54,809
simple model but because the sometimes

00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:56,850
the bad systems fail the files that move

00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:58,889
from the use yoga studio systems to this

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,150
health care provider they won't process

00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:02,650
well they could don't go on time

00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,570
you know you're not able to accrue the

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,010
points or you're not able to convert

00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,860
those and get the necessary discounts

00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:10,960
and that results big time on to customer

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,580
dissatisfaction it's a big problem

00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,040
because so many people are now into

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,900
wellness rather than you know just

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,089
acquiring all these benefits so that's

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,560
where you can you can help big time

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,089
because now this problem is cutting

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,400
across multiple silos within the

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,410
organization and that's why we are able

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,960
to apply this technology effectively to

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,170
break those silos and bring the benefits

00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,360
out I think I think you've kind of hit

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,730
the nail on it said when you said that

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,460
break silos at the end of the day if you

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,110
see from an enterprise whatever work

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,230
originates you know whether we want to

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:46,029
predict revenue and resolve that work

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,490
essentially comes to an organization

00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,320
that is designed to handle that fatigue

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,060
leo that paradigm shift is that igneous

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,610
stands in between the work and this

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,130
organization and they the first right of

00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,480
refusal if you will and it changes the

00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,760
volume and composition of the work

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,640
that's coming into your observation is

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,690
very interesting and that allows for

00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,970
breaking down the silos in a much better

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,459
way because today the best days in your

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,110
organization are actually firefighting

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:13,089
stories are you so you're augmenting

00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,450
them giving the absolutely using AI to

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,560
amplify the amount that they can do

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,350
fantastic so you can also call it as an

00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,050
intelligent virtual experts one would

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,730
phrase we use well without getting in

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:27,459
the names can you talk about some of

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,260
your key customer cases definitely

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:33,940
definitely so I think we get in kind

00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:35,890
I'll add a couple so across the IT

00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:38,589
operations use case you know we have a

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,560
customer who has used

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:43,540
igni or two predominantly intelligently

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,600
automate a lot of the IT operations

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,490
activities in the backend

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,520
there are a lot of issues and down times

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,230
and outages that result from capacity

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,080
overhead issues application availability

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,700
issues and usually the cycle time for

00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,920
there's always that issues is from house

00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,490
to the audits but see real business

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,920
impact

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,320
they've been essentially gotten igneel

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,200
and they have applied declare to self

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,240
feel from a lot of these incidents

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,760
automate you know routine but complex

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,040
job satisfaction

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,590
that a white spectrum and today I would

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,070
say news doing several tens of thousands

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,690
of hours of work a month so it's at and

00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,180
as a result we are like turning it

00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:26,790
around in a few minutes for tasks that

00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,470
take hours and and so on and so forth

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,860
not only there is financial benefit to

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,960
it there is a great uptake in the

00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,520
resiliency and what we have also

00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,610
interestingly notices for that

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,500
environment the adoption of igneel is

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:43,860
proportional to the benefits that is

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,210
delivering so more use cases they're

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,250
seeing greater benefits and that's

00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:52,020
feeding into more use cases it's a

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,550
cyclical effect and that that's one you

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,310
know customer scenario and this is a

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,500
pretty much retail media research kind

00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,510
of industry on the banking financial

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,430
services side me we have a customer

00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:07,620
who's you know entire match landscape

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:10,380
igneel actually acts as a analytics

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,120
platform to tell them about the risk

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,920
profile of their jobs because for them

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,350
they need to finish their batch

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,630
processing at certain time in the night

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,730
otherwise you know these days users take

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,580
to social media to save in the car do

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,170
something right and then let me say it's

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,970
super critical to understand what's the

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,550
risk profile report jobs are likely to

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,610
fail you know how does this impact their

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:35,400
operations to be able to glean through

00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:37,650
you know terabytes of data to get these

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,320
insights out and give it to your command

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:44,100
center operations to exactly take action

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,730
to prevent and resolve them and that has

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,530
you know generated I would say several

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,020
hundred notifications of impending

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:56,190
figures that were potentially avoided so

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,600
that's another kind of yeah so some of

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,030
the retailers like one of the retailer

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,800
we had really started working during the

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,690
peak season they were always having

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,730
issues into their e-commerce engine and

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,560
because the site load and you know all

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,910
the other technical issues so we have

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,800
started implementing igneel

00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,360
and we deployed a lot of health checks a

00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,449
lot of cell field alerted capabilities

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,190
and during that peak season the last one

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,199
that that they went through

00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,490
instead of issues coming in now they

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,410
were able to witness fifty percent

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,329
customer growth into that particular

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,459
area so that was like without changing

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:27,439
anything into their car

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,080
and existing infrastructure or

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,210
application so that was the power that

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,799
we were able to bring out and you know

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,450
bring that benefit to the business

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,340
because many times people think that

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,679
yeah this is an IT shoe systems issue

00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,970
right you know things don't work and

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,950
maybe we will have to invest something

00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,720
big into a new technology but you bring

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,429
in igneel and this was a change that we

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,710
were able to bring in substantial

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,020
bottom-line substantial toppling or

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,779
toppling I wrote here yeah fantastic

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,360
well one of the question you know I'm

00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:59,210
you know this is breaking new ground and

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,899
so this is an area of application of AI

00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,450
that I haven't seen as much before can

00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:07,970
you point out any cases of where others

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,279
have tried to work with this prior to

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,809
the kind of sophistication we have with

00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,539
machine learning now that you know some

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,070
contrast there yeah so I'll give you a

00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:17,840
slightly different clear probably I'll

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,200
let a budget throw some light on it as

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,840
well

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,610
so when you really look at a is the way

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,070
it has been used and it has been used

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:26,840
for a you know variety of use cases you

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,740
know whether it is healthcare to

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,140
research you know what have you and

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,820
there are a lot of AI platforms and

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,740
libraries that are out there which

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,309
people are actually customizing and

00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,770
using for delivering certain use cases

00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:45,110
now if you really look at from an igloo

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:48,440
perspective what we are doing with the

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:51,860
in terms of breaking ground is we feel

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,770
that to resolve any problem you you need

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,399
to have not just the skills to execute

00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:00,380
that result resolution but you need to

00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,210
have the contextual knowledge and you

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,760
need to have the ability to bring both

00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,950
of these together and that's where I

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,929
think all the ability to integrate with

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,850
the larger ecosystem see typically

00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,679
current AI platforms

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,659
traditionally they have been expensive

00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,940
experiments there bit short experiments

00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,360
there have been impediments to

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,730
industrializing them on a large scale

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,940
but here what we have done is it's more

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,250
an applied in which we have looked at as

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,350
a customer first enterprise first angle

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,630
such that we can industrialize we can

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,399
implement it scale so that the benefits

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,850
can be at scale because of the benefits

00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,400
are not at scale then

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,590
you know it becomes yet another pilot or

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,299
POC which I think has been talking any

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,840
new state-of-the-art technology for a

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:48,030
while now and and that's what you know

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,039
and there are a lot of very promising

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,020
organizations and startups and companies

00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,549
which are doing fantastic work in this

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,429
field with the various use cases but I

00:19:53,549 --> 00:20:00,450
think the trend now is shifting where

00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:05,000
every software platform is figuring out

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:07,740
some way of using nml do either extend

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,559
optimize or add new capabilities to

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,559
their own that's definitely a shift that

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,510
yeah like like you said this is very

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,890
much a unique application of AI and

00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,179
machine learning because most of the

00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,460
time when you think about air and

00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,409
machine learning personally people are

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,409
very comfortable with the conversational

00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:31,320
yeah like you take English language the

00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:33,750
whole word statements paragraph you make

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,280
this pattern sort of it you applied to

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,200
the voice you apply to the written

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,419
statements and you create the patterns

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,289
that's one of the very popular

00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:43,289
application that people always thought

00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:45,539
of in our case we started applying it on

00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:47,159
to the IT systems or the technology

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,110
components of how is the operating

00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,299
system working our database working and

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,330
things of that nature and I think that's

00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:56,460
where we primarily come from the lineage

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,679
of being a system integrator this is a

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,539
large system integration company

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,210
consulting company so we are very big

00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,640
into you can say practitioners of these

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,260
technologies before we applied machine

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,640
learning on to this so we actually knew

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,409
how these various technologies work

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,600
together in order to create the whole

00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:15,150
large systems you have that many has

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,260
that is so many part of the DNA yeah and

00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,299
that's where we were able to apply

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,090
machine learning and as they were saying

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,010
this this is very much of applied AI or

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:24,510
applied machine learning so this is not

00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,880
general purpose machine learning

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,980
algorithms and you throw in the data and

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,880
curate it and try and build the patterns

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,000
but this is something which is

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,830
fine-tuned towards the IT operations and

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,080
business operation side of the word so

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,059
that's the kind of a different path that

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,960
we have taken in under this whole area

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,480
antastic

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,169
oh I'm looking forward to keynote and

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,580
and talks tomorrow update janti thank

00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,580
