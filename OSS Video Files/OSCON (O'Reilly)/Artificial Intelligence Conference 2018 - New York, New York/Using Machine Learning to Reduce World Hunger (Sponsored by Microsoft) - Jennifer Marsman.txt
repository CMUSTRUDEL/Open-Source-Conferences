	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,950
hello in the year 2015 the world is

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,309
projected to have nine billion people

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:15,210
and at a meeting of the United Nations

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,789
in 2009 it was stated that we actually

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,740
need to double our current rates of food

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,949
production if we're going to be able to

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,869
feed the world's growing population so a

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,539
group of folks at Microsoft Research

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,090
started to think about that problem how

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,279
could we use technology to enable

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,520
data-driven farming and to maximize

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,320
yields for farmers and so we explored a

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,170
whole lot of ideas and one of them is

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,480
the idea of precision agriculture so if

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,760
you're not familiar with this idea in

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,860
the case of precision irrigation the

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,590
idea is instead of homogeneously

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,879
watering an entire field where every

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,760
part of the field gets the same amount

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,980
of water you can give each part of the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,480
field only the water that it needs so

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,210
when you think about it there's little

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,300
dips and divots in a field and so water

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,519
may run down and you know the bottom may

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,310
get more than the slope and then this

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,340
can also be applied to many other things

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,170
think of pesticides and applying

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,140
fertilizer and things like that you can

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,200
reduce costs by only using exactly what

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,240
you need and no more so this seems like

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,840
fairly easy to implement right we have a

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,970
Ooty

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
so we get some sensors and and see what

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,470
we can do with this now when I started

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,150
working on this project I was speaking

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,100
with our principal researcher Ranveer

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,110
Chandra and he told me one of the first

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,479
challenges is that it works out to

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,030
roughly 1,000 dollars a sensor to do

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,790
this that's not crazy to anyone else cuz

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,530
that's not crazy to me I was like no no

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,509
let me show you this website it's great

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,210
you can get sensors for like tens of

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,700
dollars not thousands of dollars and of

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,619
course he was well aware of this and it

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,990
turns out the problem is not of course

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,450
the sensor itself but the infrastructure

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,049
that is needed to support that so my

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,100
first thought was okay maybe it's power

00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,829
we obviously don't have electrical

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,099
outlets in the middle of a field in in

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,989
farmland so perhaps it's the cost of

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,610
that and it turns out that that is a

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,090
little bit but it's that's not the

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,519
majority of the cost we

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,980
shall we use solar panels to provide

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:23,980
power for the devices and the solar

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:27,220
panels run roughly 50 to $100 US per per

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,720
solar panel so that wasn't the issue if

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,299
you take a look at our setup we actually

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,560
have there's a it shows our sensor board

00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,910
right there you can see our sensor board

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,920
and it's enclosed in some waterproof

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,500
casing with some of the leads for

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,510
measurements coming out and then the

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,420
solar panel is on top and then and it

00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,090
works even in a gray Seattle where we

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,730
have one of our farms stood up and then

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,670
we also have a camera that's taking

00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,829
real-time imagery in both natural color

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:57,250
as well as infrared to give that

00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:59,290
real-time insights into the farm okay so

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,599
if it turns out it's not the solar

00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,519
panels it's not the sensor itself where

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,459
is that thousand dollars per sensor cost

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,790
coming from turns out it is connectivity

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,799
it's getting data from the actual

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,640
devices into the cloud where we can do

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,049
something useful with it now there's a

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,160
couple different things that we can do

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:19,389
I'm actually going to come back to

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,489
connectivity and how we can solve that

00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:22,720
better but for now let's assume that we

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,180
just want to reduce the number of

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,760
sensors since we have this $1,000 per

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,530
sensor price tag on it currently and so

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,079
to reduce the number of sensors there's

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:34,690
something that we can do and that is if

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,880
we have aerial imagery from overhead on

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,010
the farm and we use a smaller number of

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,980
sensors throughout we can actually use

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,880
machine learning to predict various

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,799
sensor readings

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,349
um in areas where we don't have sensors

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,370
and so we looked at gathering aerial

00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,410
imagery there's actually two different

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,769
ways we've done it we started with

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,329
drones and drones are you know great use

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,730
case for drones right there they can fly

00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,799
overhead we actually there's a small

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,209
screenshots there of an app that we made

00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,010
for the farmer so the farmers didn't

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,989
have to manually fly them they could

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,120
just set some points on an app and then

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,519
it would follow that path or they could

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,790
specify an area and the drone would do a

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,200
sweep over that area and we actually

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,479
programmed in some cool stuff to around

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,700
optimizing battery life to use the wind

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,590
and such so very very cool stuff there

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,780
but there are some issues with drones

00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,490
they their battery life even the best

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,169
drones can fly for maybe you know thirty

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,920
five minutes and you have a very big

00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,500
farm that can be

00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,910
challenging there is some cost to drones

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,860
they're going to be hundreds or

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,810
thousands of dollars but you just need

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,730
one and then the biggest thing is

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,590
regulations right there's a lot of

00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,200
places where it's just very difficult to

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:44,020
fly drones and it does change in every

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,390
country and so we also have a different

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,580
solution and that's using helium

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,130
balloons so these are tethered helium

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,050
balloons large helium balloons and we're

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,670
using that in several areas as well and

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,430
you can see that's Ranvir actually

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,560
launching one right now in that image

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,900
where it's a big helium balloon with a

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,910
camera attached and that can be staked

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,040
into the ground or it can be carried by

00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:08,560
someone to get a kind of a roving map of

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,110
the farm as well so whichever method we

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,630
use you can gather aerial imagery in

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,220
that way and then couple that with the

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,110
reading from the sensors that you do

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,540
have and then from that we can build

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,970
machine learning maps of the farm to

00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,430
measure the temperature the moisture

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,830
levels the pH levels all in areas where

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,080
we don't have sensors as well and we're

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,170
doing this mixing kind of conceptually

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,260
our model mixes two different things one

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:37,690
is the the spatial smoothness meaning

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,580
that two points that are close together

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,640
in the farm are gonna have fairly

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,650
similar values so the temperature you

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,690
know is going to be very similar when

00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,200
they're when they're nearby and then the

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,420
other thing is visual smoothness so if

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,700
an area was recently watered it's going

00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,640
to have this darker look to it and so we

00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,130
can see in a darker area in the farm we

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,840
may have it may be similar to another

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,490
one with a sensor that does have that so

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,670
those things all all work

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm conceptually so if we put this all

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,870
together then we have a great spatial

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,950
temporal view into our farm which can

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,110
yield all kinds of interesting

00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,670
agricultural services I focused mainly

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,110
on precision irrigation but there's a

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,730
whole lot of other work - I'd love to

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,640
tell you about but first let's come back

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,500
to the challenge of connectivity so we

00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,540
still have this this issue we can use

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:30,030
fewer sensors but how could we you know

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:32,290
better get that data up to the cloud and

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,400
there's a lot of different ways to do

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,140
these things right now there's a lot of

00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,900
different ways of moving data around we

00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,400
have RFID we have bluetooth we have you

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,230
know Wi-Fi

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,730
however there's issues with all of these

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:47,320
things so Cellular is a great solution

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,270
but if any of you who ever have ever

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,729
driven with your cell phone through a

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,650
very rural area you know that cell phone

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,860
coverage can be very spotty in in rural

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,919
areas and then there's also Wi-Fi is

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,830
also wonderful but it only stretches so

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,780
far right I know my home Wi-Fi if I go

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,699
you know literally across the street to

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,500
my kids bus stop to pick them up I'm

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,380
already out of Wi-Fi range of my home

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,479
network so how could we do this and so

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,150
we are experimenting with some

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,460
networking research and pioneering the

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,410
idea of television white spaces so

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,300
here's the thought behind it typical

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:25,150
Wi-Fi operates in roughly the five

00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,180
gigahertz range however if you think

00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,789
about television stations they actually

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,210
broadcast at a much lower frequency and

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:37,990
now those waves stretch a lot further so

00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:40,960
the idea is using unused television

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,479
channels to send data packets and

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,070
essentially create your own hotspot by

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,780
doing that now of course you can't just

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,979
start sending data packets over unused

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:49,840
television channels you have to work

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:52,780
with the local government and make this

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,340
said do it do it properly but this is

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,080
something that we've pioneered and it

00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,300
actually works quite well and it's

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,430
extremely exciting technology to me even

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,990
outside of the realm of farming imagine

00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,520
being able to connect to your home you

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,280
know access point from 10 miles away

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,080
like very very cool stuff and so we've

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,870
stood up a pilot of this in Kenya as

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,580
well as other areas and are doing a lot

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,310
of work in this research I'm even

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,620
outside of farming too so finally

00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:20,680
putting this all together we now have

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,870
used drones machine learning IOT and

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,419
some cutting-edge networking research to

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,030
give a real-time view into the farm and

00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:31,660
hopefully work closer towards that goal

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,070
of reducing world hunger there's a lot

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,950
of other stuff we're doing with machine

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,990
learning as well we have we're building

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,779
models to predict the best times to sow

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,099
and the best times to plant crops we're

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,380
also doing a lot of work around

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,450
precision pesticides I'm really excited

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,920
about that in particular because if you

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,959
can just apply pesticides where they're

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,430
needed that saves the farmer money

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,230
because they're you know spending less

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,900
money on pesticides which are pretty

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,550
expensive it helps with general health

00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,170
of everyone eating that food and it's

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,730
better for the environment as well and

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,560
then finally we're doing some

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,480
interesting stuff with low cost weather

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,190
station meaning one of the things that's

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,160
very important to measure is the wetness

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:11,050
of leaves and there's a sensor that does

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,610
that but it's fairly expensive but we

00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,460
found that if we actually use too much

00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,230
cheaper sensors the rain sensor and a

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,580
temperature sensor and then coupled that

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,560
with the machine learning model we can

00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,540
actually predict leaf wetness from those

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
two cheaper sensors as well so a lot of

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,780
other work in the machine learning realm

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,310
I have a whole bunch of resources on

00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,810
this I'm I did stick them all at one

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,670
link right there if you'd like to access

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,140
it further and then finally I just

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,810
wanted to close by telling you about the

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,390
AI for Earth program so Microsoft has

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,910
publicly committed 50 million dollars

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,980
over the next five years towards

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,320
projects that use machine learning and

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,890
artificial intelligence in the areas of

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,560
Agriculture water climate change and

00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,900
biodiversity projects like this so I

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,030
urge you my fellow machine learning

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,500
practitioners tell your friends and if

00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,410
you're doing work in this area please

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,750
apply for a grant and together we can

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,420
build a more sustainable future thank

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:07,130
you

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,130
[Applause]

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,029
