here's how we do it I'm gonna do a

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,480
little bit of neurobiology here so the

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,490
first thing is to decide what neurons

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,309
you're going to decode which ones you're

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,750
going to interact with we actually jump

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,120
from the brain into specifically into

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,190
motor cortex and we think about the

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,020
brain and motor cortex is giving us

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,150
here's this picture of a homunculus a

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,289
plan of how the brain connects into the

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,880
body which you'll notice there is that

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,769
your hands and your mouth sort of

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,359
dominate the output of your brain those

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,980
are the most densely innervated parts

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,480
your body our hand is actually the most

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,550
densely innervated part of your body and

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,480
that's where we collect our neural

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,420
signals this is where your skill relies

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,719
resides and this is where your

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,239
adaptation your online real time fast

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,910
adaptation is expressed and we do that

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,469
by decoding the activity of individual

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,789
neurons as they innervate your hands

00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,870
using an array of sensors and a

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,629
technology called surface

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,180
electromyography or surface EMG we're

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,640
able to actually take a complex signal

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,689
and deconvolve it in this case I'm going

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,130
to talk about something called mild

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,530
control and we'll come to that again

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,210
towards the end and under mild control

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,159
we're actually just trying to understand

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,189
what each of the 14 muscles in the arm

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,080
are doing when you're moving when you're

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,210
doing natural things that you do today

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,920
including the kind of unnatural things

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,580
you do when say you're typing or you're

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,350
moving a mouse or a joystick and in this

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,720
scenario we actually just deconvolve the

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,060
signal out into individual channels that

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,070
map out to muscles and once we have an

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,960
online map of what your muscles are

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,759
doing we're effectively aware of

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,110
everything you're doing with the machine

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,520
today if we can decode this accurately

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,670
then there's no reason for you to have a

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,320
keyboard or to have a mouse because I

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,880
have the information from the nervous

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,979
system itself that would have otherwise

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,630
been expressed through those devices so

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,329
little abstract but I'll show it to you

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,890
in some videos in a moment but from here

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,469
we do something that's much more exotic

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,100
from my control my own meaning muscle we

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:08,399
jump into neuro control and this is

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,390
pretty exciting and one of the first

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,980
places in the world you'll ever see this

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,110
the brain has upper motor neurons up in

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,030
cortex and those synapse down on to

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,420
lower motor neurons that exist in your

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,010
spinal cord those interns and long axons

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,890
the largest cells in your entire body

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,350
long axons down and contact muscle and

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,480
they released neurotransmitter onto the

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,209
muscle and they turn individual fibers

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,340
in the muscle on and off but you'll

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,560
notice here are three clusters of fibers

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,989
the dark blue ones the pinkish ones and

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,480
the red ones those are called a motor

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:45,330
unit and a motor unit has a one-to-one

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,580
correspondence with a motor neuron such

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,489
that when a motor neuron fires in the

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,220
spinal cord that final output signal of

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,670
your brain you get a direct response

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,459
what's called an action potential in

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:02,489
muscle and if we can dig inside of that

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,489
EMG signal we can decode the actual

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:07,590
neural signal and decode these action

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,570
potentials with action potentials we

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,060
have the zeros and ones of the nervous

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,690
system there is no information more

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,200
reduced than that and from there we're

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,200
off to the races

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,379
