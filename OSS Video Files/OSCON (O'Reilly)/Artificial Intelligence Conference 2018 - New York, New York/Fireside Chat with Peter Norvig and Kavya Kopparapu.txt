it sounds like you started the girls

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,379
computing league in part to help other

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,200
people have that kind of support that

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,670
you had yeah so to give everybody a

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,990
little bit of background I go to Thomas

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,080
Jefferson High School for science and

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,840
technology so I've had a lot of really

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,670
amazing access to a lot of different

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,369
technology we have 14 research labs at

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,279
school ranging from updates to computer

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:27,810
systems to neurobiology so we can

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,109
basically pursue any project that we

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,510
want and in the area that teaching or

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,980
Thomas Jefferson is in is an area with a

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,040
lot of title one schools and not a lot

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,370
of resources and I realized that here at

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,899
ej we have so many passionate students

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,789
about computer science why can't we

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,770
start a club one of these schools and

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,200
that's kind of how we started we've

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,489
expanded to the DC Housing Authority now

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,899
we have a full year kind of after-school

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,859
program we have summer classes and one

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,010
of the I guess one of the most rewarding

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,239
workshops that we've done is we actually

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,189
had a teacher professional development

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,780
workshop so teaching teachers how to use

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,490
computer science and integrate it into

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,780
their curriculum and I guess the funny

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,310
thing is that a lot of the teachers who

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,830
attended were not stem teachers there

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,090
were history teachers English teachers

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,119
who really wanted to integrate computer

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,189
science into their curricula so yeah

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,280
it's been a really amazing opportunity

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,750
we actually had because again I've been

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,060
able to take classes like artificial

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,799
intelligence at TJ we hold our own

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,229
artificial intelligence summit for high

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
school students and invited a lot of

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,680
speakers to come talk about their

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,119
research and hopefully inspire some of

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,630
the high school students to learn more

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,630
