hi I'm Paco Nathan from O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,390
we're here at AI new york 2018 and it's

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,790
my pleasure

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,200
tickets talked with jennifer Marvin here

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,719
I really enjoyed your keynote this

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,070
morning yeah Jennifer is principal

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,000
software development engineer at

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:19,020
Microsoft and I wanted to ask you about

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,150
in particular you were talking this

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,320
morning about AI for Earth program you

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,920
tell us a little bit more about that

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,170
absolutely so last December Brad Smith

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,970
who is the president of Microsoft made

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,210
an announcement at a conference in Paris

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:35,120
that Microsoft publicly committed 250

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,090
million dollars over the next five years

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,879
in grant money and cloud resources it

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,500
for support for projects in the areas of

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,090
artificial intelligence in machine

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:52,320
learning in the areas of Agriculture

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,899
water climate change and biodiversity so

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,340
those four key areas and using machine

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,879
learning to kind of solve some of our

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,739
global challenges and there's kind of a

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,110
number of things we want to do in that

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,610
arena so first of all is access right

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,799
just giving people access because I

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,689
think there's a lot of brilliant

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,520
environmental scientists and such out

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,710
there but if they don't have access to a

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,360
cloud to be able to compute the you know

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,310
massive amounts of data they can't

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,100
necessarily do you know amazing work

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,840
with the domain knowledge that they have

00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,250
and so part of it is just you know this

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,600
this grant money is intended to give

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,850
them access and get them started and

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,619
give them away to be able to use the

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,450
cloud to do some some really neat

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,380
predictive analytics and the like and

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,840
then secondly education so again a lot

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,090
of very brilliant people and if it's

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,829
it's the Bible neck is that they just

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,030
don't have a machine learning background

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,049
or don't know maybe have a machine

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,880
learning background but don't know how

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,470
to do it I'm a sure specifically at our

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
cloud then we want to provide

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,189
educational resources to get them up and

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,530
running so that they can do their

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,259
amazing work of saving the world more

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,509
easily and then finally innovation so

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,240
looking at you know what are the next

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,890
amazing you know things that we can kind

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,320
of raise up so we have a couple of

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,270
lighthouse projects people who are doing

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,540
particularly great work that we kind of

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,160
wonder

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,830
raise up and then make available to a

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,390
wider group of people so a couple of

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,310
things they are one of one such project

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:20,090
is the farm beets project that I write

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:23,700
so it's really exciting work using AI

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,230
machine learning and drones and IOT and

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,420
cutting-edge networking research all

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,250
together to try to work on the problem

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,590
of world hunger I mean being able to

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,770
grow and increase yield of farmers crops

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,450
so it's really really exciting work and

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,830
I'm really excited because I think we're

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:46,590
we're at this intersection right now of

00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:48,690
AI and machine learning is exploding and

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,670
then we have just a lot of global

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,320
challenges as well so being able to use

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,980
those together is really exciting

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,900
fantastic have you had a chance to to

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,010
work on the farms all with some of the

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,780
drones and some of this kind of

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,220
equipment yeah I played with some with

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,239
the drones for sure I've done some of

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,290
the drone stuff and there's actually

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,640
there's a whole lot of stuff they didn't

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,260
go into in the keynote that's really

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,270
neat around what they've done with the

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,769
drones just there's a lot of so one of

00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,739
the big challenges with drones - besides

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,470
regulations and cost is the battery life

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,150
like even the best drone it's gonna run

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,930
for like what 35 minutes or something

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,489
and then you're out and if you're

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,930
talking of you know thousands of acres

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:26,549
farms that's really hard to cover and so

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,690
we actually implemented an algorithm

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,190
where the farmer just has to take out a

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,080
mobile app and then they can select the

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,430
area and if they want the drone to sweep

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,049
or they can select the pad for it to

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,959
follow and essentially if it's sweeping

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,400
an area it'll actually use the wind to

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,500
optimize its path because drones

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,750
actually the the battery life actually

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,280
gets consumed more when it has to slow

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,840
down and stop you know or change

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,459
direction those kind of things just when

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,560
it's got momentum that that uses less

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,850
battery and so it actually uses the wind

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,060
like if you have a Jerome that's kind of

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,620
from you can lean on this way when the

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,470
wind is going that way and use the wind

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,870
to be able to propel it and then turn

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,519
the other way to utilize that drag just

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,650
slow itself down so that it's using AB

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,299
less battery as well so we kind of built

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,340
in some algorithms into the the drone

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,560
flying as well to try to optimize for

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,200
for battery life Oh fantastic well it

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,630
sounds like engineers from Microsoft

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:23,250
then are also helping to I

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:25,350
yes technology yes so Ranveer Chandra is

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,790
the principal researcher on the farm

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,260
beats project and he's the one who's

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,930
really owning that and driving it and

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,240
doing some amazing work in that space

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,820
and then there's another project on

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,530
project premonition and another great

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,420
Microsoft researcher Ethan Jackson is

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:42,480
leading that work and that's another

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:44,190
really really cool story where the

00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,580
problem that project premonition is

00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,520
trying to solve is the issue of trying

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,310
to predict outbreaks of disease before

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,440
they happen and so right now the way

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,790
that works is you know people get sick

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,290
and they go to the doctors and when you

00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,340
go to the doctors your doctor reports it

00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,360
to you know the Center for Disease

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,530
Control or the world tour it's

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,060
organization or there's these

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:05,430
organizations that kind of summarize and

00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:07,350
aggregate that data and then you can say

00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,820
okay you know an outbreak has happened

00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,140
we've seen a large number of people in

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,170
this area that are all coming in with

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,420
the same disease but that takes like two

00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,100
weeks to a month after the people have

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,690
gotten to it that that it actually is

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,550
known that there's an outbreak basically

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:21,900
yes we have an epidemic exactly after

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,910
it's happened and all that stuff so

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,530
project premonition is trying to predict

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,680
that before it happens and the way we're

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,260
always doing it is so cool so mosquitoes

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,910
mosquitoes are the cave so basically

00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,770
mosquitoes fly around and they cooked

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,500
blood from bears eggs from animals as

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,970
well as humans right and so there's some

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,550
amazing machine learning where you can

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,530
take we set up these traps these lures

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,450
and it's got this little it's this

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,560
little cylinder and it's got 64

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,030
individual little slots in it and bugs

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,200
can fly in and out of the slots and

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,610
there's these little gates here and you

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,410
have to have a classifier built on the

00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,270
gate so that when it recognizes that

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,070
it's a mosquito in their poop the trap

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,080
will close but only when it's a mosquito

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,270
so it recognizes the wingbeat pattern of

00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,460
a mosquito as opposed to a fly or B or

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,230
any other bug that could be in there so

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,300
then we have these mosquitoes and then

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,950
we can use a genomics pipeline to

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,440
reverse-engineer the blood that's inside

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,270
the mosquito to figure out what animal

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,880
it came from and what diseases that

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,950
animal had so you can use that

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,790
information to track okay a lot of cows

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,710
in this area have

00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,640
this out this disease and those kind of

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,230
things and it seems to be spreading

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,880
through this population and the same

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,740
thing with humans as well to kind of

00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,140
catch those things a little earlier and

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,700
be able to take um take a pet take

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,040
action against it so it's really

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,030
exciting work really exciting work well

00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,770
that sounds like a really good

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,050
application for say edge computing I

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,670
mean I can imagine some of the AI can be

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,620
moved out into the harbor right yes

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,300
definitely in both the Premonition

00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,160
scenario where there are these you know

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,870
traps in some of them were in the jungle

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,550
and all over the place

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,560
you know studying these things we also

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,030
have done some in Houston Texas around

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,980
the time with that go there so there's

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,360
been a lot of work to you know plant

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,440
these and then grab them out in the

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,210
field where they're doing this research

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,860
and same thing with the farms scenario

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,020
that I talked about this morning where

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,380
you're on the farm and so it is a huge

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,520
thing for edge computing being able to

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,410
you know get that information and be

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,670
able to compute the results like right

00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,290
there and make a decision whether or not

00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,390
to close trap or that sort of thing

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,030
right on the edge so it's very exciting

00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,760
stuff well I'm curious I mean out of all

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:26,800
these kinds of examples and it is quite

00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,890
a range but what are you learning about

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,200
how AI can be applied well there's

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,510
there's so many different things and I

00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,730
think the exciting thing is that we've

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:40,660
only gotten started so the announcement

00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:45,010
that Brad made was in was in December so

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,510
we're still so relatively um young as a

00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,530
program that we did some hiring after

00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,870
that so it's only been a matter of

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,690
months and we already have grantees in

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,240
over a hundred or over 100 grantees in

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,190
over 20 countries all stemming so there

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,110
there's definitely a need for this sort

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,850
of thing more of a need that than I

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:03,010
thought there was honestly that I would

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,840
have anticipated so it's exciting to see

00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,270
that there are so many people working on

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,860
such cool things and then some of the

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,700
things they're building and and how we

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,910
can how we can take that forward really

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:19,210
where where this got started was the

00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,100
idea of that we're in an age where

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,450
machine learning has exploded I mean I

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,820
got my degree in artificial intelligence

00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,650
15 years ago and we have to you know the

00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,030
field has changed so much in 15 years

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,320
that I'm always you know it's kind of

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,200
I'm not sure how much that degree was

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,550
really worth but it is it's that weird

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,020
such an exciting time for machine

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,220
learning the things that we've solved in

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,140
the last five years like machine

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,360
translation you know speech recognition

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,510
all that stuff just solved and 15 years

00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,400
ago when I got my degree that was art

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,830
wasn't maybe someday exactly exactly and

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,720
we've done it and the advent of deep

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,570
learning and just you know compute is so

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,250
cheap or compute is so much faster and

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,320
storage is so much cheaper that we

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,390
really are in a golden age for AI right

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,400
now and then couple that with the

00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,650
environmental challenges that our planet

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,650
is facing right now the concerns over

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:08,140
fresh water that concerns over climate

00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,240
change the concerns over the fact that

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,250
the way species are going extinct

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,190
exponentially like way beyond the right

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,230
that they should be so how can we apply

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:19,780
all of this amazing stuff with deep

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,080
learning to these big challenges of our

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,760
planet and it's exciting to see what

00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,260
some of our you know what some of these

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,140
grantees are doing and then how we can

00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:31,810
help enable that wonderful what you

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,820
mentioned I mean this is going on so

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,530
many different parts of the world is

00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,170
there any kind of distribution I mean is

00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,000
it focused in certain areas Africa I

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,260
think you were talking about yes so we

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,270
do have some work in Africa you can

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,760
actually go to our website and we have a

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,830
whole map of all of our grandchildren

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,900
saying yeah so you can look and so as as

00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,520
it updates and as new grantees come on

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,600
you're welcome to go check the website

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,430
and see where all the different things

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,530
are so there's certainly a lot for North

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,680
America we actually don't have as many

00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,960
in Australia as I would like but there's

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,360
yeah there's a pretty good amount in

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,660
Europe and Asia and then Africa and

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,300
India so it is fairly there's a nice

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:12,250
distribution all over the place but more

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,500
more people are always welcome wonderful

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,330
yes on that note - I mean for our

00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:19,300
audience there's a lot of practitioners

00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,470
more in this audience so what what our

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,980
next steps how do people get involved

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,930
yes

00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,490
well apply if you're doing any kind of

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,240
sustainability work so if they're doing

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,770
anything in in climate change water

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,200
agriculture or biodiversity they're

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,970
welcome to apply for a grant and take

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,250
advantage of some of that you know pot

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,690
of money to help you know

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,320
keep them keep them motivated and keep

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:44,020
them moving and then we also have a Geo

00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,120
a I data science a virtual machine so

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,860
that's something else that people can

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,720
definitely take advantage of it is um

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,950
the standard you know Microsoft data

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,600
science a virtual machine which is a

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,670
really nice virtual machine that comes

00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,380
with all of the deep learning frameworks

00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,580
and stuff already installed so you don't

00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,720
have to worry about setup and

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,550
dependencies and all that stuff you can

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,740
just be up and running in a matter of

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,300
minutes and so we have that data science

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,530
virtual machine and then we've added to

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:13,210
it a couple of like geo specific things

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:16,630
so specifically the geo I'm sorry arc

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:18,370
GIS oh that's a pro from ESRI um is

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,930
installed on there pre-installed in

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,200
there so you can do that as well as

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,790
several a land cover mapping tutorial to

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,650
see some of you know how you can make a

00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,320
prediction of given some satellite

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,590
imagery tell me whether this is you know

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,090
water is it trees is it fields what kind

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:36,370
of land is this urban development or

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,720
something that's not um plantable so you

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,120
can use that for a lot of interesting

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,860
scenarios as well DeForest trekking

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,300
deforestation and you know various you

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,640
don't we urban planning and stuff like

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,890
that a lot of very exciting things to do

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,390
so you can download that today or check

00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,130
that out today and then apply for a

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,360
grant if people are interested one of

00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,530
what will I encourage everybody to do

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,570
that I'm looking forward to doing that

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,839
yes thank you Brian for appreciate thank

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,839
