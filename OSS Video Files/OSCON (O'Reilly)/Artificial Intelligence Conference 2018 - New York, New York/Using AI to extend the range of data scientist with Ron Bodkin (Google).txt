hi I'm parka Nathan from O'Reilly Media

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,040
and we're here at AI New York 2018 and

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,160
it's a pleasure to get to speak today

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,080
with Ron bodkin your technical director

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,020
applied artificial intelligence at

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,670
Google welcome Ron thanks taco

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,650
nice to see you again Dave good to see

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,439
to you tell me a bit about your role at

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,740
Google sure so I'm a part of the CTO

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,810
office and our role in the CTO office is

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,250
to work both with our product and

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,769
engineering teams to make sure that our

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,300
products are really driving value to

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,160
have a big impact and to work with

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,320
customers to make sure that they're able

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,780
to leverage it and these capabilities

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,340
right so our focus in AI is really one

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,270
of the transformative things the 10x

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,129
opportunities that enterprises and

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,079
software and tech companies can achieve

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,390
and working with Google is specifically

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,949
working in Google cloud right so that's

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,809
the role excellent

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,120
so with machine learning and AI it's

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,340
really coming to the front and center

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,660
now for a lot of these discussions that

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,049
we're seeing especially when you get a

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,519
roomful of CIOs and CTOs together you

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,500
know what's your take on the general

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,310
state of AI in the industry yeah

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,930
absolutely

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,090
so you know the reason I came to Google

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,490
six months ago is because I'm so excited

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,430
about Google's leadership everything

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,880
from innovative research in Google brain

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,490
and deep mind and into Google cloud but

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,110
then also you know leadership in terms

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,509
of being very much in the front of

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,700
open-source development with tensorflow

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,829
some of the new capabilities and then

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,110
you know the underlying capabilities to

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,700
develop technologies like tensor

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,229
processing units and hardware right so

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,119
I'm very excited by the capabilities

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,799
that Google has and one of the things

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,860
that's really interesting to me is also

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
Google has been very much in the lead in

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,930
terms of applying these technologies in

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,579
our own business right so there's over

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,290
7,500 tensor flow models checked into

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,659
our source code control systems it's

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,310
being used across products you know

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,170
whether it be enabling new things like

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,780
Google assistant in Google home or

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,430
improving core products like the most

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,530
significant improvement to Google search

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,030
in the last three years has come from

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,220
deep learning model something we call

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,869
rank brain and likewise improving the

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,550
way that our ad system works and

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,630
YouTube's recommendations right so

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,920
Google's been applying

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,500
these techniques deep learning

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,270
techniques creating embeddings rights

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,640
are translating a lot of information

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,350
into dense information into dense

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
tensors that can be used for modeling

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,140
which is a big shift from traditional

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,660
feature building right so we've been

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,700
doing this it really took off in the

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,010
last three years and been AI first and

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,170
the company right and so maybe an

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:37,560
analogy you know when Google published

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,170
the first MapReduce paper in 2004 it

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,420
took you know seven to ten years for it

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,130
to become mainstream in industry so

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,500
we've been at this about three years so

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,840
if the same timelines apply you know

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,120
we're probably something like four years

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,890
away from it being mainstream but what

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,240
we're seeing is of course acceleration a

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,580
lot of interest and one of the things

00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,770
that I find exciting is how cloud can

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,830
really allow us to expose things like

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:04,920
the networking prowess that GPUs and

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,260
GPUs you know hosting models right so

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,320
that a lot of what is complicated to do

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,450
to really execute well on machine

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,700
learning you can rent in a cloud like

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,230
Google cloud rather than having to build

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,150
it on premise where there's a lot of

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,310
complexity so that may well accelerate

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,200
the adoption curve a bit right so we see

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,090
a lot of large enterprises coming to us

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,890
we have CEOs coming to thank Google how

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,940
can we take advantage of AI in our

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,560
business right we'd love to learn from

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,000
you and a lot of times we do start with

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,740
here are the things we've already done

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,570
that are working what are the analogies

00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,160
in your business well taken out a bit

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,200
further than given what you've learned

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,670
from these customers what kind of advice

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,650
do you have for the companies that are

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,030
that are early in this journey the ones

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,730
are just getting started with AI

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,150
adoption yeah so I'd say that you know

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,010
being successful in AI requires you to

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,410
have foundations of having your big data

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,880
organized and to be able to be a

00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,920
real-time digital company to be able to

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,990
act on that when you build models that

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,790
you can take action right so many

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:01,410
organizations have some housekeeping to

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,390
do they need to make sure their data

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,010
strategy is executing need to make sure

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,350
they build digital culture and

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,850
capabilities but I'd also say that you

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,830
know what we see is really important as

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,480
getting started right so starting to

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,959
look at what are the areas where you can

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,780
apply right so enterprises can build

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,669
capabilities in unevenly right so you

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,640
can have a pilot team that's applying

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:25,740
these new AI techniques to business

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,090
problems in areas where you have

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,470
digital capability and have organized

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,669
your data even if you have other parts

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,860
of the business that are still getting

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,630
organized on the data side right so we

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,610
think it's really important to pick some

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,139
low-hanging fruit get some pilots then

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,370
you're not really benefitting until

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,710
you're deploying things into production

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,599
right so it's super important to go from

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,940
testing ideas and saying hey this can

00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:47,490
work actually doing deployments and

00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,080
testing live in a real business process

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,060
that's where the real learnings come

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,590
that's where the real value comes so

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,930
doing it incrementally is really

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,069
important the other thing I'd say is you

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,069
know there's a range of options right

00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:01,080
one end is building custom models right

00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:03,360
and we provide not just open source but

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,940
tensorflow and and hosted services for

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,159
that and optimized processing but also

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,630
building blocks right so what are

00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,590
pre-trained models right taking

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,970
advantage of things like video

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,039
intelligence or natural language

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,349
processing building blocks in the cloud

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,580
that can be useful to integrate into an

00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,470
application without having to train

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,180
models and take specialized data

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,830
scientists you can do a lot with that

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,389
and one thing I'm really excited about

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,490
is something in between those two which

00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,849
is what we call Auto ml right which is a

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,880
way of making it easier to specialize a

00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,259
model take take the advanced development

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,169
of say a vision model that we've created

00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,030
but then give your own examples of the

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,340
kind of classes you want to classify and

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,080
then have it these so that analysts and

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,270
engineers can train state-of-the-art

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,180
deep learning models and into some of

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,099
these domains with this kind of transfer

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,960
learning and hyper parameter tuning and

00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,000
even our learn to learn research start

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,319
to make them work well for a specific

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,569
application without requiring data

00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,949
scientists the last thing we see a lot

00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:00,539
of organizations doing is saying hey we

00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,000
also going to take advantage of AI

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,550
that's built into our products right so

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,400
like Google AdWords has smart bidding as

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,560
an example or Google sheets has features

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,880
to make it a lot easier to visualize and

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
understand the data on your spreadsheets

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,520
right and the reality is enterprises are

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
gonna do all of these things they're

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,190
gonna have to build custom models

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,870
they're going to leverage building

00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,550
blocks to extend the range and

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,960
capability the data scientists and where

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,370
there are products that they can buy

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,080
off-the-shelf have those capabilities

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,250
take advantage of them

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,020
so we think you're gonna need to do all

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,460
of those things but the key thing is you

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,719
know getting those initial pilots

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,710
figuring out areas where you can start

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:35,339
to create business now even build

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,510
momentum now going back to cloud what

00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,430
are what are some of the ways that that

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:39,060
Google cloud platform helps to alleviate

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,320
some

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,270
the challenges you're talking about

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,340
machine learning absolutely so there's

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,860
you know across the board if you look at

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,710
when you are doing more custom model

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,230
development we provide ease of use of

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,210
spinning up machine learning

00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,920
environments right so with it's our

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,730
mission learning engine that make

00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,620
available

00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,210
you know tensorflow make available a

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,340
variety of accelerators like tensor

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,040
processing units are now in beta that

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:07,500
are have been the as I'll talk about in

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,690
my keynote tomorrow the the best price

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,510
performance result in Stanford's dawn

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,420
bench was posted by training imagenet

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,180
models with TP use right significant

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,980
savings so we see that as as well as the

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,990
fastest time to train those right so a

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,060
significant performance right so we

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,550
bring a lot of capability to making it

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,530
really easy to do custom then Ottawa Mel

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,120
is a major push we've announced Ottawa

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,070
Mel vision and we're developing

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,110
additional Ottawa male capabilities to

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:37,020
make smart building blocks as well as

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,520
building blocks API is ranging from

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,330
national image processing to speech

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,090
generation to to vision and video

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,410
intelligence and dialogue flow for

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,570
interaction in conversations as well as

00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,640
as well as you know providing a great

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,560
set of data tools right one of the

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,300
things that people often don't think

00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,890
about is it's not enough just to be able

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,080
to train your models but what's the

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,420
system right so we have really high

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,000
performance bigquery that makes it much

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,190
easier to organize and accessor data for

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,020
training you know we have data flow as a

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,120
data a streaming data processing engine

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,500
right as well as data proc for Hadoop so

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,420
we have a lot of great tools to

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,100
integrate to build systems and there's a

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,440
lot of work in tensorflow on open

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,570
sourcing more right so tensorflow hub to

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,640
have pre-built models tf-x

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,350
to make it easier to have end and

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,640
transformations and processing for a

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,740
machine learning system right all of

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,330
that is something that came from Google

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,370
and therefore you know Google Cloud has

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:34,770
you know first-class support and

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,090
capabilities excellent well out you know

00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,670
this is a wide range of different

00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,740
technologies what do you foresee is

00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,840
having the most impact for developers

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,750
and data scientists out of these yeah so

00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,970
I'd say that we think that democratizing

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,750
access to machine learning is going to

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,670
have a huge impact

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,500
right so Ottawa now making it possible

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,060
so an increasing amount

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,640
of what you can do with deep learning

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,130
models can be done without requiring

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,510
your specialized data science team to go

00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,270
and learn the latest state-of-the-art

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,800
research and deep learning and deep

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,510
reinforcement learning and generative

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,730
adversarial networks right we think that

00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,770
there's a lot of value in having smart

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,750
building blocks that solve 80% of the

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,610
problems without having to do that now

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,320
there's still going to be the hardest

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,930
problems where we add a lot of value and

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,520
the infrastructure tensorflow

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,170
continue to improve the way tensorflow

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,790
works thinking these are were things

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,280
like tensorflow eager some people can

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,870
prototype before they optimize with more

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,270
traditional tensorflow right so there's

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,340
a lot of capabilities there you know we

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,530
also do things like we've made available

00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,910
our collab Rhetor environment which is

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,980
jupiter notebooks with great

00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,660
visualization and easier to have a

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,330
hosted environment rights again pointed

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,160
at a GPU or a GPU and get accelerated

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,810
performance right so we think that

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,370
there's a lot of value there as well in

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,450
terms of how do you really do custom

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,550
models how do you go from research to

00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,800
application to deployment at scale in

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,360
the cloud excellent and you'll be

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,690
speaking tomorrow you're giving a

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,510
keynote and also session that's right so

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,480
doing keynote talking very briefly about

00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,740
what we're doing at Google and some of

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,180
these innovations that we're bringing to

00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,800
market based on our experience of

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,500
deploying deep learning at scale and

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,210
then a session on using AI for the

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,160
digital experience again talking more

00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,170
about what we're doing at Google how

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,970
we're applying deep learning and AI

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,040
techniques extensively and I need some

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:26,160
of our customers in Google Cloud and

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,070
some of how organizations like Spotify

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,820
are taking advantage of Google cloud to

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,990
improve recommendations an eBay for

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,270
visual search and shopping

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,920
recommendations for example Oh fantastic

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,120
I'm looking for your talk thank you very

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,120
