I see so I guess you know the the

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,960
content tagging and content search I

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,059
think other sort of the core problems

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,190
that you're trying to address now how

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,710
have you historically gone about solving

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,400
that problem yeah well I would say

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,250
somewhat unsuccessfully sad to say we

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,640
we've done a fair amount of of manual

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,550
tagging which you know is an important

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,890
part of the process but does not scale

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,740
so what we've tended to do is we've

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,700
selected a small you know part of our

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,430
catalogue and and done some more

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,980
intensive tagging on a case-by-case

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:43,200
basis we've also tested out some of the

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,879
black box solutions that are out there

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:52,230
that are you know sort of claiming to be

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,050
able to programmatically crawl video

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,559
content and expose all kinds of linear

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,780
metadata those experiments have been

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,699
really unsuccessful so far I see and

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,820
that's exactly how we started working

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,409
together so you know I think our teams

00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,780
started this work a little over a year

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,119
ago and started discussing how we can

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,619
bring AI to sort of solve this problem

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,840
now can you talk a little bit about our

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,180
collaboration specifically about how we

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,970
use machine learning and they I do look

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,189
at the content you know extract features

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,720
understand emotion and then drive you

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,700
know what are we using that for like so

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,310
driving the marketing of the content I

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,439
think in this case it was the friends TV

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,299
show yes can you talk a little bit about

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,060
how you're using AI there to sort of

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:39,840
improve your targeted yeah absolutely so

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,150
let's let's start from the beginning of

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,740
the problems that you know working with

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,380
you guys

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,420
is extremely helpful because you have

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,939
subject matter acts expertise you have a

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,009
lot of partnerships and we work together

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,259
across a number of different fronts so

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,530
there's good synergies that we can kind

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,229
of bring to bear the first challenge

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,350
that we had was creating the training

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,060
data set so friends long-running series

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,360
that degree had over three hundred

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,840
episodes there were 80,000 faces

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,230
described in these 300 episodes

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,379
who's needed to get tagged by talent by

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,160
emotion by intensity of emotion to

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,019
create the the training dataset and that

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,739
was a kind of a crowdsource model you

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:32,280
guys helped bring a great partner to to

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:34,680
that piece of work then we worked with

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,810
your data scientist to take a look at

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,569
the basically the shape of the data and

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,269
try and determine the best approach or

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:48,720
methodology for creating a programmatic

00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:51,180
model and after you know kind of be

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,000
testing and learning phase I think you

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,590
guys ended up with one model for talent

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,010
and a combination of five different

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,709
neural networks for the emotional

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,810
detection and intensity detection so

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,769
that's a lot of work and leaving out a

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,680
ton of different details but but that

00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,379
was a lot of what what needed to be done

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,920
foundationally after that we could run

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,160
the models against the catalog and what

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,880
we're doing is we're using the resulting

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,209
information to identify spots within the

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,950
linear content that evoke certain

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,190
emotions and then we're matching those

00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,260
emotions to core audience segments and

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,370
then we're testing basically the

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,769
strength of the impact of those emotions

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:44,579
driving intent to view intent to

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,650
purchase whatever business outcome we're

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:50,519
trying to drive through our marketing

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,150
activity and you know what we want to do

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,290
is we want to get more efficient at

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:59,790
creating relevant marketing messages to

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,250
the consumers and we want to be able to

00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:06,919
do it at a scale that we're simply not

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,919
able to achieve up till now

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:15,129
