Title: Beasts, Rhymes and Unit Tests - Bristol JS - October 2018
Publication date: 2018-11-20
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Presented by Tony Edwards.

Speech recognition is all around us. From the smartphones in our pockets to the devices at the heart of our digital homes, we’re never far from speech recognition technology. Not only does it enable new ways of interacting with computers, but it’s also set to reshape Human-Computer Interaction for people requiring assistive technologies.

The humble web browser is no exception. The speechRecognitionAPI enables developers to incorporate advanced speech interactions into today’s web applications. But is it any good? Combining two of his passions, Tony sets out to discover if the speechRecognitionAPI can be used as an aid in transcribing hip-hop lyrics during the writing process.

After an introduction to the broader technology, a mix of audio, video and live performance tells the tale of creating an MVP transcription application to aid in the writing of new songs. As a development project, each iteration of the app is accompanied by a set of unit tests. The final unit test is executed live, resulting in a crescendo you won’t want to miss.

ladies and gentlemen boys and girls and

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,180
friends from beyond the binary before I

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,220
go any further I need to do a quick

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,960
check now I've done about you but I've

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,420
had a 5-hour journey to get here today

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,950
you've probably all done the full day's

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,639
work probably feeling a little bit

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,460
sleepy

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,100
so let's check that everybody is still

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,019
wide awake so can everybody join in with

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,510
me for the final little bit of this

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,949
thing too just like we do at home you

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:37,079
know you know the bit we all do it that

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:41,070
way yeah you all look awake all of a

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,510
sudden so my name is Tony Edwards I work

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,160
in education outreach for an

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,620
organization called software Cornwall

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,840
which is a member network of 80 or so

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,710
businesses working collaboratively to

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,570
create a bigger voice for the call

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,100
nationwide I am also the resident

00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,559
creator of Awesomeness at future sync

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,039
events which includes the future sync

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,170
conference and the kuroda Meetup I have

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,939
been told that the statement creator of

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,390
Awesomeness has an element of the

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,909
dunning-kruger effect included within it

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,380
obviously I know nothing about that and

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,630
I found the level I got you giggling

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,009
with countdown but not with psychology

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,540
jokes good tonight before I go any

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,850
further there's two things I let need to

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,979
let you know first thing I've just

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,409
recovered from a cold so my voice is not

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,640
quite what it usually is so if you can't

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,909
hear me at the back at any point just

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,140
you know wave and I'll start speaking up

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:36,000
and I also currently have a chest

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,020
infection so if you have to listen to me

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,490
Hawking up a lung I apologize in advance

00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,710
secondly there is going to be a photo

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,280
opportunity at some point during this

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,290
talk it will come thick and fast and but

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,380
just follow my lead and it will be

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,000
absolutely fine now this talk is good or

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,229
that photo is going to be used as part

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
of the presentation I'm hoping to give

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,579
next year which is a TEDx talk so if you

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,759
don't want to be included in my TEDx

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,750
talk please do dive to the floor at the

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,750
appropriate moment

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,569
well your feet might be but your head

00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,400
won't be and that's the bit GDP our

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,819
cares but because I don't want to have

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,849
to tag you all info and so yes so that's

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:21,280
the notices mate so what is tonight's

00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:23,410
talk all about so I'm looking to answer

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,200
three questions about the web browsers

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,720
speech recognition API service and the

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,910
first question is can you use the speech

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,450
recognition API for the transcription of

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,510
the spoken word to do that we'll need to

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,640
define some terms speech recognition is

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,829
an everyday technology I can pretty much

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,280
guarantee everybody in this room has it

00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:47,829
in their pocket right now 40% of adults

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,620
use it at least once per day and of that

00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:53,590
40% 60% of those who started doing so in

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,930
the last 12 or so months for us as

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,970
developers that means it's a huge area

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,120
of exponential growth that we can start

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,310
using in our apps more importantly it

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,980
opens up the web for people with

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,069
visibility issues people who can't see

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,500
either colors or specifically words at

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,230
all I've used this technology of

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,660
somebody who has a vision of a piece of

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,989
their thumbnail at the end of their arm

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,130
and using speech recognition technology

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,560
they were able to find out bus

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,319
timetables for themselves for the first

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,489
time in 22 years now as a developer

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,130
community I'd like to think that's

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,350
something that we would all like to

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,060
proliferate around the world speech

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,519
recognition is comprised of three

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,160
elements the first element being the

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,849
recognition of individual words the

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:46,420
second is a neural network like

00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,669
dictionary database and the third is an

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,329
understanding of language and how words

00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:54,549
link together in order to create meaning

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,380
for this technology in browser we are

00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,840
only really dealing with the first layer

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,120
and that is recognized in individual

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,150
words you're taking in very raw audio

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,700
waveforms like you get from a microphone

00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,310
on your phone or whatever we chop it

00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:13,120
into small pieces and it tries to

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,700
identify which phoneme was spoken in

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,959
that last piece of speech so phoneme is

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,279
the kind of primitive unit for

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,680
expressing words

00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:26,080
[Music]

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,570
and then it will want to stitch those

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,410
together and into likely words like Palo

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,210
Alto these is that in the first person

00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,220
this talk I had about 10 minutes to

00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,660
explain that but thankfully Google spent

00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,550
hundreds of thousands of pounds creating

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,360
that video I thought it'd be rude not to

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:45,760
include it fundamentally in a browser it

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,560
is a dumb technology there is no real

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,090
intelligence behind it although the

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,090
devices that you have in your pocket

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:55,870
they are AI powered essentially but it

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,550
is a dumb technology the API is part of

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,560
the broader web speech API which

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,590
includes speech synthesis which is

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,599
turning text into speech and that was

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,630
written in 2012 by two people who work

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:08,889
at Google now no web dev web dev talk

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,410
would be complete without browsing

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:13,510
compatibility chart here is ours for the

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,699
evening and as you can see is only

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,570
actually Chrome derived browsers that it

00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,580
works it it does work behind within

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,979
Firefox behind a couple of flags and a

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,300
bit of voodoo magic but Chrome is

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:29,620
essentially the only place that it does

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:32,740
work which is a shame so let's look at

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,840
this project specifically code wise and

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,840
Adam asked me to include extra code for

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,220
this code wise how do you do it so first

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,289
up we check and see whether we've

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,030
actually got speech recognition enabled

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:44,740
in browser behind the WebKit flag

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,340
because you know it's a blink browser

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,220
makes sense and then if it is available

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,979
we instantiate the new object from there

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,020
we are exposed twelve event handlers and

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,849
four of which are used in the app that

00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,870
I'm going to show you tonight the start

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:04,090
error and and result once we've

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,190
instantiated the object we can then

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,409
start recognition based upon a user

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,650
action in this case we're listening for

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:15,130
the click of a button and then starting

00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,780
the transcription when we get our

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:21,470
transcription back we are given a

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,139
Saltz object and the results object has

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,120
is final flag and then depending upon

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:29,030
that flag you can choose whether it's an

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,220
interim or a final result the interim

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,710
result is it before it's kind of gone

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,139
through some of those AI processes

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,210
although it's not really AI it's just

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,720
effectively gone to a lookup to see if

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,610
this is an existing phrase or if it's

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,210
the final transcription that's done and

00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,160
you can start using putting user

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,300
niceties onto it like capitalization and

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,860
that kind of thing it's a super easy API

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,960
which is good because it is a dumb

00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,480
technology you don't want to hide API

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,760
for that so how do we get this project

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,770
started well much like the video earlier

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,140
on we head over to Google and steal

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,740
their code stole the video steal the

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,630
code and J cite it is such a basic app

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,490
that I created using this as a starting

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,010
point made sense

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,720
so once you've claimed it you can

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:19,669
navigate into the project directory and

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,890
if you're using the code that I've got

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:24,710
you can just go up start it and then

00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:27,470
you're given this lovely interface and

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:31,040
as you can see it transcribes

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,479
the spoken word which means we have an

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,880
answer for our first question

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,789
can you use speech recognition API for

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,360
the transcription of the spoken word yes

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:43,430
you can't good times

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,140
brings me on to my second question can

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:51,289
you use it for the transcription of

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:54,650
recorded hip-hop lyrics all of a sudden

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:57,050
the microphones there anyway so this

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,150
project started out as a way for me to

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,400
transcribe hip-hop lyrics during the

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,229
writing process I have a bit of a

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,660
background as a rapper and I'll dive

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,580
into that a little bit later on but in

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,140
the meantime I feel like it's only fair

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,180
that we test this question with some

00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:15,470
examples and if we're going to test it

00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:17,630
we need some unit tests so for all of

00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,110
these tests the method I've used is to

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:24,229
route the microphone audio back in as an

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,419
output through my laptop so that the web

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:27,860
browser that you saw earlier on can pick

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:31,879
up what I'm saying through the

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,610
microphone I'm looking for an 8020

00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,130
if it transcribes 80% of what I'm saying

00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:39,409
successfully that comes back as a

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,479
successful test for me I know when I'm

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,789
dictating into a Google document if I

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,980
get 80% back the last 20% it's super

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,920
easy to put in any less than that it

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,680
becomes a pain now like I say we do need

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,810
a web or a unit test and for this one we

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,329
are going to call it the G unit test in

00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,390
honor of hip-hop's most successful yet

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:01,430
terrible wrapper and we're going to

00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,890
conduct a few tests and this is where

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:06,949
you the Bristol Jas audience get

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:11,149
involved with this talk are the looks on

00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:13,250
your faces if a test comes back as a

00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,500
pass and hopefully they all will I would

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:18,079
like you the amazing audience in front

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,560
of me to give me a big collective cheer

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,110
so we're going to practice that now just

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,060
so that you know what a cheer is right

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,560
so I'm going to count down and after

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,870
three I want one big cheer from

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:36,440
everybody so one two three no you

00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:38,269
wrapped it nice form and if it fails and

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,329
unit tests never fail did I mean never

00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:43,339
and but if it does fail I would like a

00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:47,149
big sigh from everyone just pretend that

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,339
you're fed up of crowd participation as

00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,199
if such a thing could happen okay so

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:56,329
again I'll count you down after three a

00:09:51,199 --> 00:10:00,380
big sigh collectively one two three yeah

00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:02,630
it's brilliant so we're going to run a

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,760
bunch of tests afterwards we'll get our

00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,920
expected results or our lyrics in this

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,360
case compare them against our actual and

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,459
then decide whether it's passed or

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,820
failed and that means it's on to the

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:22,799
first test

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:22,799
[Music]

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:36,830
Steve now by sheriff hands is there

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:40,010
anybody in the audience called Steve no

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,480
oh one hesitant hand at the back is it

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,610
you that the flight of the conchords has

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:49,190
a problem with I win if I have a catch

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,930
over them maybe maybe not the search

00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,350
continues for that pain in their

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,360
backside so that was the flight of the

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,279
conchords with a classic hip hop pop hip

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,110
hop a Potamus versus the rhinoceros a

00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,600
song I'm sure doesn't need an

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,690
introduction here are the expected

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:11,000
lyrics from that section and when we run

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,460
our unit tests we can see nothing to

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:19,040
come back and you know how that means

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:21,890
crow don't you so after 3 1 2 3 bad

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,029
times what problems have we got

00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,950
so there were beats in that song and as

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:29,720
you heard in the video earlier on we're

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,510
looking for the peaks and troughs in an

00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,160
audio waveform now those beats are

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,380
naturally interfering with those peaks

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,410
and troughs so we need to remove those

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,150
so I put my music GCSE to good use

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,550
and I eliminated as many of those beats

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:46,430
as I can I got it down to about 80%

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,560
removed with 20% interference left I

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,260
would say still go for that Pareto

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,880
principle but for the purposes of

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,370
tonight's talk I've left the originals

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,610
in because they sound awful even though

00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:02,839
you can hear the voice more secondly

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,480
they were not rapping in a US accent and

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,010
that is the default for this API

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,260
thankfully we can set that using our

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,320
language attribute and here I've set it

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:16,330
to English us which matches the next

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,330
example the closest

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,779
tell me if you did

00:12:47,609 --> 00:12:52,749
so that was a rapper cord snow the

00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,989
product with a track called unorthodox

00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:59,290
I'm and in that song she's talking about

00:12:55,989 --> 00:13:01,899
her struggles of being a female entering

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,029
the rap industry and more specifically

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:06,759
being a Mexican FEMA entering the rap

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,799
industry now she highlights there there

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,629
is a couple of ignorant dumbass men who

00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,220
were holding her back and I'll leave it

00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,600
to you to decide whether that is what

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,669
we're finding in the tech industry at

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,049
the moment I'm certainly not qualified

00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,049
enough to say that whether it is or not

00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:26,889
so on to our unit tests here are

00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:28,749
expected lyrics now these lyrics are a

00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:31,629
great example of the algorithmic

00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:33,879
properties of hip-hop there is a lot of

00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:36,489
tricks used to make the words in that

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,410
rhyme while she's rapping buy me a beer

00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:41,230
at the after party I'll tell you all

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,269
about that but I've really done

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:48,759
half-tones dive into it now so let's run

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:51,459
our unit test absolutely nothing's come

00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:55,739
back bad times and you know what that

00:13:51,459 --> 00:14:00,489
means crowd after three one two three

00:13:55,739 --> 00:14:02,649
yeah I wasn't expecting that to fail so

00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:04,989
much to be honest when I started what

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,970
kind of thing so it was quite a complex

00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:10,119
song and as I say I emphasized words in

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,189
a specific way to create rhyme and she

00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:13,809
also has an unnaturally nasally tone of

00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:15,759
voice when she raps and that's not one

00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:18,699
that she has when she's speaking maybe

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,679
that's causing a problem our next song

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:21,579
should definitely limit these things as

00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,709
much as possible

00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,730
speaking of which on to the grandfather

00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:26,730
of nerd hip hop

00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:43,290
remember rifle the Braille really well I

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:45,299
can recite it right now and head you

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,009
ROTF lol I got a business doing websites

00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,129
with my friends in some code you do they

00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:55,949
call I do HTML even make a homepage for

00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:57,929
my dog now I am definitely white you

00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:01,230
could probably call me nerdy a kinda

00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:04,519
wear that badge with honor that said I

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:08,609
have never made a home page from my pet

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:11,609
but my cat does of does have his own

00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:14,399
hashtag maybe that is the modern

00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:16,230
equivalent anyway you might have noticed

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,029
that there was a lack of results in the

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:20,100
top corner and we can confirm that with

00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:22,019
our unit test here are our expected

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,059
lyrics which I'm sure many of you are

00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,059
familiar with and when we run our test

00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:34,790
nothing but I'm gonna count you down

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,790
I'll just give you a wave this time so I

00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,669
didn't think you'd be so up for this

00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:43,049
thank you very much so it's quite a fast

00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:45,089
song that will again just like the

00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,910
others we've seen that is my flavor of

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:49,649
rap and if it doesn't work with

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,239
fast-paced songs there's no pointless

00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,850
project work in it at all because that

00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:55,589
is the style of rap that I perform and

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,319
as we'll find out later on that's the

00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:00,540
style I need to transcribe it is worth

00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,759
noting that he does use autotune in that

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,129
song or something similar to Otto Qing

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,319
and maybe that is interfering enough

00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:07,799
with those peaks and troughs to cause us

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,669
a problem

00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,739
who knows maybe just maybe it's a

00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:17,429
problem with the English language maybe

00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:19,280
it will work better with another one by

00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,700
Gillis turn me in

00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,920
[Music]

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,010
which servant and collection diva does

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:33,350
was ever mark ever practiced fast don't

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:33,350
dish dish dish with the Messner up him

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,390
every tough given this talk I've tried

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,910
to keep a straight face that point

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:45,540
doesn't happen so there is a pumpkin in

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,490
a [ __ ] mask for our Halloween fee so

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,460
that song is called grossome tourists

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,770
right so gratin is an area in Austria

00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,860
where they speak German I'm assuming

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,630
tourist is tourists now I come from

00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,670
Penzance on West Cornwall we get an

00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,880
awful lot of tourists um I have never

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,740
seen anything like that but if that's

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,770
your bag head over to cross them you

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,180
might just have a good time and it's

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,339
worth noting we saw a young woman run

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,130
down an alley away from somebody it all

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:14,810
ended up good there's nothing to worry

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,940
about that

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:23,089
but we got no results back unfortunately

00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:23,089
and you know what that means don't you

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,280
you really are starting to sound like

00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,080
you're fed up a crowd participation now

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,640
so foreign languages didn't work either

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,410
and ultimately by this point I'm

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,780
beginning to lose faith in this project

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,160
as a whole I'm definitely coming around

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,290
to the idea that this is a dumb

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,030
technology or at least I'm pretty dumb

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,790
for thinking I could use it in this way

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,160
but I was willing to give it one last

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,490
try before turning the whole project and

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:53,190
for the last attempt I decided to use an

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,590
acapella track to eliminate any remnants

00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:00,300
of beats and so that it's as unfiltered

00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,930
and unedited as possible yo if they got

00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,210
chains

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,710
I got aim so be living in the middle of

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,660
the lane and it think it's strange then

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,190
I'm playing but it feels quite right to

00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,510
be sane I've been locked down to the

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,370
lounge and I can't get a route to be

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,750
proud of I'm living in code everything I

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,450
plant in the ground comes back to me now

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:21,030
how stylish I'm feeling in vogue we got

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:24,790
some results oh yeah oh don't hold on

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:28,390
things are beginning to look up but

00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:31,360
before we can cheer we do have to look

00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,930
our unit tests so here are our expected

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,970
lyrics

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:37,930
notice the vague mention of code in

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:44,170
there just to piggy key when we run our

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:46,330
unit tests we've got words it's better

00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,830
than we've had before and in fact some

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:52,120
of them are actually match up with what

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:54,760
he was saying fantastic unfortunately it

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,650
did cut the song off about two lines

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,840
from the end which has lowered our

00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,990
average and I put it somewhere around

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,000
45% which does mean it's a fail

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,430
unfortunately so hopefully for the last

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:13,060
time this evening can I get the biggest

00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:14,230
sigh from everyone one two three it's

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:18,040
the last time you'll be signed but that

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:20,260
is not the highest left participation so

00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,750
it did present some solutions some

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:25,150
potential solutions if we start with a

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,310
row a cappella with no beat at all it

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,920
should work and the areas where it

00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,470
didn't transcribe very well is where it

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,240
was the rapper was using extended words

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,250
so he was extending the words to fit the

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,900
rhyming scheme it doesn't like that

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,570
seems and that makes sense when we think

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,270
about how it analyzes words well

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,800
unfortunately another fail we've got to

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,380
the point where the question we have to

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,340
answer and I'm afraid it's going to be

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,410
in an O for that one bad times but it

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:56,410
does bring me on nicely to my final

00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,570
question can you use speech recognition

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:02,410
API for the transcription of performed

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:06,580
hip-hop lyrics got out my voice all

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:09,220
right so earlier on I set us all up some

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,130
cheering and some sighing and so far

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,430
we've only had a sign and I want to

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,080
correct that balance and leave us all

00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,960
heading out of here tonight on Halloween

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:25,480
with a little skip in our step a little

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,120
joy in our hearts no no you're just

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,000
looking at me like no okay so we've seen

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,740
all of our unit tests fail so far so

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,520
it's only fair that we deploy our code

00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,430
into production

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,300
because that's what we're to write with

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,980
one final live test so I mentioned

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,620
earlier on that I'm a big hip-hop head

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,530
so in a past life I used to do some

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,380
rapping and I had a whole bunch of stuff

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,180
up on YouTube and SoundCloud but I took

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,000
that down the moment I applied for a job

00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,500
working in education they frowned upon a

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,350
rap career in that industry

00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,480
never mind and I used to do a bunch of

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,340
geeks so the last two gigs I did all

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,080
three gigs I did one at a place called

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:09,100
the white rabbit in Plymouth which

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,330
closed down two weeks later I did Warren

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,460
at a place called the Voodoo Lounge

00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:15,250
which coincidentally closed down two

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,840
weeks later and earlier on this summer I

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,350
rocked up to Toys R Us and did a little

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,140
impromptu gig guess what happened there

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,390
so hopefully zone will still be open in

00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:29,680
two weeks time for the next Meetup time

00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:33,040
will tell now growing up I used to dream

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,410
of that eight mark rap battle audience

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,080
that kind of environment hands up we've

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:41,650
seen eight mark there's enough of you

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,300
yeah there's enough of you so I used to

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,750
dream of being up on that stage in the

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:49,660
bow rap grounds proving my worth to the

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,570
audience and I'm hoping you as an

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,240
audience can help me get one step closer

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,650
to achieving that dream tonight just in

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,070
case you're not familiar with what a rap

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,200
battle audience looks like here is one

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,200
[Applause]

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,990
[Applause]

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,730
are you lookin so notice how into it

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:18,429
they are they're written everybody's on

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:23,840
their feet they're bopping along yeah

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:26,929
that looks like a crowd having fun now

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:31,399
I'm confident we can get you there even

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:32,510
if you're not and the audience were

00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:35,480
really into it and it was that energy

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:37,460
that gave the MC the confidence and the

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,429
ability to kind of shine in that moment

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,770
they feed off of the audience now I

00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,450
think we can't get you there and I see

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,309
some down the faces in the audience but

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,000
thankfully I've come prepared to bribe

00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:52,250
you so when we look at the eight mile

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,820
crowd and our typical and developer

00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:58,010
audience we can see a couple of minor

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:03,320
differences and when we look a little

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:05,630
bit closer at our web dev crowd I did

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,190
wonder I did wonder you'll probably see

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,080
the obvious difference and it's so

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,419
obvious we don't need to make a big

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,090
point of it there's a serious lack of

00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:16,580
hats in this room there is a serious

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,130
lack at I thankfully I've come with a

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,140
big bag of hats you've got a lot heads

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,620
and we need to turn you into that crowd

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:27,980
this is a thing made in heaven right no

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:31,000
okay so me and Adam are going to come

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,440
and dish out some hats in a minute and

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,490
start warming you up into that eight

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,490
mile like crowd

00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:52,140
I go pass them on here for so

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,280
unfortunately the witches hat gets in

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,570
the way the microphone that's why I

00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:04,290
can't wear one right so just follow my

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:09,870
lead and everything will be okay okay

00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:11,400
can we get some puppet yeah pretty you

00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:18,270

00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:23,890

a friend the man the diva Frankie is

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,730
afraid of what the fans found if they go

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,980
into my mind to try to own one Idol the

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,780
cobwebs our heads line with run I'm a

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,940

like a clang bang I'll replace the paint

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,890
paint something like this frame rates 20

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,690
yes you run if you don't gotta play the

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,370
brain games from the cat salon the

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,410
[ __ ] box below I'm rather than the

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,090
government a part of the new Inca may be

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,530
but suppress our wishing you could black

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,330
out wishing you could take it back but

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,919
it's too later back yep probably better

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,799
anyway there will not be witness

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,169
immortality fatality fatality try to

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,480
meditation after the medication every

00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:31,190
building Nazi recent renovation play you

00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,600
to the ground with the King Kong pound

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,640
but your people bounce around like a

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,350
ping-pong round suspected I'm Dyslexic

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,880
little sailor gone the whole church Tai

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,390
Chi for the records I'm another lovely

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,390
monster

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,680
so stay on your feet so that photo

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,810
opportunity is just about to come up so

00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,820
if you don't want to be in that photo

00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:55,740
now's the time to dive to the floor

00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:00,300
maybe people at the front cacao a little

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:06,000
bit what site you all know right just

00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:08,150
follow my lead like we did before hey

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,160
[Applause]

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:18,180
awesome you are awesome thank you very

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:19,500
much you could take seat now so be

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,740
honest I'm surprised I got through that

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:25,110
whole thing with the chest infections so

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,000
here are our expected lyrics quite an

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,000
awesome set of lyrics I'm sure you'll

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:36,930
agree but more importantly how was our

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,780
unit test reacted to this it's matched

00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:42,210
some impressively his reducted

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:46,130
gangbanged shows there's some

00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:48,030
intelligence happening in this and but

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,300
although there's a lot of matches

00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:53,190
it's generously about 55% so there was a

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,690
point at which all I stopped to take a

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,230
big breath where there was the finish

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:01,320
him sound effect over the top and that

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:05,160
is where it has stopped transcribed and

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:08,100
unfortunately bad times it's probably

00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,450
about 55% match against what the actual

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:15,990
lyrics are which does mean it's a fail

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:19,230
but I wonder if you the amazing web dev

00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:22,670
crowd can pander to my ego and give me a

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,670
pass for this what do we reckon

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:30,700
I mean it's tough because I've already

00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:34,150
put the sound effect in so after three

00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:40,750
can I get a picture from everybody see

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:43,450
three yeah so what have we learned if

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,190
anything stay you can use speech

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,850
recognition API for the transcription of

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,679
the spoken word tic you can't use the

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,330
speech recognition API for recorded

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,950
hip-hop lyrics although there were some

00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,429
solutions are I think we could get it

00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,840
working but we didn't and you can kind

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,670
of use it for the transcription of

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,500
performed here pub lyrics if the

00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:07,480
audience is in your corner now that's

00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,640
pretty much all I've got but there is

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,210
one thing I would like to finish with

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,500
today now I call this a dumb technology

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,330
a couple of times throughout this talk
