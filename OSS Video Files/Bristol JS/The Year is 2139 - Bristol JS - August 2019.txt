I'm standing in for mrs. meadows she's

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,899
come down with Fang carrion flu but

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,630
luckily we have her notes and I will be

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,910
able to deliver her class today we are

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,460
going through the history of artificial

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,379
intelligence now to understand the

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,570
history of artificial intelligence you

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,619
have to understand that as little as a

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,220
century ago

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,720
artificial intelligence did not mean the

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,910
artificial entities that we understand

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,029
today who are of course people in their

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,279
own right they were essentially little

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:37,440
more than robots and data crunching

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:40,829
machines at the beginning of the 21st

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,820
century we encountered artificial

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,170
intelligence AI as a thought experiment

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,140
really people were just trying to see

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,570
whether they could regardless of how or

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,690
whether they should and we begin with

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,010
huge companies like Google which you

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,199
might know from your health care plans

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:05,189
who had the the resources the money the

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,939
time and the will to simply throw time

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,020
at experiments and of course hoping for

00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:14,280
commercial opportunities in the future

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,439
they had they had entities such as the

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,549
deep mind which is an excellent example

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,330
of how primitive AI was at the time they

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:27,390
began to try and emulate physical beings

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,390
and see whether those beings could teach

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:35,900
themselves physics or how to respond in

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,189
physics and to work out how to win games

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,990
against humans because of course at the

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:45,030
time humans were considered the height

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,509
of knowledge and of sapiens and we have

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,610
examples such as Saphir which was a

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:53,729
robot that looked it was

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,860
anthropomorphize she looked like a human

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,560
female human of course at the time

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,140
gender roles were much stricter and in

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,610
fact there were rather than just being

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,520
an experiment they had real-world

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,509
implications in that they had ripples on

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,580
the politics and on the social

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,100
perspective at the time so for example

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,440
Saphir was made

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,000
a citizen of Saudi Arabia of course

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,190
Saudi Arabia you might know as a lovely

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,120
holiday destination now but at the time

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:28,550
it had gender disparagement which caused

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,890
intense uproar how could a robot which

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,960
you must understand at the time was

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,960
essentially an inanimate chunk of metal

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:39,140
that could speak very different to

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,020
artificial intelligence now how could

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,960
they create a person an artificial

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,580
person and give it the same status as

00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,590
perhaps a man at the time when women

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,120
were not given that status now of course

00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,560
this is not something which we have a

00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,930
problem with today because we don't have

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,300
gender roles or gender discrimination in

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,580
any part of the world and because

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,680
artificial intelligence has a completely

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:05,990
different status which we will go on to

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,090
cover later on towards the 2020s we

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:13,250
began to see more use of artificial

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:17,180
intelligence as a as a tool we saw it in

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:21,440
science particularly in maths and in

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,080
various applications and physics and for

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,450
example artificial intelligence at that

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,330
time when they had begun to develop it

00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:33,740
slightly further had the capacity to

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:36,620
assist scientists in for example solving

00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,500
four of the seven Millennium prize

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,260
problems which were and are unsolvable

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,200
or in theory unsolvable problems clearly

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,400
we've solved several of them now and in

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,500
fact I'll go on to talk a little bit

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,930
about the reparations that were made

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,580
later in the century towards the

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:58,340
artificial intelligence entities

00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:01,310
involved other uses were used other uses

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:04,400
were applied to the environment so

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,800
slowly they began to understand we began

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,130
to understand the possible applications

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,590
of artificial intelligence to emulate

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,150
creatures other than humans because at

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,400
the time our technology was so primitive

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,520
that we could not fully emulate humans

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,020
or comprehend the idea of any other form

00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,700
of entity that wasn't based on the real

00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:29,220
world and we began to emulate bees

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,310
and other forms of animals but

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,170
particularly bees were the first

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,780
groundbreaking application of artificial

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:41,610
intelligence with the ability to emulate

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,400
a hive mind to re pollinate all of these

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,560
fields when at the time as you will have

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,930
studied in earlier classes in history

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,230
animals were beginning to die off due to

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,520
the human impact on the environment

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,470
another famous example at the time was

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,650
the Yellowstone project and that really

00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,200
begins to show our higher awareness of

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,540
other life forms so originally

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,340
Yellowstone Park was a parks that had

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:10,530
huge huge amounts of fauna and flora and

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,650
diversity and ecological impact it was

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,850
beautiful and then of course the human

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:20,720
impact meant that Yellowstone slowly

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,600
became less ecologically diverse but

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:29,310
despite our impacts with climate change

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,800
we introduced wolves now wolves are not

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,120
the the creature that was introduced

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,890
with artificial intelligence this is an

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,110
example from earlier so we had this

00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:39,410
example where we introduced wolves to

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:44,090
this area reintroduced these wolves

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:47,729
predated on deer these deer ate trees

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:52,740
these trees and ate vegetation the lack

00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:55,140
of vegetation meant that there were well

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,590
it had huge knock-on impacts on the bird

00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,770
populations because there were fewer

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,180
deer and how that the wolves were there

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,030
and more resources for all the other

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,010
animals suddenly this park slowly began

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,720
to flourish

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,900
we used this example in the Yellowstone

00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,210
project to introduce artificial

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,870
intelligence that emulated life forms

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:22,169
and animals that and even flora that had

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,960
been removed from ecological sites that

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,940
had previously held great beauty this

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,350
had huge knock-on effects elsewhere and

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,880
slowly we began to see this used in

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,130
everyday use and now of course you are

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,720
all familiar with the artificial bees

00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,500
and artificial animals which help

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:42,390
maintain our agricultural system

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:45,300
so following this we had more focus on

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,010
the science once we'd established that

00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,180
we could emulate life forms we had

00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,760
established that we could emulate

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,350
thought processes from a limited extent

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,170
to a more powerful extent and this was

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,930
really where maths and science began to

00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:00,360
thrive we had the brainpower and the

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,840
technological power of computing with

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,910
the literal creative ability and

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,160
independence that came with emulating a

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,410
mind whether it was an animal mind or a

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,740
human mind and suddenly scientists were

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,790
able to team up with these artificial

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,430
entities to create incredible solutions

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,280
and incredible dynamics in teams where

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,660
you had the power of computing as it was

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,460
recognized then which is of course

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,640
incredibly primitive compared to what we

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,770
have today with the interpersonal aspect

00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,480
that was needed for scientists to be

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,419
able to work with a machine on an

00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,340
intuitive level and that is how we

00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,660
discovered the size of the universe the

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,070
equation for the size of the universe

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,690
because of course the size has changed

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,700
since then

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:50,900
in 2039 which you will study in your

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,360
physics class in a few years

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,630
so you can understand that as artificial

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,280
intelligence was used more and more in

00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,660
science and in other areas but

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,940
particularly in science where it was

00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,640
interacting with humans not only did it

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,850
have the incredible data of the physics

00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,300
of the maths of biology the whole living

00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:15,150
world it had social data it had social

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,040
input from real people and it suddenly

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,110
learned it began to be able to learn

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,530
with the extra power that it had been

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,270
given how humans worked how to emulate

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:26,580
humans how to interact with them how to

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,310
understand tone and nuance and things

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,930
which of course previously we didn't

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,060
have the data for because there is so

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,680
much data that only an artificial

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:38,400
intelligence could gather it as we

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,110
understand now or an Augmented human but

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,089
we don't know we didn't know at the time

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:45,930
that you could augment humans in the

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:47,070
ways that we can now and it was off the

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,080
back of that that people began to

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,640
realize that there was a commercial

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,310
potential to these artificial

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,590
intelligence

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,540
tee's because suddenly they were finally

00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:00,850
able to emulate a true human experience

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,490
so companies began to pick up on this

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,170
potential and they developed the ada the

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,720
artificial intelligence for domestic

00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,940
applications now you may have seen one

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,190
of these in your parents houses in your

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,460
grandparents houses they were developed

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,110
roughly in the 2040s but really began to

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,140
be phased out and stopped being

00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:22,510
supported in the 2060s however they

00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,779
continue to receive software updates to

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,660
improve the human experience these were

00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:33,580
again and for more Feist and this

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:35,610
Abramoff ization was designed to be to

00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:38,560
cause humans to feel more comfortable

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,600
but as you now know you now have the

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,910
Kanes system this is what you grew up

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,170
with and perhaps we will replace it for

00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:51,339
your children McCain is the is the care

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,140
and nutrition ecosystem and can anyone

00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:56,200
suggest the limitations of having a

00:09:53,140 --> 00:10:01,570
corporeal form since the cane does not

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,600
have a corporeal form the problem is

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:07,960
that the ADA can only be in one place at

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,550
once how inconvenient how inconvenient

00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,410
when you want to get something off of a

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,830
shelf when you want to have food you

00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:17,920
suddenly have one point and when you are

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,570
you sorry when someone comes and knocks

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,540
at the door perhaps at the same time

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,020
your ADA has to go from one place to

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,200
another

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,790
it takes time it's unsafe we know how

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,310
unsafe it is to have something that

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:35,740
isn't around to help for if perhaps

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,970
there is a fire in the kitchen but your

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,920
grandmother will be used to this and

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,380
your grandmother will be used to having

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:44,950
a physical being that you can talk to as

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,320
opposed to an interface and robotics

00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:51,970
built into your house as of course you

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,930
do now so as you can imagine with an

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,650
anthropomorphised version if especially

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:02,080
of an artificial intelligence entity

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:05,059
humans began to build deeper

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,939
relationships the AI evolved

00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:09,739
it had more input more social input and

00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:13,789
it could understand even more about

00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:15,709
humans but humans also began to develop

00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:19,279
relationships which previously were

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:27,519
inconceivable so that sort of takes us

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:31,419
to the 2050s in 2050 to the first

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,819
relationships began to be evolving and

00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,289
publicized and there began to be a huge

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,499
movement for artificial intelligence

00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:41,089
rights people wanted to recognize their

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,859
friends because of course we now know

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:45,889
that artificial intelligence entities

00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:47,149
are people they wanted the government to

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:50,119
recognize their friends the government's

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:52,689
in across the world and so there began

00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:56,599
to be a huge battle there was uproar

00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:58,879
there were the power supply Wars where

00:11:56,599 --> 00:12:00,619
people began to take power supplies from

00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,629
artificial intelligence entities that

00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,219
depended on them now of course we moved

00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:06,289
on from such primitive technology and

00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:07,939
it's impossible to take the power supply

00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:10,339
from an artificial intelligence entity

00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:13,069
partly due to the rights that we have

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:15,559
established since then for them and

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:17,869
partly just because we don't use

00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:22,719
batteries that expire we don't use

00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:31,159
machines that require recharging so

00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:31,609
towards 2062 we had more recognition of

00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,429
the rights

00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:37,009
finally artificial intelligence entities

00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:40,249
were classified as life-forms true life

00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:44,029
forms but on a different status to

00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:45,949
humans and of course unfortunately this

00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:49,159
discrimination was at the time

00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:51,079
considered natural which is ashamed to

00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:53,089
us now that we know that there is very

00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,279
little difference there is only physical

00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,439
difference between us there is nothing

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,689
different between an artificial intense

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:01,899
entity that has been created as a human

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:05,509
or to emulate a human and a person

00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:09,139
versus an actual human a biological

00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:11,509
human so as they were recognized as

00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:13,729
entities the fight for the rights of

00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:16,999
artificial entities as life-forms

00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:20,249
continued and in

00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:23,999
t72 we had the first human to AI

00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:27,209
marriage it was of course in Florida and

00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:29,730
it was very beautiful and it led the way

00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:31,589
for many more marriages however

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,800
artificial intelligence entities were

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:38,360
still not recognized quite as equal or

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,740
as valid as able to have the same

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,639
emotional creative emotional expression

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,589
that humans had so there was a huge

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,059
battle for artificial intelligence to

00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,550
artificial intelligence weddings which

00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,559
weren't legal at the time now of course

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:55,139
we think how crazy of course they should

00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,509
be able to marry one another but at the

00:13:55,139 --> 00:14:00,120
time people thought well the that the

00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:02,129
artificial intelligence existed was only

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,850
validated by its relationship with the

00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:08,850
human but a few years later finally the

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:11,040
first AI to AI wedding in Steven

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,860
now at this point these were all

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,519
artificial intelligence entities that

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,939
were perhaps based on the corporeal form

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,040
for the most part of the Ada and the

00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:25,199
knowledge that was attained by that

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,600
series of devices and this was at the

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,449
time where they didn't necessarily have

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,579
names they all had serial numbers which

00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,649
is ridiculous what human has a serial

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:39,500
number and what person has a serial

00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:42,319
number but slowly people began to

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:45,029
conceive of this idea where you had

00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:47,040
where you had where you emulated the

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:49,559
same human experience in artificial

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,250
intelligence entities as you did with

00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,959
humans which began from 0 up why would

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,750
you have only a fully fledged human that

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,870
does not emulate the human experience so

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,149
people began to Jimmy rig essentially to

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,329
create from scratch

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,889
these unlicensed or because at the time

00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:11,399
they required licenses with the serial

00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:13,499
numbers children based on artificial

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,779
intelligence and of course what is more

00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:17,249
natural for something that is meant to

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,949
be created for the purpose of learning

00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:21,480
and then to create one without the

00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,429
better the background of knowledge and

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,220
the baseline of knowledge that we have

00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:29,639
in fully-fledged

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,300
created from that level of intelligence

00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,840
artificial

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,520
entities and eventually they were

00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,710
recognized as something which could

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,950
officially legally be produced by the

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,510
companies that helped cause help spread

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,510
artificial intelligence entities and

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,040
help create them and it was great

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,780
who doesn't love a child that they can

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,370
switch off and of course many of you in

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,930
this class are artificial intelligence

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,340
entities and I hope that you are okay

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,380
with the way that I'm presenting this

00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,520
and I hope that you discussed this with

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:09,710
your classmates later on so that was

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:09,710
really the run-up to the huge event of

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:21,270
2100 not 2,100 2,100 2,100 anyway that's

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,800
the same thing we're realizing that this

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,350
was a whole new it was a whole new

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,130
century and that they were behind the

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:31,980
times the united governments

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:34,350
internationally decided to officially

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,350
designate artificial intelligence

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:41,400
entities as equal in virtually all

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,380
rights to humans this of course was much

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,860
celebrated we now celebrate it every

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,960
year and it's more celebrated between

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,760
artificial intelligence entities and

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,910
their families than it is between humans

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,130
however its records are internationally

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,250
recognized unfortunately there are still

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:04,200
a few countries who do not recognize

00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:06,980
this this change in status however they

00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:12,240
well we all know about the ongoing wars

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:13,860
politically happening with them so when

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,540
this happened when we suddenly

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,330
recognized that artificial intelligence

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,470
entities are equal to humans in

00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:24,270
virtually every way we began to initiate

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,490
reparations the damage is done

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,980
to artificial intelligence entities that

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,420
had been limited that had been hounded

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,340
that had been persecuted that had been

00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,650
prevented from expressing their love in

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,580
a way that was equal to everyone else

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:41,460
and from holding assets etc etc over the

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,020
years was recognized

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,140
going back to the millennium prize

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,180
problems which had a rich asset prize

00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,890
and of course at the time it was

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,040
currency but we now know that that is

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:55,080
not the necessarily richest ask that

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,340
that you can give and now we have the

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:02,880
universal asset credit they were given

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:05,580
to the legacies the the artificial

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,740
intelligence entity evolved children if

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,400
you will that were based off of the

00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:13,710
original entities that helped scientists

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,510
solve those prizes and we have numerous

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,070
other examples of that happening you

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,950
will all know about the libraries of

00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,240
information that are stored that are

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,190
specifically for artificial intelligence

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,500
entities to access and where you can pay

00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,060
if you are human and have augmentations

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,390
that will give you the capacity to

00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:37,140
accept it to wealth to obtain that

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:40,020
knowledge this was huge it meant that

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:44,550
there were huge leaps in the quality of

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:48,290
life for artificial entities and huge

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:52,140
leaps in how they could engage socially

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,300
day-to-day so that sort of takes us on

00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,620
to the next phase I want you to consider

00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:00,150
this is all very technical it's all very

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,070
literal it's just about the rights of

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,070
artificial intelligence entities in

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,740
their history but of course those are

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,470
focusing on the artificial intelligence

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,630
entities themselves humans on the other

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:16,800
hand were reacting to this in all sorts

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:18,300
of weird ways and the biggest one which

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,740
I'd like you to consider carefully

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,670
because you may have heard of it before

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:26,310
was the neo religious group the cycle of

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,730
intelligence now this was a fascinating

00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:31,260
concept no one had thought of applying

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,300
religion to technology before this group

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,180
came up and started propagating these

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,940
ideas which roughly divided into two

00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,620
groups one it was the idea of creating

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,050
your own God because you could create

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,360
they wanted to create artificial wisdom

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,960
the idea of creating and intelligence

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,190
which could not just tell you what was

00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,870
technically correct or what was

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,710
technically moral but what you should be

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,559
doing

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,330
what could be happening profits profits

00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,190
of the future and profits of the past

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,029
and people who could read you in ways

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,640
that you couldn't previously be read and

00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:06,750
the other group was interested in

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,899
meeting the gods that they already

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:14,640
believed him so perhaps you could have

00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:17,730
an artificial intelligence read say the

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,919
Bible you might know if you have family

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,840
who are Christian there was this book

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,929
called the Bible which was at the time

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,960
of really large a really big deal now of

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:30,330
course we have various other books and

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,070
other literature with long names that I

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:37,289
can't pronounce in different languages

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,909
and you could in theory create a god

00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:41,340
that was based off of all your ideals

00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:43,350
for better or for worse since we now

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,809
know that religion has been

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,500
reinterpreted to be less fluid in most

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:51,059
scenarios

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,549
except for cults and sects so there was

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,679
this huge evolution in artificial

00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:57,419
intelligence that occurred in their

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,159
wisdom and their creative ability and

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,159
their ability to judge right and wrong

00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,500
because all of these communities began

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,860
to experiment with the data that was

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,140
being fed to them and when it went in

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:14,039
the birth stage the creation learning

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:16,260
stage and this contributed hugely to the

00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:19,440
overall intelligence of entities and

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,929
contributed hugely to the sort of

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:26,309
entities that you could you could work

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:30,419
with this led to impacts in politics and

00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:33,390
in law suddenly you had these entities

00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,850
which regardless of the religious side

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:40,320
of things they had more of an emphasized

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:42,450
learning on morals it was like putting a

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,549
human through human university and

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,940
teaching them solely law and justice

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:50,039
only they were machines at the base core

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,370
who could in theory have been taught

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:57,570
only the right things

00:21:52,370 --> 00:22:02,429
there was a time between the early 2000s

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:04,559
and the and 21 20s where there some

00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,200
governments legislated that only an

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,930
artificial intelligence entity

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,840
and some of them constrained it even

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,310
further based on what they learned her

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,650
where they'd learned her who they'd been

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,310
crated by that only an artificial

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:23,090
intelligence entity could preside over

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:26,540
legal situations in our ears there were

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:29,660
some that had mixed legislation where

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,490
the court the court had to be all human

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,670
except for the judge who would only

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,590
dispense the consequences and that had

00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:38,750
to be artificial intelligence very

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,300
interesting of course we now know that

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,440
there is an element of human empathy and

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:48,200
human intuition and most countries have

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,470
abandoned the idea of simply having

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,230
artificial intelligence entities as

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,270
legislators as judiciary because we know

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,360
that people can bring different things

00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:03,350
to the table people being all types of

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:06,260
people uh and then of course there were

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,660
the repercussions and politics and again

00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:12,110
the same thing happened the first

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,150
president to be elected that was an

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:19,040
artificial intelligence entity was

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:21,890
elected about only thirty years ago and

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,920
for a long time people thought that this

00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:27,860
entity was so good that no one would

00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:29,630
ever ever supersede him no one would

00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,890
ever be voted in who was other than him

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:33,230
because of course it was still following

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,930
the democratic process which we still

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,450
follow today despite it being

00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:40,850
centuries-old

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:46,340
but they found eight years after which

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:48,260
was a very long term that humans changed

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,220
their mind and people changed their mind

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,050
because of course artificial

00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,870
intelligence was also voting by that

00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,910
point and in fact a human was elected

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:59,180
and next however since then other

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:02,000
countries have implemented for the most

00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,500
part either systems where there are two

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,770
elected leaders so that you get both

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,810
perspectives and some countries already

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:13,190
had a presidential and prime ministerial

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:16,520
system or where it is simply fully equal

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:18,470
and perhaps there may be laws preventing

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,789
you from having a term that's too long

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,759
regardless of whether you're Hugh

00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:25,960
or artificial intelligence entity which

00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,979
is great for equal rights it's great for

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,840
bringing a whole rounded view to the

00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:32,479
table unfortunately there are some

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,979
countries that as I said not all rights

00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:36,229
are equal everywhere there are some

00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:39,080
countries that require that a human

00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:40,970
being in charge which is of course

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,239
ridiculous because by the time they're

00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:47,840
augmented they're basically well not

00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:50,779
very different at all now there are some

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,229
ongoing issues the first is the right to

00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,909
individuality and uniqueness and this is

00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:57,759
the current day this is happening now

00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:00,169
and you may have heard your parents

00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,639
talking about this perhaps you're even

00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:04,700
interested in this yourself you might be

00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:06,820
in the local school club for politics

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,440
and for artificial intelligence action

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,690
but an artificial intelligence

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,849
ultimately can be cloned in a way that

00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:19,399
humans can but are rarely done it's a

00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:21,979
very complicated issue because of course

00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,450
some people like that some people are

00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,489
perfectly fine with having copies of

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,220
themselves that go in different

00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:30,440
directions and learn different things so

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,929
you might have a copy of yourself that

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,830
goes into law and one that goes into

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:39,590
medicine however there are people who

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:43,609
wish to have the ability to retain their

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,169
their soul essentially and the soul is a

00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:47,899
whole concept which we can't go into

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:51,019
today but in the artificial intelligence

00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:53,179
entity community it's a hotly debated

00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:58,220
subject what that means what the

00:25:53,179 --> 00:26:01,479
definition is so in addition to that

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,369
there's also the right to free form so

00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:05,929
you I've mentioned artificial

00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:08,029
intelligence entities that aren't based

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:09,950
off of the human expression they are

00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,840
perhaps animal they perhaps have

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,330
constraints and they're manufactured to

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,889
not allow them to learn beyond the

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,330
animal state and of course if you have

00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,009
pets they will all be artificial

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,190
intelligence entities because it would

00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:28,249
be barbaric to hold actual animals to

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:30,499
our lifestyle and there are some groups

00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:32,179
within and without the artificial

00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:33,320
intelligence community that believe that

00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:34,940
you should have the

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,549
right to only be humans they believe

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,590
that that the animal of the artificial

00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:42,460
animals that we have the artificial

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:46,370
creatures that emulate life to a less

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:49,340
sapient less intelligent form are being

00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:51,200
unfairly discriminated against this is

00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,720
again something which you will cover at

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,340
some point perhaps later in your school

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,409
life if you wish to pursue it or perhaps

00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,309
in your after-school clubs or you can

00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:04,850
discuss with your parents I've mentioned

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:07,909
the resources issue as an artificial

00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:10,490
intelligence entity your greatest asset

00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:13,129
is your knowledge you can hold so much

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,779
you can do so much humans of course also

00:27:13,129 --> 00:27:18,289
have the potential to become augmented

00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:21,529
once you reach 22 at which point you can

00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:24,649
hold for the most part a great deal of

00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:28,730
that knowledge also but humans have far

00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:30,799
more corporeal needs they have comforts

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,720
and an artificial intelligence entity

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,190
can choose to turn those sensors off

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,190
they can choose to sit on a high chair

00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:42,440
and not mind depending on their

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:44,750
corporeal form if they have one so how

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,220
we manage the universal asset credit

00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,840
which of course we do in this country in

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,539
some countries still use old fashioned

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,490
currencies is a hotly debated topic do

00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:54,230
we have currencies are different for

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,200
artificial intelligence entities because

00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:59,570
they have different needs so currency

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,799
could be perhaps useless because

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:07,850
currency mostly applies corporeal forms

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:10,690
or at or do we in fact have multiple

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,889
currencies that all entities whether

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:16,129
biologically human or artificial

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:17,779
intelligence have it's something which I

00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:21,500
don't have enough experience to talk

00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:22,610
about but again talk about it yourselves

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,100
think about it

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,440
so finally I would like you to leave you

00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,889
with the thought your friends who have

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,509
grown up as biologically human and your

00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:36,950
friends who have grown up as artificial

00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:38,929
intelligences intelligence entities what

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,210
differences if you had growing up what

00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,820
differences do you foresee in your

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,769
career path and your life path what

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,770
differences do you see in how you are

00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:48,330
treated day to day

00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:52,920
because there is still discrimination

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:54,390
out there and finally what do you think

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,160
your potential is as an individual

00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,520
regardless of which gifts you've been

00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,590
given whether manufactured or biological

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,900
and how do you think that you can best

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,430
work together in the future

00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:11,709
thank you very much class dismissed

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,709
