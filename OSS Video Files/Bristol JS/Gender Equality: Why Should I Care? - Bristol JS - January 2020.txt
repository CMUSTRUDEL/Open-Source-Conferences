	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
so I am here to answer this question why

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,220
should I care and answer all your

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,759
questions about gender equality that you

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,190
don't dare ask before I start I want to

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,490
tell you a bit of a story of why I'm

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:22,170
giving this talk today so not so long

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,960
ago at my previous workplace I witnessed

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,810
a male associate in a leadership

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,060
position get visibly upset because our

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:33,059
company had put on a special lunchtime

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,110
event to celebrate international women

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:43,680
in engineering day yeah yeah I felt that

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:46,410
too so he kind of asked in our open plan

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,600
office space pretty loudly why are we

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,559
still doing this surely we're past this

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,600
now you know surely we we no longer need

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,550
to celebrate women separately to men

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,609
this is such a shame I thought we were

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,609
over this what would happen if I created

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:04,650
an international immense international

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,979
men in engineering day how would that go

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,200
down so yes it was quite a bold

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,380
statement to make in an open plan office

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,240
and it was even bolder because he made

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,400
that comment while sitting next to a

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,270
female engineer who had spent much of

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,159
her career campaigning for women in stem

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,619
so stem being science technology

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,979
engineering and maths so she spent quite

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,930
a lot of her time after work doing

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,400
events for women in stem and she was

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,979
very passionate about the topic and

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,590
everyone knew this so the whole room

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:43,439
turned to this woman waiting for her

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,549
response and you could tell she was

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,970
getting ready to unleash she was getting

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,979
ready to unleash and say probably

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,969
thinking of what rebuttal she was going

00:01:52,979 --> 00:02:00,659
to make and you could kind of see her

00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,369
face blush yes so she she was about to

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,610
say something right so everyone looked

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,439
at her she took him this deep breath and

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,899
then very disappointingly the next thing

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,480
that happened was that she just let out

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,269
a big sigh and nothing

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,709
that came out of her mouth so what it

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,560
actually happened was in that very

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:21,140
moment she realized she didn't know the

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,049
answer to the question she'd spend her

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,360
eight-year career working on promoting

00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:28,670
women in STEM yet she couldn't answer

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,680
this simple question why is this still

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:35,360
an issue today and why is it a problem

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:40,069
we need to solve so even though there's

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:44,150
all this hoo-ha and fuss about getting

00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:45,410
more women into stem the average person

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,959
still doesn't know what the actual

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,140
reason is and in fact a lot of the

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,349
experts don't know either

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,150
so you may or may not have guessed that

00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:00,489
the woman in that story was actually me

00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:03,950
and the man in that story was my boss

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,019
not long after that conversation I

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,940
realized that this was something that I

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:12,260
really wanted to dedicate my life's work

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,500
to and it was a cause that was yeah

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:20,180
worth me stepping away from my

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:21,049
nine-to-five job to work on full-time so

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,060
this is me

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,030
I'm Tiffany Dawson founder of Tiffany

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,720
Dawson coaching and although I don't

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,630
have a background in tech my husband is

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,459
a web developer that is proper flexible

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:38,720
working right there he is on the road

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:40,340
he's always the developer together we

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,919
own two beagles

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:49,489
that's Alfie and Pippa there and I am a

00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,930
personal development book nerd those are

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,690
just the ones I've gotten hardcopy I've

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,919
got heaps of them on my Kindle as well I

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,660
don't actually generally like reading

00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,209
but I only like reading personal

00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,650
development books another thing about me

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:05,329
is that I'm obsessed with coffee this is

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,370
an actual screenshot of my throne

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,139
gallery when you search coffee at the

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,870
top and this is just the first page you

00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:14,150
can scroll down a bit more as well

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,910
and I think that is a result of me

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,579
coming from Melbourne Australia where

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,169
coffee is life there it's very hard to

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,169
come across a bad coffee in that city

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,199
so my career has consisted of eight

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,409
years as a mechanical engineer in the

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,930
building industry and during that time

00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:38,210
time and time again I saw all these

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,389
brilliant women leave their engineering

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,520
jobs from the outside it looked like

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:46,550
they were leaving because they were off

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,580
to start families but I knew all these

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,440
women better than that I knew they all

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,970
had one thing in common which was that

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,389
they were no longer fulfilled in their

00:04:52,970 --> 00:05:03,530
jobs so that is why I'm so passionate

00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:07,099
about this topic because the average

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:10,210
person doesn't actually know the reasons

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:12,949
behind gender inequality in STEM today a

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,979
lot of people feel like they can't

00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:19,039
actually ask questions about it because

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:21,620
they fear they might sound dumb they

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,349
might sound insensitive they feel maybe

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,120
they should already know the answers but

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:29,090
if no one's ever taught them it's not

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,819
their fault for not knowing so I'm on a

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,590
mission to change this and if you want

00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:36,080
to join me there are some things in this

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,389
talk today that can help you so I'll

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,520
start off by talking about the current

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:43,909
gender balance landscape in the tech

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,469
industry for the UK why does it matter

00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:48,800
so what benefits can we gain from

00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:50,719
achieving gender equality the big

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,529
question why does gender inequality

00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,240
exist

00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:56,270
yes I've done my research since that

00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,039
conversation with my boss and then some

00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,080
simple actions you can take away from

00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:05,150
today that you can implement tomorrow in

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,550
your own workplaces and lives does

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:11,960
anyone does anyone want to have a guess

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:15,520
as to what percentage of women exist in

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,520
the UK tech force today

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,640
close it's a little bit lower than that

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,550
so it's 16.4%

00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,450
of the UK tech sectors sector workers

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,390
are women out of the UK program is in

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,510
software developers in the UK only 12.5

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,000
percent are women so we've actually got

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:44,270
a pretty good gender split here today if

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,520
we're to reach gender parity in the UK

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:52,070
we would need to hire 1 million women

00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:54,110
into the industry and if you as sad as

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,290
me and love to read gender pay gap

00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,230
reports you'll see a very common pattern

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,480
emerge which is that the higher up the

00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:06,140
leadership levels you get the lower the

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:08,540
percentage of women now some of you

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:11,630
might be thinking 16.4%

00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,070
is not a great figure but you know we've

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:20,150
made some headway in the last 10 years

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:22,130
surely wrong in 2009 just over ten years

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,360
ago we were at fifteen point seven

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:29,210
percent women in the UK tech force 2018

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,330
we did go up a little bit and then in

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,850
the last year we've dropped again

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:37,460
so I think comparing those numbers tells

00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:42,770
a good story that the UK tech sector

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:45,470
needs to do a lot more work before we

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,320
all agree to put their time and effort

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:52,520
and money into doing this work we need

00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:55,690
to understand the benefits of it so why

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,220
does gender equality actually matter

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:00,380
here are just a few reasons to start you

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,030
off there are plenty more available as

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:09,440
well so it's quite well known that there

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:12,440
is a massive skills gap in UK tech I was

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,060
talking to you a couple of year the talk

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,970
who were in charge of hiring you

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,150
candidates for your companies and most

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,280
companies failed to fill all the spots

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,520
that have got available with the tech

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,169
requirements they've got I think there's

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,300
something there was a study done

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:33,690
recently saying about 89

00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,550
percent of UK tech companies aren't able

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,190
to fill all the spots they've got

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,800
available so we literally can't afford

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:43,320
to lose any women

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,470
this also has wider implications so

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,820
obviously individual companies they're

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,410
not reaching their full potential if

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,890
they can't hire the amount of people

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:57,570
they need but it's also a concern of the

00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:01,530
UK government Accenture did a study

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,170
recently to say that if we don't fix the

00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:07,650
tech skills gap in this country we're at

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:10,140
risk of costing the UK GDP by at GDP

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:15,570
growth by a hundred and forty-one

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:19,110
billion pounds so we are on track to be

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,600
falling behind other countries diversity

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,310
of thought equals better problem-solving

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,210
there's a whole bunch of studies that

00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:29,430
have been done to say that a homogenous

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,380
group of people and a diverse group of

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,680
people they've been given the same

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,660
puzzle to solve most of the time the

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,750
diverse group will solve the puzzle

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,800
quicker with less mistakes and with more

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:45,990
innovative solutions so the reason

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,870
behind this is that when you work with

00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:52,230
people who are not like you you're more

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,090
likely to ask questions when you work

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,770
with people you're like you kind of

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,540
almost can guess what they're thinking

00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,760
so you don't bother to ask those

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,860
questions so you are at risk of making

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,560
more mistakes and you don't come up with

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:09,740
new ideas as often I caught up with a

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,180
friend recently who I knew from

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,640
University and he spent most of his

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:19,980
career working in the automotive

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:24,150
industry his team was tasked with

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:26,100
designing a family car and as a bunch of

00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,710
mechanical engineers there are about 20

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,550
people in his team and only one of them

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,970
was a woman very luckily for them that

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,650
woman also happened to be a mum and she

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,650
was the only one who could bring out the

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,300
issues like but what if there's a nappy

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,100
explosion in the back seat what would

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,470
happen then

00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,329
she also mentioned that previous cars

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,509
that she had owned while she had young

00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:53,790
kids that had very flimsy cupholder

00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:57,240
handle arms so you know they got ripped

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:59,639
off by kids all the time so she brought

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,949
a whole lot of value to that team just

00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:07,170
by being different okay

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,779
shopping so none of you here will be

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:14,339
surprised that women hold the biggest

00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,120
buying power in the UK but the figures

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:18,420
might shock you

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,060
so women influence the decision of 92

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,449
percent of holidays 65 percent of cars

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:29,519
93 percent of food 91 percent of home

00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:32,100
and 61 percent of computers so guess

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,769
what if you don't have a woman in your

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,139
team you could be opening yourselves up

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:39,329
to blind spots for spotting new trends

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,370
for services or you might like the

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:48,209
ability to create a product that a woman

00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:50,639
wants to use staff engagement so you

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:54,050
might be surprised to know that staff

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,579
engagement for all staff including males

00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,670
increases when you reach closer to

00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:02,040
gender balance we all know that an

00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:05,130
engaged worker is a happy worker someone

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,870
who feels motivated to do things that

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,579
are above and beyond their own roles

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,589
they take less sick days they're more

00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:15,990
efficient a lot of benefits there and

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:18,870
because of all these reasons above when

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:22,649
you have more women in your leadership

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:26,310
teams your company experiences increase

00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:27,870
revenue so after knowing all these

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,529
benefits right now I'm going to pose a

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,949
question to you on a scale of one to ten

00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,449
ten being yes definitely and one being

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,540
no not at all

00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:42,540
how much do you want to improve the

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:46,889
gender balance in your workplace so keep

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:49,139
that number in your head the big

00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,040
question why does gender inequality

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:53,240
exist

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,440
a lot of people will tell you that

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,800
inequality exists because

00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:03,370
there are less women in the pipeline

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,160
they get paid less than men women just

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,880
don't want to work in stem while these

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,550
are all true unfortunately they are just

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,950
symptoms of the real reason so in order

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:18,040
to answer this question I need to take

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,340
you on a journey through history we

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,440
won't go too far back just 45 years ago

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:27,280
was when the sex discrimination removal

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,970
Act was passed in the UK before this

00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,250
time it was completely legal and it was

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,600
normal to discriminate against a woman

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:40,270
in training education and employment I

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:43,690
spoke to my friends mum recently who

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,310
about this topic and she said yeah this

00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,760
is exactly what happened when I was

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:52,180
working it was very normal for me to

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,340
enter the workforce equal with a man I

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,110
would definitely get paid less than him

00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,120
and it was expected that he would get

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,490
promoted above me no questions asked

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,020
that was just the norm that wasn't that

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:07,360
long ago that's about one and a half

00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:09,250
generations ago few years later women

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,370
could finally apply for their own credit

00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,370
cards and loans before that they needed

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:19,750
a man's permission and signature to do

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,180
so really not that long ago and this

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,750
last one is kind of not really that

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,840
useful I just think it's funny women

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,510
couldn't yeah people working behind a

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,810
bar could refuse a woman's service at a

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:40,410
pub if she wasn't with a man or she was

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,410
trying to use her own money interesting

00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,980
the reason I'm telling you this is

00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:50,320
because before this time a woman

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,839
actually didn't have her the rights to

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,210
earn her own money or own property and

00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:58,150
in our day and age they are the things

00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:02,020
that we need to survive cash and a roof

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,400
over our heads without a man she

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,400
couldn't provide these things for

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,930
herself or her kids so it was a woman's

00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,699
lifeline to make sure that she was

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,600
desirable to those in power

00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:15,549
ie men so it was important back then to

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,329
make sure a woman looked good

00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:22,149
she didn't rock the boat she didn't

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:25,629
stand out in fact it was safest for her

00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:28,239
to try and fit in as much as possible so

00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:30,459
it's no wonder that even today when a

00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:33,639
woman walks into a male-dominated

00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:35,859
workplace where she doesn't fit in she

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:40,660
feels an inherent threat to her safety

00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:43,720
and yes I know we have moved on from

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,419
this so we do now have equal rights with

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,699
men but the reason this still affects us

00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:52,419
is because of what I like to call a

00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:54,519
cultural hangover I can explain this by

00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:57,279
telling you how we form beliefs as

00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:58,329
humans so when you're a baby and you

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,279
come into the world

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,579
you've got no beliefs you're a blank

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,109
slate who do you think the first people

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:09,220
you learn how to behave in the world

00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:10,989
from your parents yeah parents who have

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,289
probably lived through these stages and

00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:17,649
they also learn their beliefs from their

00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:20,559
parents so you can see how our behaviors

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:22,959
are always lagging behind what we

00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:26,289
actually should be what we actually

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,239
should believe that makes sense so

00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:30,519
whether you like it or not there are

00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:32,439
probably beliefs that you hold that no

00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,480
longer serve you today but you have them

00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:37,329
because you form them when you were a

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,489
kid we all have those things and unless

00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:42,779
you do a lot of deep work to get rid of

00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:45,609
those it's normal for us to have these

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:48,220
now I know these things are quite hard

00:16:45,609 --> 00:16:52,959
to change but having this awareness is

00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:54,519
the first step it's not all doom and

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,809
gloom though there are things that

00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:02,009
everyone here can do so I'm going to

00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:04,179
first talk to the leaders in the room

00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:08,289
that's my favorite photo of the whole

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:10,839
presentation so leaders what are some

00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:13,659
things that you can do in order to help

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:17,230
this cause although gender inequality is

00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:19,480
such a big issue all we can do is try to

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,389
take try it to take small actions

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,589
towards the bigger goal so leaders the

00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:26,199
number one most

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:30,220
important thing you can do is to walk

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,230
the walk by that I mean take your

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,919
flexible working policies that you have

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,720
at work

00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:37,539
make sure you visibly take parental

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:43,450
leave policies if you need them and have

00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:45,909
them if you you know do leave early to

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,159
go and pick up your kids that's a good

00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:50,860
thing for your team to see because the

00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:53,200
more you do those things the more it

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,270
feels okay for your team to do those

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,510
things it encourages everyone to take

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,730
those policies on the second most

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,730
important thing that you can do is to

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,700
support and invest in the existing women

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:09,279
you already have in your teams all too

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,690
often we go round on a hiring spree and

00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,580
say yeah we're going to hire all these

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,230
women in but we haven't actually looked

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,840
after the women who we already have in

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:19,870
our teams so what can you do to help

00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,299
them ask them what they need try and

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,330
have some deeper conversations with them

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:28,090
on what they need support with and the

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,840
third thing you can do is around

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:34,029
recruitment so I know that we've got

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,010
less women in the pool to choose from

00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,960
but it doesn't mean they're not out

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,820
there it means that you need to put a

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,039
little bit more effort into making sure

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,260
you've tried all different avenues in

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,870
order to see if you can try and get a

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,190
woman on the shortlist for your

00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:54,270
candidate list I learnt something the

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:58,419
other day so have you guys heard of the

00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:01,059
organization women who coach yeah so I

00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:04,570
signed up to their mailing list about a

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:08,350
month ago every Monday I get an email

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:10,059
from women who code with all their job

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,669
listings they've got a job listing board

00:19:10,059 --> 00:19:15,220
on their website I noticed for a few

00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:18,490
weeks that they I'd never seen any jobs

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,289
in the UK in those emails so I went on

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,149
to their jobs board and out of the

00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:24,370
hundreds of listings they've got there

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:28,390
there are only two jobs in the UK there

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:31,210
I then went further on to ask

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,220
I emailed them and said hey how many

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,159
subscribers from the UK do you have on

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:36,970
this list they've got nine thousand two

00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,460
hundred

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,820
subscribers from the UK and only two

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,320
people posting jobs on there I don't get

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,440
any kickbacks from this by the way but I

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,789
would encourage leaders to look into

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,770
that if they want to get their jobs in

00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:52,659
front of more women there is a thing

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,700
involved but you know if that is

00:19:52,659 --> 00:20:00,159
important to you then go and check that

00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:04,299
out men what can you do for your women

00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:07,080
in tech I learnt a new term the other

00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:12,070
day man basilar I really love that one

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:16,020
how can you be a man basilar so or you

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:18,789
can leave the label out if you prefer so

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:21,789
one of the things you can do is to try

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:24,039
and go out of your way to create strong

00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:27,010
working relationships with women in your

00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:30,130
companies it's very easy for us to just

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:31,780
keep to the people we know but yeah try

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,370
and try and try and form these

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,370
relationships with women if you don't

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:39,159
already the more you can open up this

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,770
trustful relationship the more she is

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,990
likely to maybe open up about some of

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,450
the issues she's having so you can go

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,450
and help her

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:52,659
another thing you can do is to try and

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,909
amplify a woman's voice in your company

00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:58,150
because of a woman's position as

00:20:54,909 --> 00:21:01,390
minority in a in a groove it can be very

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:04,330
easy for her voice to get lost two ways

00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,789
you can do this for example in a meeting

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,250
a lot of women I've spoken to and

00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:12,159
coached in the past have said that they

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,230
don't feel like they can speak in

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,630
meetings because their voice is harder

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,970
to hear biologically a woman's voice is

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,690
higher and it's harder for you to hear

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:24,700
it amongst a man's voice and without a

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,710
woman feeling like she's shouting over

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,500
everyone else she'd just rather keep

00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:31,270
quiet so if you see that your female

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,130
colleague has something to say but she

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:37,030
doesn't feel like she can open her mouth

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:39,190
try and direct the team's attention to

00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:40,840
her and say hey I think Lucy's got a

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:45,970
great idea let's see what she's got to

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:48,880
say another thing you can do is try and

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,500
amplify a woman's ideas so if you're

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,210
working with a woman in a team

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,580
she comes up with a great idea and no

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,710
one's heard her just make sure that

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,510
people do hear that this idea came from

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:03,820
Lucy and it's a great one we should all

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:05,890
consider it the final thing is to take

00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,690
advantage of the fact that you've got a

00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,840
woman in your team she's got a unique

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:13,510
perspective much like my friend who

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,080
worked in that design team for a family

00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,360
car he very quickly realized that hey

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,310
this woman has a lot of valuable

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,280
knowledge to share based on her

00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:27,510
different experience and he went on to

00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,310
try and ask her more questions about hey

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,080
what previous cars did you have what

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,410
broken those cars because of your kids

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,090
what happened then what happened next

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,280
take advantage of the fact that you have

00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,900
a different perspective in your team so

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,820
that doesn't just go for women any

00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:49,570
diverse groups women what can you do for

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,960
each other so one thing I encourage all

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:56,530
women in STEM to do is to join a women

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,330
in tech or women in STEM community so

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,420
you can do this via meetups there are a

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:05,590
few meetups here in Bristol already or

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,960
you can do this online so there is there

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,420
are a few slack groups for women in tech

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,820
and there are also some Facebook groups

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,760
I've got my own Facebook group for women

00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,380
in stem where we you know share our

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,940
challenges everyone supports each

00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,040
other's on that so if you're interested

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,100
in joining come and speak to me after

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,560
this talk can I can share with you the

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,020
link

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:32,560
the second thing women in stem should do

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,730
is to try and mentor a more junior woman

00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:38,530
in stem so mentoring can be however you

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,140
want it to take place it can be a formal

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:43,860
setting it can be asking someone out for

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,810
coffee once a month it can just be

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:50,020
asking a more junior woman in your

00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:52,390
office how they're going once a week if

00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,880
you don't know someone more junior in

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,920
your workplace but you have a niece or

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,220
your friend has a you know young

00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,110
daughter just try and be a visible role

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,250
model for them talk to them about what

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,670
you do at work

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,440
and yeah just be there for them and tell

00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,480
them what you do day to day because I

00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,400
think a lot of us didn't grow up with

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:18,190
female role models in STEM women what

00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,990
can you do for yourself the most

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:24,070
important thing you can do for

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:27,370
yourselves is to invest in yourself the

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,500
best way that women can show other women

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,500
that Tech is a great place to work and

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,690
entice them all to this industry is to

00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:40,060
show them you are living hashtag your

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,790
best life so make sure that you are

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,040
looking after yourselves that you are in

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:48,970
a career that you get a lot of

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,920
fulfillment out of lots of joy and that

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,890
you're showing the world that you have a

00:24:50,920 --> 00:25:01,210
great job in tech that other people are

00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:04,990
envious of so before I asked you a

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:08,530
question about on a scale of one to ten

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,590
how much do you want to create change in

00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:14,470
gender balance in your workplaces

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:16,660
if you answered a 6 or above I'd

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,870
encourage you to consider doing one of

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:23,590
the following so leaders in the room if

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:26,230
you answer to six or above and you would

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,610
like to make some positive change

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,820
towards gender balance in your

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,400
workplaces I encourage you to send me an

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:37,270
email or come and speak to me at the end

00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:39,400
of this talk I run consultations with

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,490
businesses who are looking to do this

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,170
and what we do is we look at the

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,000
practices you've already got in place

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,190
and I can provide you with some

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,210
additional steps for things that you can

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:54,250
do to positively create change if you're

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,100
not a leader but you feel like your

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,800
workplace does need some help please

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,600
come and speak to me I'm more than happy

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,840
to help you and there might be a way

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:10,440
that we can work this out

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:13,390
women in tech if you feel like you are

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,429
lacking vision for your future in your

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,170
career you are struggling with

00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:19,630
confidence or time man

00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:23,710
judgment come and speak to me as well

00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:25,630
and you can apply for a spot to do a

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,260
discovery call with me where we'll work

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:32,530
out what the next steps in your life are

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:35,980
to create yet a goal and also a next

00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:39,190
step towards it so that's it for the

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,380
talk I think if I could ask you to take

00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:45,250
just one thing away from my whole talk

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,500
it would be that it is okay to ask

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,630
questions about gender equality it

00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,980
shouldn't be a taboo subject because

00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:55,060
it's something that we all have the

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:57,520
responsibility to make change on so I do

00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:00,190
encourage you to ask any questions

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,270
either now or later on if you're a bit

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,900
shy Thanks

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,900
