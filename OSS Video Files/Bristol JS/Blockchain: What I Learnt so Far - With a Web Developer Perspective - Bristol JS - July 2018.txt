Title: Blockchain: What I Learnt so Far - With a Web Developer Perspective - Bristol JS - July 2018
Publication date: 2018-08-13
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Presented by Noby Fujioka.

My first attempts to build a blockchain dapp (with Solidity and React)

1. My understanding of blockchain technologies so far

2. What I have learnt so far as a newbie on how to build a decentralised application (dapp) and how we can interact with the blockchain from client side (React).

3. Thinking about possible impact on how we are going to build a javascript application in the future (on 3rd generation blockchain technologies...?)

This is my exploratory talk on blockchain and javascript application built on top of it, sharing what I have learnt so far on the topic.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,200
so today I'd like to talk about

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,620
blockchain and what I have learned so

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,069
far

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,929
I'm a very newbie so I just started like

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,099
a month ago or two months of city and

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,670
then I just try to learn as much as

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:21,020
possible for this presentation okay so

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,310
I'm a yes my name is no be Fujioka I'm a

00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:31,619
front-end developer and I love coding

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:35,219
with the react and I'm as well as a

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:39,840
Bristow jeaious I'm organizing a shell

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:43,860
from Jas and I'm also part of react.js

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,300
Academy in London so please check check

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,030
them out okay and so now I discovered

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,329
the blockchain and I'm very excited the

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,410
I don't fully understand but I really am

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,559
really excited so so today I Drive to

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:07,320
talk about four topics so what is

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:10,229
blockchain and its potentials and little

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,689
bit about coding not too much about

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:16,100
Assyrian programming which I would

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,950
discuss and how it interacts with the

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:24,090
front-end JavaScript react for example

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,950
and then maybe what the maybe impact on

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:32,070
how we build our future that that means

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:36,630
decentralized application because that's

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:40,770
that's all about 16 so what is

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,320
blockchain do people know about box yeah

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,720
I guess you know some people are experts

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,060
some people know it'll be about it

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:55,259
Bitcoin cryptocurrencies yes so it's

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,530
kind of buzzwords as well so just

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,360
explain I try to explain blockchain

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:08,899
which is basically digital ledger

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:13,980
okay so so it basically writes

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:18,030
transactions any transactions in a kind

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,030
of block and then then you write one

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,900
block and then you connect another block

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,800
and another block another block so this

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,310
is kind of kind of summarized version

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,750
blockchain so it's a block 1 block 2

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,150
block 3 etc and there you have some

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,849
transaction going on and then ok so

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,970
maybe it's it's do you want to know a

00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:50,340
little bit do you don't see how it works

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:55,370
ok lots of slice so maybe try to maybe

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:59,819
you can help me out so this this guy

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,730
missed and us build this website which

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,959
explained the block check so book saying

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:11,790
use this hash function okay so when you

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:16,110
type something here some data hello

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:19,879
house changes so it produces a hash some

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,629
some specific cou digits

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:26,790
some some numbers I think it's a

00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:27,659
hexadecimal number equals me if I'm

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,180
wrong

00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:36,180
so it just typed and it changes every

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,450
time it changes and there ha always been

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:42,480
typed same what it it's the same same

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:47,099
hash so it's not it's not random it's

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,640
somehow the computer generates the same

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,590
hash so if you go back there hello give

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,370
us the same same hash okay so that

00:03:52,590 --> 00:04:02,909
that's kind of the hash function and in

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:06,030
the block block is okay it's it's it's a

00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:09,769
data again it's producing the hash and

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:14,989
if you look maybe I can make it bigger

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:18,030
so if you look at this number here hash

00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,780
start with zero like there's maybe four

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:25,050
there all depends it's broken defines

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,960
how many how many zeros you you have to

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,860
have

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,919
so this means a signed signed block

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:37,180
because the start was zero so so if I

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:42,009
type something here again like hello

00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:46,720
world it changes and there's no more

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:51,880
zeros now so this is no signed so we

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:55,360
want to to make it kind of official you

00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:00,310
have to make it make some zeros at the

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,199
beginning so how would we do that how do

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:06,509
you think huh

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:10,810
so basically there's no way to kind of

00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:12,400
to walk it out how we can do it so

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,400
basically what you have to start with

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,860
drug zero and one two three and then you

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,380
have to keep trying

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,570
the different numbers so because it's a

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,090
combination of this number block one and

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,060
the combination this number and this

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,460
letter creates this one so only thing

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,860
this is fixed right and this is fixed

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:41,020
the only thing you can change is here to

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:43,659
make a zeros okay so so you can't really

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,400
do that so basically we ask computer to

00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:49,449
do it so we it's called mining so

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,190
computer will try many different

00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:58,539
combinations and then voila so that if

00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:01,900
it finds the the combination so that

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:07,690
number is eight five eight six nine okay

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:09,970
so that's is signed block okay and Anna

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:13,240
blockchain just basically a chain of

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:16,270
that kind of block so interesting thing

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,820
about this is the so the first one is

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,139
obviously each there is no previous one

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:31,229
see you okay you if you let's change

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:35,400
that something yeah if you like you and

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:40,620
you you have to mine it

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,900
okay so you can mine and you put

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,729
something else so that this is it so you

00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,740
sign that and then you create another

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:55,050
one

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:56,760
hello again and I you mind again that's

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,160
right that's right yes so please ask me

00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,350
anything I try to expand as much as

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,040
possible because I don't fully

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,860
understand so but yeah so basically it

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:12,690
creates a hash and then this hash will

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,300
be taken to the next block and then yeah

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,720
and then you have to mine it and then

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,930
you you create another house so they

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,789
another house another hush so I won't

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:31,889
put two words now but let me just

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:35,449
refresh this one and so let's say that

00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:40,080
someone was but now it's it's all signed

00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:43,500
so if you yeah so if you change

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:48,150
something it to everything with black so

00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:52,260
so if you type something as I said so if

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:56,550
you go back to the chain and say hi it's

00:07:52,260 --> 00:08:00,539
oh the zeros disappeared so it just

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:03,990
breaks so then so you know that you kind

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:07,849
of tamp out which the with the data so

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:13,050
you have to if you ask somebody to do

00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:18,870
kind of fraud and then you just have to

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:24,000
mine again from beginning okay so

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:26,849
distributed proxy so there are now the

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,050
not only that that has to be kind of

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:36,240
proved for the mining but also you in a

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:39,860
normal block chain like Bitcoin you have

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,190
different people having the same copy

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:47,390
over the blockchain so you have the same

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,470
copy of the person a person B person C

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,930
so if you

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:55,320
change something one person changed

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,450
something the bloke will be broke same

00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,550
will be different and then when you look

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:05,000
at the hush of the last hush if you be

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:10,490
connected to many many many clocks and

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,440
then if you do cut the last hush and

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,810
compared with other people so most

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,720
people have the same house same house

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,380
but then if you have different different

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,890
hush

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:26,520
then they we know that it's not is

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:30,150
somebody that change the information so

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:40,290
so yeah that's that's a boxer in in

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:43,050
principle okay so going back yeah so so

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,330
now yeah so basically in summary the

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,960
blockchain is like something like a

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:51,660
Bitcoin is basically decentralized and

00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,710
distributed so this is kind of our

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:59,520
traditional centralized like a company

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:03,750
holds some information and you know you

00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:07,280
distribute information or the banks but

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,470
blockchain is kind of peer-to-peer and

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:15,090
so if there's no single point of failure

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:20,460
so if this these digital computers knows

00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:23,550
the of the chain of the kind of network

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:28,400
and if you if this this computer fails

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:28,400
still everybody has the same copy yes

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:47,220
that's right yeah that's right very good

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,850
thank you please help me out here so

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:54,620
yeah so is the network of computers and

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:58,110
decentralized distributed and immutable

00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,960
because if you if you change something

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,900
it's just you can tell that you change

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,500
something

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:10,120
it's immutable and secure and no double

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,570
spending problem that means you can't

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,630
just you have like single source of

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:20,529
truth so you can't have a copy of

00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:22,960
something you can't just copy something

00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:26,080
or change something and that's a

00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,800
database it's a it's a ledger it's a

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,010
ledger that you have one single truth

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,240
okay

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,240
any questions so far

00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,870
yes yes okay so that depends on the

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,580
blockchain

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:46,029
there are many different types of

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,750
blockchain platform so that's a good

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,810
question

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:53,400
so it's good proof of work and there are

00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:56,500
people who are mining who are just like

00:11:53,400 --> 00:12:00,850
concentrating on trying to solve the

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,970
this cryptographic puzzle so you know

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,640
how to get to the zero zero zero zero

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:09,550
and then you make a block so this is

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:12,910
called - and they have like huge

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,670
computing powers and they they they

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:20,730
solve the block and then and then once

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:24,400
we get the approval for everyone then

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:27,160
miner get kind of rewarded so they get

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,770
like how many bitcoins or something like

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,339
that so it's a thing out of thing here

00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:40,380
they they get rewarded of Bitcoin or

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:44,200
other currencies cryptocurrencies yes

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:47,380
yes yes that's right

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,120
so that is yeah that's right so so they

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,670
other people don't don't get and people

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,580
lots of lots of computing powers but

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,940
this this is called proof of work but

00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,990
there's other other methods too to not

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:05,260
to do there lots of computing powers

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:08,770
proof of a stake but yeah maybe if you

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:14,250
have time yes we discuss so the

00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:17,250
blockchain is first generation of the

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:22,110
not the Bitcoin sorry bitcoin is the

00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:25,340
first generation of the blockchain which

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:29,190
became huge then then we will talk about

00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:33,600
aetherium which is the current second

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,460
generation of blockchain which is very

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,260
interesting which makes the blockchain

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:42,960
very very interesting so as I said it's

00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,230
a first generation Bitcoin and so what's

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:50,370
the difference so the Bitcoin is kind of

00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:52,470
almost purely financial transactions you

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,630
can do like send a Bitcoin to one

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,490
person's address another person's

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:03,980
address but that's about it

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:07,080
second generation etherion is what's

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,500
very what's interesting is that on top

00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:15,530
of the financial transaction you can add

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:18,810
smart contract okay smart contracts is

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:22,890
basically digital contract it's a

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,690
computer program and it's like takes all

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,630
the goodness of the blockchain so

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,450
immutable decentralized distributed so

00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:34,580
you can put some program any program on

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:41,550
top of it and you can run it in a global

00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:44,910
blockchain so and it can execute itself

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:49,250
upon conditions or you can you can make

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:56,460
a conditions so it doesn't have to be

00:14:49,250 --> 00:15:00,590
controlled by central authority okay so

00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,760
the potentials of blocks change maybe

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:04,800
well some people actually some

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,820
organizations already started to

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,940
experiment so I up or like

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:15,590
financial transactions already some

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,960
crowdfunding so date a lot - blockchain

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:23,400
platforms already raised some billions

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,850
of billions of dollars so and so a lot

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,750
of people speculative trading so there

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,330
you

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:33,660
equipped currencies and yes some kind of

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:35,520
trading opportunities but it goes up in

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,090
now so a lot of people lose money as

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:43,680
well also we could like before they said

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:49,340
I could charities so like for example

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:52,350
World Food Program is experimenting some

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:57,750
appropriate technologies to for example

00:15:52,350 --> 00:16:00,720
send money to to individual project in

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,240
developing countries etc so this

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,250
basically cuts middleman and you don't

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:10,920
have to pay lots of lots of transaction

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:12,980
fees for bad to banks etc and it's very

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,330
transparent because there's lots of

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,450
transparency issues nowadays if it's a

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:21,120
charities so you you donate money and

00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,950
then you don't know where the money gone

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,620
so yeah and then you can have a smart

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:28,080
illegal contrast like a real estate will

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,390
or some legal contacts you put on the

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,250
blockchain that you can't tamper you

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:38,130
can't change it so it's Korea and it no

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:40,650
government or somebody changing the

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,790
record or something like that you can

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:49,380
use for voting or public records maybe

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:52,500
some identity on it or you know the all

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:57,960
kinds of patents and you can prove our

00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:03,770
use in the future like some global back

00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,770
in computer so that's really exciting

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,520
there's some cops some disadvantages

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,740
well at the moment there's some issues

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,439
like every time you make a transaction

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,189
you make change something in the box

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,310
yeah it costs a little bit of money so

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:22,500
so for example if you built like a

00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,810
Twitter or something on the blockchain

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,540
at the moment in the Bitcoin

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,730
Nobuko in the etherium every time you

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:33,890
send a message it costs you some money

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:37,290
so it's it's a bit of problem with that

00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,270
yeah and then you could probably use for

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,700
supply chain some tracking some

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,790
informations

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:47,490
some to full transparency some people

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,160
say argue that maybe Airbnb oh well

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:55,860
Amazon or any big company could be

00:17:50,160 --> 00:18:00,630
replaced by smart contracts on the

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:03,510
blockchain okay so this is just I could

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,580
took from some website lots of lots of

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,650
actually projects we are nowhere but

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:16,920
lots of projects going no I'm not hiring

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:21,720
like mask or IBM yes a lots companies

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:26,090
even even maybe Google okay so a Syrian

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:31,700
programming so so okay so DT with react

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:34,680
the solidity is a programming language

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:38,510
specially designed for writing smart

00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:42,630
contract on ethereum blockchain network

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:46,680
and syntax is somehow similar to

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:53,460
JavaScript but strictly typed and that's

00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:57,150
the extension for extension so yes okay

00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,930
so try solidity on remix so there's this

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:06,140
website called the remix it's a web IDE

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:14,790
and you can try writing smart contract

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:23,820
yeah okay so it's very simple you can

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:30,350
create a file it's just very simple can

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:30,350
you say maybe not okay

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:42,410
okay so it looks like some kind of

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:45,350
object oriented programming so it's it's

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:50,530
very simple so you create a contract

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:53,570
like a class and then you can declare

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:57,410
some string the variable called message

00:19:53,570 --> 00:20:00,500
and you can have it's a string and it's

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:05,059
a public okay and then the constructor

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:09,520
bit like RIA and then you can I want to

00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:13,929
get some maybe some initial message and

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,919
then you attach the initial message to

00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:22,100
assign to message in contract and then

00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:27,110
you can call it and also you can you can

00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:31,490
set the message after us yeah that's

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:34,429
kind of simple simple contract so yes

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,890
what's quite interesting is this is you

00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:39,640
can you can run a contract you can write

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,440
a contract here and then you can write

00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,700
you can you can choose the environment

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,450
there's a different network

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:51,770
you know JavaScript on your computer

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:55,460
virtual machine or the some some things

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:59,659
on a on a test network and they you have

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:05,140
your account and then you can deploy so

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:11,710
you if you deploy just say hello okay

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:11,710
yeah any show oops sorry

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,780
okay so then initial initial message I

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:29,809
want to deploy the contract so I'm going

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:31,990
to deploy okay oops okay so I you also

00:21:29,809 --> 00:21:37,610
need something called the meta mask

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:40,100
which is kind of where you want to make

00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,429
a payment or transactions you have you

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,799
can this install this Chrome extension

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:50,490
it works on in Chrome at the moment and

00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:53,880
then I want to issue this contra

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:58,340
so you have to pay certain amount of

00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:02,490
money he's just thirteen years thirteen

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:06,330
cents okay and then just submit they say

00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:09,840
this is a test this is a test one so I'm

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:12,210
not having this money but it's a test

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,140
money I have twelve ether for example

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:18,600
and then just submit when you submit it

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,970
takes time because the transaction speed

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,650
is it's very slow broke down at the

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:28,490
moment it will come up here actually I'm

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:37,549
gonna do it on the virtual machine here

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:51,539
and then just say okay and then deploy

00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:53,640
and sorry deploy oh yeah go yeah here

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:55,260
you can see I didn't put any message you

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,280
at the beginning okay doesn't matter

00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,659
here's the deployed contracts it's on

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,870
the memory at the moment but you can

00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:07,200
deploy it on a test network or actual

00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:14,240
network if you want it's very easy and

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:19,400
then you can set the message again you

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:24,030
actually need to put some code yeah yeah

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:26,130
and then set message and then doing some

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:28,679
okay it's approved but normally it

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,370
should be on blockchain network we would

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:35,370
take a few minutes sometimes and then I

00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:39,929
want to retrieve the message and then

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:41,669
you get you so so that that's is just

00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:47,400
kind of quick you can you can try this

00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:50,039
it's very fun and yeah as I said it's a

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,940
UK into a metal mask to to process the

00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:56,640
payment and actually you can send some

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,290
cryptocurrencies from one person to

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,640
another but you have to have a dress

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,610
like or some kind of numbers okay all

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,210
right so

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:11,490
that's that and okay so so so basically

00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:16,740
well you can you can write smart

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:19,289
contract and then on JavaScript

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:23,549
put your JavaScript project you can

00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:26,789
import so see solidity compiler library

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:30,330
and then just run it and when you

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:33,179
compile it it creates a JSON object of

00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:36,210
your contract which is basically

00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:40,140
consists of byte code and ABI

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:45,960
so byte code is like a computer some

00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:50,330
numbers or alphabets that they you put

00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:53,159
on blockchain and then you have

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,919
application binary interface so this

00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,480
this bit you need you need to have it so

00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,720
that you can communicate with the

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:06,480
JavaScript to blockchain to do something

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:10,880
to communicate with a contract okay so

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,409
to deploy so in JavaScript you need to

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,159
basically you have a provider network

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:20,659
provider could be you know the etherium

00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,919
has many different absolutely maynot and

00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:25,200
also test networks

00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:29,010
okay these are different blockchain

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,159
network and you basically tell the

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,140
provider with the information and

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,220
there's another rubber code web 3 which

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:43,559
is a portal to a blockchain and you

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:46,049
create an instance of web 3 and then and

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,809
also create a new contract instance and

00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:52,110
you provide interface and that you

00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:57,480
deploy with the bytecode so that the

00:25:52,110 --> 00:26:00,600
blockchain will take your contract and

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,080
then give you back the deployed address

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,640
so where's the address yeah ok this is

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,909
kind of important so maybe I just

00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,440
explain quickly so you basically when

00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:13,470
you want to interact with for example

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,420
react so you

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,750
let her go into the details yeah

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:23,500
basically you go through the web three

00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:26,590
library and then you you create an

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,710
instance of the contract and you provide

00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:32,320
actual deployed address so you create

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,110
the kind of copy of the of your contract

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,810
on the blockchain but on Anya on your

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:40,330
application so then you just import it

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,220
import you also want to have some

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,330
functionality of web 3 so you've bought

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:49,450
web 3 and you import my contract from

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:52,270
wherever you you put the the instance in

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:57,730
the same project and then you can create

00:26:52,270 --> 00:27:01,390
and you have to add to interact so here

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:03,610
Anthony if you can see but basically say

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:08,440
for example app and then in a component

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:11,070
did mount you can figure in earlier

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,490
examples the contract you have this

00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:17,410
inbox dot methods dot message that will

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,840
communicate to the blockchain I want to

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,930
get the message it's already recorded

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,630
dokgo and then just you can save it on

00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:28,060
the state you guys have a very familiar

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,650
with react or yeah I mean you don't have

00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,670
to use react talk so you can just use

00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:36,310
normal HTML on JavaScript

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:39,970
so yeah you save it and then you can

00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:41,740
show it you can inter interrupt so

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:46,150
that's kind of basic

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:48,340
I made some application but maybe not so

00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,530
interesting so maybe I won't show it

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,960
because it's it's it could be no if

00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:56,380
unless you you you know they don't you

00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:01,600
want to see so now in the future so

00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:04,350
what's going to happen as he said the

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,160
the current transaction speed etcetera

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,870
so Bitcoin only process seven

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:16,060
transactions per second it's very slow

00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:19,990
because you have to check every note and

00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:23,440
a cerium can process twenty transaction

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,460
per second but it's anivia is like

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,700
twenty four thousand

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:31,030
transactions but now it's improving the

00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:34,220
a lot of blocks change platforms coming

00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:38,090
new third-generation block change coming

00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:42,830
so for example ears that just launched

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:44,890
main net can maybe now to three thousand

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,090
maybe in the future it's more

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,720
transactions per second so you can do

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:53,720
very quick transactions so as you can

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,290
see this different so the third

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,630
generation so the etherium was the other

00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:03,500
smart contract but there's a limitation

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:09,410
of scalability because it's so slow to

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:11,510
do to verify all the block so the third

00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:14,930
generation is trying to solve some of

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:19,220
them are kind of soft scalability issues

00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:23,030
so much much faster transactions and so

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:25,520
then and there's another the blockchain

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:28,460
was using called something called proof

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:33,820
of walk as you saw there's minor so then

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:39,020
lots of big - using lots of electricity

00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:42,190
so yeah so the new block change platform

00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:48,050
say they use different different proof

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:50,690
so proof of stake for example okay a

00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:53,260
tragic proof yeah okay you even if you

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,260
know it tell me

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,120
so you don't have to yet - don't have to

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,610
compete like like like blocks change so

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,820
then sometimes it's random randomly pick

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:24,030
the the valid data called valid data and

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:30,570
then the validator do the proof of proof

00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:33,690
you know the easier calculation but if

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,520
you have more stake in that they're

00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:40,500
equipped currency or something you have

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,740
more chance of being chosen as as a

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,840
validator to the mathematical

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,190
computation it's much much more

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,420
efficient and there's some summer

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:56,390
blockchain doesn't have any transaction

00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:59,160
fees like eels so you can make any

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:02,450
transactions at the contract it doesn't

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,820
cost you but maybe you have to put some

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,640
years token at the beginning but yeah

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:12,090
it's just basically it's free but that's

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,309
really I think it's very exciting so now

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,000
the future may be this is the current

00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:20,520
year's presentation so maybe like very

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,309
interesting I could maybe blockchain

00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,559
combined with ipfs have you heard of

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:29,340
ipfs I don't know so much about it

00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,650
it's it's called inter planetary filing

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,470
system it sounds like a Star Trek or

00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:36,420
something but it's basically a

00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,760
peer-to-peer filing system so that you

00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:43,920
can make a filing structure and its

00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,650
global so you can access the file in a

00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,110
kind of blockchain type of things so you

00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:51,450
it's not you can't like you know if you

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:53,910
the Facebook is holding your information

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,450
is if something goes wrong it disappears

00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:59,990
or something like that but it's like

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:03,090
ipfs maybe it's all kind of spread it

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:06,290
distributed so if you some some network

00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,610
node breaks we're still there so you can

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,850
but yeah so this is kind of interesting

00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,370
for example

00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:16,680
this guy was talking about maybe have

00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:20,500
this kind of graph QL back-end and

00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:24,250
blockchain and this interplanetary

00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,800
fighting system and as a new client

00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:32,080
maybe react you know they can

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:35,050
communicate through Apollo as I don't

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,260
know what's the actual ramification for

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:40,800
that but with that but it sounds very

00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,800
interesting

00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,370
yeah so that's like some some hearts

00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,620
that I'm coming across a web 3.0 or

00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:53,790
something like that

00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:58,620
dow is another word it's called

00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:01,450
decentralized autonomous organization

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,090
yeah so basically it's a smart contract

00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,850
very like advanced smart contract we can

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,880
do many things by itself it's like a

00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:13,570
computer program in the in a global

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,450
scale so you don't need a middleman

00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:19,240
it's kind of gives a lot of questions

00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:23,010
what are we gonna do jobs or something

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,290
like that but yeah but very interesting

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,860
so what we know for sure what do we know

00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:37,650
for sure what do you think for the

00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:40,030
future yes I think more JavaScript

00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,750
application will be built on top of

00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:47,520
blockchains

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:52,480
so we reify happy yeah that that's

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:54,970
interesting yeah you're talking about a

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,260
broker a Bitcoin forget about the

00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:02,980
consumption of energy Bitcoin is

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:07,690
consuming like 70 terawatt per year for

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:10,840
electricity and it's like modern Czech

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:15,130
Republic was excellent so it's very bad

00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:19,960
for environmental impact but this this

00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:21,179
is gone I think it's going to change any

00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:38,000
questions

00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:38,000
yes yes sorry how do we stop yes yes

00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:46,819
that's a problem because Bitcoin weights

00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:50,010
become so huge I wrote a book chain

00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:54,359
platform it's so huge you can't change

00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:56,789
the algorithm or the underlying

00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,770
structure so if you change the brakes

00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:02,940
and everybody impacted because they have

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,829
money is in etc so that's why there's

00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:09,660
lots of different generations of block

00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:16,020
change starting up so the first yes but

00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:18,000
then that's kind of risky yeah to have

00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,710
not a quick transaction but it's very

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,020
difficult because they are so huge and

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:27,590
yeah thank you

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,590
