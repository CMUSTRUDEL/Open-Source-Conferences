B I'm Stewart and I'm gonna be noona top

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,960
web accessibility' 101 so we're going to

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,019
have a look at just quickly run over the

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,290
basic components of a website well bat

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,250
what web accessibility actually means

00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,859
how to know if your website is

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,779
accessible a little bit on disability on

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,970
the web and then finally how an

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,279
accessible website benefits you as a

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,930
developer and as a business it's just a

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,900
little about me so I'm a self-taught

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,760
developer nice about six years different

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,529
bunch of different kind of roles a

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,140
currently workers studies the print and

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,050
engineer we help students to study

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,480
abroad and I class myself as an

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,120
accessibility advocate so I'm we really

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,469
stood in code in I'm developing the

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,000
better development and accessibility

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,829
also right through to business that

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,500
study I'm trying to promote is to be

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,350
more accessible and I kind of got into

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,960
this so I'm dyslexia myself so I grew up

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,850
like right there

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,590
and yes I used to talk a bit backwards

00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,879
I'm not very good at writing so if it

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,969
wasn't the computers I think I'd be

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,439
pretty screwed and then when I was at

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,240
uni I started working for action on

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,619
hearing loss as a care worker so I

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,299
worked in a care home with deaf adults

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,500
with learning difficulties and through

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,990
that I got a bit interests in the deaf

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,030
community and then I chose to write my

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,009
dissertation about how deaf people in

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,509
Britain experience music over the course

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:19,799
of traveling around the country I got to

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,600
meet a whole bunch of different deaf

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,729
people some were involved in a deaf

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,970
community some that just had hearing

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,470
impairments and it really was a I can

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,540
experience where I got to see how some

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,340
people had real barriers and things I

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,369
just took the gun heads such as keeping

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,020
in touch with my friends on the phone or

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,000
just ordering a drink in a loud bar but

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,070
also how technology was helping to break

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,970
down those barriers

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,030
yes about that's kind of why I'm

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,340
interested in it so what we reckon a

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,110
website is in its most basic form and

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:57,479
then we've got any ideas texts I like it

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,369
any of us either work real good I mean

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,290
it's definitely not this it is just a

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,880
text document so here we've got a screen

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,560
shot one of the earliest websites we've

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,060
got heading at the top a couple of

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,209
paragraphs a list and a whole load of

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,180
links so I just quickly scan over this

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,800
section and so for me this free basic

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,770
element to make up a website with

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,990
HTML CSS and JavaScript and if we think

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,640
of ease as Batman HTML would be a

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,620
skeleton so it's a structure in the

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,360
content we've got specific elements and

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,980
specific jobs a paragraph element for

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,870
paragraph different head amounts of

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,700
different types of head him I'm the

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,350
owner of this is really important so if

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,270
you had a book and on the front cover

00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,860
was the title for the first chapter

00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,330
where the title for the first chapter

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,280
was the title of the book it wouldn't

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,680
make any sense exactly the same page do

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,570
you know when it comes to the CSS this

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,610
is the presentation layer what's making

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,520
this bit of text this color of black and

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,890
that font size and if you'd in your HTML

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,960
right if for some reason your CSS breaks

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,170
then your website should still be usable

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,910
and finally we got job script carrying

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,980
out of the actions making your site

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,170
interactive and this is often where

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,430
accessibility can fall down just because

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,320
you can make something interactive

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,180
doesn't mean you should but also

00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,810
javascript is essential for making a

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,750
website completely accessible and

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,270
without CSS and JavaScript work in a

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:16,680
website you should function so while it

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,450
wouldn't be the same experience still

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,310
need to users still need to be able to

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,540
carry out the core from jelly so here

00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,700
we've got a screenshot of a study home

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,400
page with CSS and JavaScript working and

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,959
here's with JavaScript off so if heaven

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,700
forbid I write something terrible and

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,410
everything breaks someone's got really

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,000
aggressive ad blocker they can still

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,640
access our menu here it doesn't look

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,700
pretty but it's functional and again say

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,650
no CSS no JavaScript but we've still got

00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,010
hopeful it looks like a menu in some

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,870
really basic links so just on the basics

00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,180
final thing this numeron and a11 wine so

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,420
we are beginning eleven letters in the

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,100
why sometimes referred to as a li BR

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,209
only being but if it's not explained i

00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,610
don't think you'd be able to work out

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,290
what it is but on the flip side I can't

00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,239
spell accessibility but I can remember a

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:08,730
one why sweet any questions on those

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,709
cool all right moving on so what does

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,360
web accessibility actually mean there's

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,190
a whole load of really complicated

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,320
dictionary definitions but for me it's

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,690
just making sure that anybody can access

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,910
your website a relevant of what device

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,700
they're using how fast their connection

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,260
is what language they speak a permanent

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,900
temporary or socio-economic disability

00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,480
as Tim berners-lee said the power of a

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,040
web is in its universality access by

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,700
everyone regardless of their disability

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,650
is an essential aspect of it so how do

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,780
you know if your websites accessible

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:44,350
well with some guidelines so the World

00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,300
Wide Web Consortium w3c created v's the

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,170
web content accessibility guidelines

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,940
sometimes refers to as a work hack and

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,720
they're broken down into four principles

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,310
so visa can be overarching categories

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,420
inside those thirteen guidelines so

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,120
these are basic goals that we're trying

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:04,600
to achieve things like text alternatives

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,920
time-based media and navigatable inside

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,390
each of the guidelines there's a bunch

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,120
of success criterion so these are

00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,940
specific testable objectives such as use

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,730
of color and audio controls and each

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,200
criterion has a level of compliance the

00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,790
level compliance depends on how

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,570
difficult is to implement and how

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,590
essential it is to access for content so

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,590
I'll have a look at each of these in a

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,260
sec so start with your principles we've

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,600
got perceivable operable understandable

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,010
and robust so when it comes to

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,350
perceivable it's defined as the

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,120
information user interface components

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,760
must be presentable to users in ways

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,320
which they can perceive so we'll have a

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,670
look at the study site and the mobile

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,490
menu specifically for each of the

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,470
different categories so for me as a

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,720
sighted user if I look to the site on a

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,040
small device like my phone I can see

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,080
that this little icon on the right the

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,550
burger icon I presume is going to open a

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,530
menu but because I can see I can

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,030
perceive that that's fair but what

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,630
happens if the website was pronounced to

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,040
you or if you had sorry if a website was

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,590
made out to you how would you perceive

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,990
at venues there depending how you'd code

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,360
it so for us the button with only beaver

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,830
have Java scripts working if someone was

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,690
having a site read out to them when they

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,400
came to focus on their it would read out

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,590
the name of the element so button and

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,150
then it would read out menu here so I

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,350
designed it didn't want the bit of text

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,390
because he felt it cluttered at the

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,860
interface but for someone having a site

00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:25,630
read out to them hopefully about sort of

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,630
contact for them to perceive what that

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,460
little elements going to do when it

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,710
comes to operable user interface

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,320
components and navigation must be

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,540
operable so this is kind of about how

00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,590
you interact with the site so for me if

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,690
I'm using the site on my phone probably

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,770
is my thumb to open a mobar menu but

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,720
that's because I got full use of my

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,870
hands but what about if I was using the

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,900
mobile site with a keyboard because

00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,820
we've used a button we can tab along to

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,980
it and use the space or the Enter key

00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,020
and that would open up the menu but if

00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,580
we hadn't used the right bit HTML this

00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,700
might not be operable so when a user

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,740
couldn't open up the menu so

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,180
understandable is defined as information

00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,330
and the operation of user interfaces

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,890
must be understandable so when I see the

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,680
burger icon you're going to presume it's

00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:14,840
going to open up the menu but if it

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,280
opened up say I don't a signup form for

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,980
the newsletter that will be really

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,050
confusing I'm not a massive fan of my

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,050
example but I thought a better one was

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,930
v's norman doors so hands up on the

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,880
right who thinks this is a

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,900
pull-pull-pull handle all right what

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,070
about push it's a push they did it the

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,480
wrong way around if you ever come up to

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,070
one of these doors and you go to push it

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,170
or pull air and it's wrong it's really

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,650
confusing this is more I feel what

00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:44,990
understandable is trying to get out and

00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,730
finally we've robust so content must be

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,860
robust enough can it be interpreted

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,520
reliably by a wide variety of user

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,780
agents including assistive technologies

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,270
for me this really also is about

00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,890
performance so let's say that we've done

00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,320
a terrible job of coding the site is

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:01,970
super slow someone's on a really old

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,650
Android phone on a really poor data

00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,660
connection there might be a chance that

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,060
they can't open the menu or if I do it

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,280
lags so they'll touch it nothing happens

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,570
I'll touch again it'll close so you've

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,790
got to make sure that your sites are

00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,320
robust enough to withstand not just me

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,950
using on a fancy MacBook Pro on a

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,930
gigabit day alone by focusing on the

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,310
principles and not the technologies we

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,840
emphasize the need to think about the

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,210
different ways that people interact with

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,100
the content the guidelines are great but

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,870
then not there as a box-ticking exercise

00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,250
if you have air just doing some

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,800
programming tests and it said it was

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,150
accessible that's doesn't necessarily

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,410
mean your site is actually accessible

00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,180
it's really important to make sure you

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,450
test with a wide variety of different

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,790
users so one of the things we came up

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:45,710
against study so before I joined we'd

00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,360
gone with this super bright orange which

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,880
presents a bunch of problems if you kind

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,400
of put text over the top so if you had a

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,130
color contrast text this white I think

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,830
18 pixels comes out as Skouras 3.01

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,720
which fails accessibility for the basic

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,270
level we're trying to achieve whereas

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,400
the black comes out at just over 5 but

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,810
when we test it we users and doing some

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,330
research about this kind of shade of

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,400
orange most people would say that the

00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,770
the white text is actually easier to see

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,630
so while it failed the programming tests

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,490
when we tested whether users and did

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,530
some research we felt that this was the

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,600
better option so that's where I feel you

00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:25,740
just could use common sense and not just

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,600
stick to the guidelines so we looked at

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,970
the principles there we'll have a look

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,980
at the compliance I mentioned earlier so

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,280
there the higher the level the more

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,800
restraints it will put on your design

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,390
single a they say will have some impact

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,420
double a will have medium impact and

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,400
triple a high to extreme now when it's

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,440
in high to extreme it's more referring

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,610
to the difficulty to implement rather

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,550
than the fact you're going to have just

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,870
a black and white website you really

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,870
want to be aiming for double a

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,660
complaints I do know how the legislation

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,060
affects us but in the end of last year

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,710
in the EU if you were working with a

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,540
public body you have to have at least

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,970
double a compliance a similar

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,460
legislation in the US and to be honest

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,800
just to make sure you dream delivering a

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,250
robust experience Double A is what you

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,020
need to be aiming for so how do you know

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,730
if your website is accessible so I

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,280
thought we'd go through an example going

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,380
a few through a few of the success

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,940
criterion so let's say we want to make a

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,980
video for the Bristol jeaious meetup

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,930
it's a one minute animated video but

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,370
plinky plinky kind of soundtrack but how

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,590
do we make sure that it's accessible to

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,240
a wide variety of users so the first

00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,670
thing we have to do is make sure there's

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,370
an audio description or media

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,750
alternative so this will be really easy

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,430
for us to do let's say we've got a

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,080
scriptwriter in they've written the

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,000
script for one minute we already have

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,560
that in a Google Doc all we now need to

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,840
do is put that somewhere else on the

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,670
page so for instance if someone can't

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,160
the other site because it can't load or

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,050
because of a physical disability they

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,430
can access the content they can still

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,010
know what we're trying to explain to

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:01,560
them in the video so by doing that we've

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,890
got single leg compliance so next we

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,540
have adding some captions so a few years

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,290
ago this might be quite difficult job

00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,880
you know to make

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,800
you've got all the scripts right it

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,630
comes in at the right time in but we're

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,460
putting our video up in YouTube they've

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,020
got some functionality that they'll help

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,640
you always sync it up and you can trim

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,430
it around so really quickly

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,970
we can't rake the script put it on to

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,130
YouTube

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,840
turn it in some captions OOP we're

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,160
double a compliant now while this is

00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,560
great for someone with a hearing

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,730
impairment if you're say trying to view

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,750
the video in the office and you don't

00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,400
want to play it but you want to know

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,290
what's going on and captions might come

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,790
up on Twitter therefore we're helping

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,130
sighted user sorry

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,750
users that have hearing be able to

00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:41,960
access our content if for some reason

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:44,580
they're choosing not to play the audio

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,710
I'll leave audio description but we'll

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,120
look at sign language so there's over

00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,170
300 different sign languages in the

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,370
world so in Britain we have BSL in

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,650
America vulgar ASL and they're

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,450
completely different so we use a 200

00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,130
alphabet so this would be a in British

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:02,790
sign language in American Sign Language

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,320
this would be a so you can see there if

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,910
we were trying to have 300 different

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,370
sign language interpreters on our site

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,990
that would be expensive and we really

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,330
difficult to do how would someone choose

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,640
which of the 300 they want so I would

00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,050
say maybe you could argue there that's

00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,510
something where you wouldn't implement

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,980
your play but where the Bristol

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,840
JavaScript me up therefore would be

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,970
reasonable to say we just need British

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,080
sign language interpreter on there we

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,520
could find us a couple of charities

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,960
locally where someone had come down

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,210
quickly due to video they're

00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,280
interpreting furs and there we've got a

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,950
triple-a video so hopefully that's a

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,690
kind of quick rough example of how these

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,640
would actually apply to a real use case

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,150
so let's have a look at disability on

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:45,960
the web anybody oh I guess a WAP centage

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:50,100
of UK identifies as being disabled 20

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,050
anybody else 28 really close between a

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,510
lot of them 21 and a half of UK

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,190
identifies have been disabled so if your

00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,350
website wasn't that accessible that's

00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,120
like saying that the whole population of

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,570
London and the entire population of

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,860
Scotland cannot access your site in

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,750
reality I imagine it's much higher

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,850
faster Stoneham a sentence about people

00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,010
that identifies being disabled so

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,240
someone say in the back end of yorkshire

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,130
who's got a terrible data connection

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,080
wouldn't classify as disabled but if you

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,780
size know optimize they can access your

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,790
content and this that's pretty similar

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,070
around the world so in the US it's a bit

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,740
over

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:27,250
19 in New Zealand it's just a touch over

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,380
23 so it's a pretty good average and in

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,640
Britain if you're disabled on average

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,950
life's gonna cost you five hundred

00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,180
eighty three pound more every month so I

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,800
think the least we can do is try and

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,710
make our websites accessible to ease

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:41,020
that burden so when we're talking about

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,150
the web WC you've got five main

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,000
categories they are seeing hearing

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,700
speaking moving and thinking and we'll

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,050
have a look at each of those now and

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,400
when it comes to those disabilities

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,690
they're put into four different

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,200
categories so we've got permanent

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,620
temporary situational and socio-economic

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:01,420
so permanent pretty self-explanatory but

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,160
temporary so like a kitty here's got a

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,270
cone on for a couple of weeks therefore

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,860
we're not gonna be able to hear properly

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,690
and what they can hear is going to sound

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,070
a bit weird the same is say you had an

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,780
ear infection for a few weeks

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,540
therefore you can't hear the video

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,190
properly so the subtitles we created

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,610
earlier gonna make our video easier to

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,960
access when it comes to situational if

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,640
you're sitting in a coffee shop and you

00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,530
try to have a video call what happens to

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,910
myself quite a bit it's impossible to

00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,710
hear someone because the machines blast

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,780
in a way your ear but if you can have

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,880
some subtitles come up on your video

00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,040
call you can still participate fully in

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,380
the conversation and when it comes to

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,120
the last one I'd say for me this is

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:42,070
about users are going to be on poor

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,690
device and poor data connections so I'll

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,150
have a look at seeing so the first video

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:49,420
I've got here is of me having a quick

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:51,640
rummage around on the study website I'm

00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,490
using the screen reader voice over by

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,110
Mac and it's been used on Safari so most

00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,970
screen readers the technology of it can

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,760
literally read out a screen they pair

00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,680
better with a particular browser worth

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,570
knowing I'm not screaming at a user so

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,100
how I'm interacting my site is probably

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,840
completely different how in native

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,460
screen readers will be doing I also

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,620
messed up the video so the first bit you

00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,340
can't see the top but you should be able

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:20,020
to hear those on safari students newly

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:23,410
studying visited navigation no link

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:25,540
about show some menu for about shoe some

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,780
menu for about expanded but link after

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,700
link link link link shows up menu for

00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,930
about show submenu for about to collapse

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,240
any level one discover the

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,210
University for you heading level two

00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,310
house 2d can help you heading level

00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,810
three you know heading levels heading

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,760
left heading lab heading level two two

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,589
items we match students with

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:51,470
universities all over the world link

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:52,970
find a program you want cool so bit of a

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,709
rough example but firstly I was just

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,000
gonna burn along a bunch of interactive

00:15:54,709 --> 00:16:00,740
elements and then secondly I was moving

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,510
along by heading so that's the most

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,130
common way on the last year screenreader

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,990
server that screenreader users will use

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:11,600
your site so you'll navigate the page

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:13,339
going down different headings okay so

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,500
next up we've got a Braille reader

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't know whole load about these but

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:54,529
video will do a better job that's just a

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,450
quick video about one way somebody with

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,910
a visual impairment might be accessing

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:01,310
your site onto hearing so this is a

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,610
video of Google me which is Google's

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,199
video calling app on their they now have

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,699
some live captions I kind of touched on

00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,550
it earlier so as you're speaking about

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,709
create captions for you this video is a

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,390
deaf a guy from Australia called Michael

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,030
Lowry who's very much into captions and

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:36,840
transcripts and it's him just testing

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:38,340
out the feature so you can

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,809
did a pretty good job of picking up

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:45,480
whatever same so when it comes to

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,070
speaking I feel an example I could come

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,529
up with was on the study site we have a

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,720
chat bot so often we're speaking to

00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:54,059
students maybe from Pakistan or Nigeria

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,330
where English is a second language and

00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:59,100
very much to a varying degree of ability

00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,110
so the way the business used to work is

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,059
you would somehow get in touch of us and

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,380
then we have a call center in Ecuador

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,809
and they would give the potential

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,400
students a ring a whole bunch of

00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,110
problems with this time zones been one

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,480
of them but the English been another one

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:14,159
where with a chatbot the students very

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,720
much can get in touch whenever they want

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,169
the advice centre is running 24 hours a

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,000
day now but also by having a chat bot

00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,380
they can do it in their own time they

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,240
don't have to feel pressured the same

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,429
way as they do in a video call but by

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,770
being text they can't rate make use of

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:31,350
translation services they wouldn't be

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,669
able to use if it's a video call I think

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:34,350
it also is great for other people

00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:36,870
personally I probably prefer a chat bot

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,580
to communicate with so you're opening up

00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:42,000
your site if you use something like that

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,409
to a whole bunch of different users next

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,330
remote control so there's a whole

00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:46,679
different array of devices that

00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,260
different people with various

00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,149
disabilities can use there one here I've

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,059
got its mouse tick so this person is

00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:59,360
controlling their tablet using a mouse

00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:01,770
tick so finally we got thinking so

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,809
animations and transitions can be really

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,240
helpful for guidance users around our

00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:08,010
interfaces but for some people that can

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,100
be really hurtful such as people with

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,380
their stimuli disorders sometimes a

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,450
migraine and seizures V's animation can

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,070
trigger a lot of hurt so one simple

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,779
thing we can do is give them the option

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,820
to turn it off so in your browser you

00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:23,010
can set to reduce motion and then with

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,630
this little bit of CSS you could then

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:28,740
disable all your animations and

00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,870
transitions dyslexia is the most common

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,100
learning disability in the UK and one of

00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,750
the easiest ways you can help your

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,700
celexa people it's keeping your line

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,740
length down so you want to have the line

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,870
of text here while being terrible to

00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,750
read because it's over an image it's

00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,669
also super long so if a selected person

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,049
to try follow the text over there the

00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,270
chances are that they could easily be

00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:50,690
like I'm jumping often I jump down a

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:54,330
line before I've got to the end of it

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,010
whereas you see BBC here nice shot line

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,870
limp so it's much easy to digest but

00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,429
it's the same for any user because often

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,080
our displays a flashy nutters it's

00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,770
difficult to concentrate if you have a

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,150
long line limp and but it's more than

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:10,320
just interfaces it's all about

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:12,240
performance SEO and content so finally

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,850
how does an accessible website benefit

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,340
you so there's a lots of different

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,380
benefits to your business first up good

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,200
accessibility is often good SEO as we

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,980
touched on earlier with the transcript

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,049
Google's not going to wait around to

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,400
crawl a video but if you have the chance

00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:27,960
gets a video there they'll know what's

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,370
going on your page the same when it

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,830
comes to alt text and lots of other

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,750
different aspects of accessibility um

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,820
it's good for your corporate social

00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,440
responsibility and your ethics appeal if

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,549
you're a company that's promoting the

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,470
fact you're making your website

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:41,910
accessible that's surely going to have

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,559
benefits for you more potential

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,330
customers means more potential revenue

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,780
if you ignore London in Scotland that's

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:50,370
a lot of potential customers in the UK

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:52,020
minimizing your legal risk so it is a

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,390
legal requirement in the UK for your

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,840
website to be accessible we have a

00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:00,870
Disabilities Discrimination Act of 1950

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,660
as act of 2010 and section 20 of that

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:06,270
states that services provide service

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,710
providers specifically have a duty to

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:10,380
make adjustments for disabled persons

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,809
whether they are an online service or a

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,179
brick and mortars establishment now in

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,820
the UK I am not particularly wary of any

00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:20,010
lawsuits but I do know that RNIB but as

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,780
the ban charity have contacted some

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,970
large companies and said look your

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,710
site's unaccessible here's your problems

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,070
you need to fix it because it's a legal

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,630
requirement but over in the USA the last

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,940
year Domino's you might have come across

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,530
were in trouble so a blind man who was

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,299
using a screen reader trial to his pizza

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,850
couldn't honor his pizza because they

00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:40,260
hadn't developed their website properly

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,000
he took them to court it went all the

00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,650
way to Supreme Court because Domino's

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,330
felt for the Americans with Disabilities

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:47,580
Act didn't cover their website the

00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,370
Supreme Court firmly disagreed most

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,780
Korean had been settled outside court

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,370
this has increased a lot and then is

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,750
drive-by lawsuits in the UK where

00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:56,250
someone comes to the site it's

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,320
inaccessible and they're trying to sue

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,679
them in 2018 increased two hundred

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,410
seventy seven percent in the US I

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:05,180
presume at some point in battle commode

00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,490
as well this is a really great article

00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,720
it's quite old from a list apart as a

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,790
link here and at the end of the slides

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,230
to some resources to it but it does a

00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,660
good job but just going over the main

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:18,470
points and when it comes to law in the

00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,910
UK so here's some simple things you can

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,220
do to ensure that your websites

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,990
accessible when it comes to type make

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,750
sure using a sensible font size don't go

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:28,600
too small or super big and make sure the

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,890
spacing between your lines is logical

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,640
when it comes to colors make sure that

00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:36,650
your text is easy to read content is

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,840
often really overlooked if you've got

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,950
really complex language in there that's

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,930
going to be difficult for someone with

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,430
dyslexia but maybe somewhere English as

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,900
a Second Language or someone that was

00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,340
having the page translating for them

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,230
it's gonna be much harder for that to

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,520
work with links you need to make sure

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,860
that your interactive style is

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,630
consistent once users learn okay

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,090
this thing is a link they can apply that

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,860
learning across your site and also the

00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,600
text you've gotten a link just having

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,310
read more it's not sufficient on its own

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,810
the link text should tell the user

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,360
exactly where they're going to go or

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,400
what they're going to do when it comes

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,540
to images the simplest way probably you

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,190
can make your merged site more

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,230
performance you just make sure that you

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,000
compress your images and serve them up

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,040
at the right size only needs to be

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,970
ruined your pixels wide don't have an

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,920
image of 2000 pixels wide and with forms

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,290
make sure that the labels are always

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,970
visible and are really clear and use a

00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:29,750
correct form element for the correct

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,490
type of question so for me I use this

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,870
little JavaScript bookmarklet to check

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,130
my sites it's super fast you just click

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,360
it from your bookmarks bar and it pops

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,850
up so you've got all the different kind

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,080
of things you can check one of the

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,210
things I really like here for your

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,130
headings you get an outline and then

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,560
next to each head and you get a little

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:50,720
box maybe you can see on the top left of

00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,340
the day of discover and so it tells you

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,140
what the heading type is it gives you a

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,970
green box if using the correct heading

00:23:54,140 --> 00:24:00,920
using incorrect heading it will pop up

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:04,010
red BM this is a really great tool so

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,810
few resources here on these slides the

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,210
one I'd like to point out specifically

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,910
is don't use Google Lighthouse to audit

00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,500
your site somebody here wrote an article

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,330
where they built something it was

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,860
getting a hundred percent accessibility

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,180
score we lighthouse but it completely

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,380
bombed

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,090
it's really not a great tool for

00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,100
accessibility so in summary an

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,440
accessible website isn't just about

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,460
disabled users think about if you fell

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,020
off your bike tomorrow

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,140
you broke your mouse hand how are you

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,910
gonna interact with a website and

00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,500
accessible sites gonna open you up to

00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,500
more users so therefore you can make

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,780
more money good content is really

00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,280
critical obviously I'm sure most of us

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,050
could write some content that doesn't

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,240
necessarily mean we should a copywriter

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,570
will go a long way to make an accessible

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,410
website it is a legal requirement here

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:53,240
in the UK an automatic testing it should

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,160
only ever be a guideline make sure you

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,990
test for users as much as possible even

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,330
if that's just different colleagues your

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,790
mom get out there and test with some

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,680
different users and it's lonely Watson

00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,510
said web accessibility' isn't about

00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,790
being perfect just about being a little

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:21,830
bit better than yesterday cool thanks

00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:23,450
for listening yeah I think the line

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,130
height I mean it would depend on the

00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,170
type of text so if it's a head you know

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:32,030
if it's a paragraph off top my head I

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:33,290
think is 1.5 for line height but I've

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,060
got a couple links I could send you

00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:36,710
rather than me trying to away

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:46,010
for it and sorry what was your question

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:47,120
like hi and yeah once again I have a

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,710
couple of numbers in my head but I'll

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:56,600
check something and come back to after

00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:58,520
about so Kay just so at line yeah yeah

00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,560
I'll share the slides afterwards and

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,100
everything apart from one video should

00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,100
be accessible

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:22,820
yes yes if you have monitoring what okay

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,650
so I guess then you would know but at

00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:28,270
that very moment in time you users still

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,270
would have a problem is that correct

00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,530
sure yeah I guess I would say I mean

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,210
that's it that's a fair argument I mean

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,680
I would off they with without blockers

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,020
so for instantly I was trying to order

00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,700
some medicine for my kitten my ad

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,290
blocker was breaking some JavaScript on

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,750
this site verify I couldn't auto meds

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,430
for my kitten it's very frustrating but

00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,710
just for me as a principal I would say

00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:50,570
JavaScript's a progressive enhancement

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,070
and it's not essential for the website

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,320
so make that's kind of a methodology I

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,330
go down and ideally yeah definitely

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,950
having a support team to help you but

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:03,970
for me core functionality should be

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,970
accessible without JavaScript question

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,540
sure so Aria I would use as a second

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,030
resort there's a really good article I

00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,920
didn't link to buy some Kucera higly

00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,520
where she says like teacher kids about

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,500
Aria but the point is the Aria is great

00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,270
but if you if there's something else you

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,490
can use it's better to the reason being

00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,040
that screen readers are notoriously

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,330
difficult support maybe like what was

00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,460
that five or six years ago to try to do

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,230
cross browser support a good example

00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,970
which says the walls of property

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,500
Ferrario controls so basically this

00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,630
button you give it an idea of something

00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,130
it controls that support has completely

00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,290
been dropped which is irritating because

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,150
it would be really useful so I would try

00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,800
use something else before he's in that

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,530
ideally for me I would have the word

00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,540
menu there so I my grands 92 and we got

00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:01,040
an iPad at Christmas she's no idea what

00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,750
the burger icon does but if she could

00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:07,180
see it she'd be fine

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,180
yeah does out cool

00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:14,760
giving it sorry you've been developing

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:25,820
if you've seen any changing how ready

00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:28,140
people are to invest how many change

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,580
yeah I think it does but I think it

00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,840
depends how you do it so I've had

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,350
problems before our agents is

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,029
specifically where clients don't

00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:37,620
necessarily see the value you can tell

00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,720
them it's a legal problem but because I

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,580
can't say look this company was suit

00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,980
like in here it wasn't Domino's in the

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:46,200
UK dat was suit they're not gonna care I

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,399
guess the best example is when I came in

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,110
to study I was really given the

00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:50,970
opportunity to say look here's our

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,039
accessibilities good I did a bit the

00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,080
presentation of the company and then as

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,090
soon as I got the slide up about the 21%

00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,830
of the UK the CEO was like yeah this is

00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,770
amazing why we never come across this

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,240
before so I think it's really about

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,679
trying to get the ground up and explain

00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,840
to the whole company why it's important

00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,370
but then I do feel a bit like we did the

00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,470
jobs with question earlier if you've got

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,330
your HTML right that is most your access

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,980
ability problems done and if you do your

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,870
jobs get right again like if you're

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,419
making a div interactive it's a wrong

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:29,960
thing to do so I think it all comes down

00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:29,960
to good programming principles yes

00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,179
that's for screenreader so one of the

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,760
ways you can navigate with the screen

00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:40,230
readers going by headings and that when

00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,169
there's a screen reader surveyed in

00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,270
every year by I think it's bad to be

00:29:43,169 --> 00:29:46,740
free see again I'll share a link to it

00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,779
was this really interesting survey and

00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,279
the most common way that screenreader

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:51,929
user would navigate the site is by

00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:53,760
literally ravelin at beginning I went by

00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:56,370
the links they would go down by the head

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,990
in so you go from h1 to all the h2s if

00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,909
you like H to you then go inside it

00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,409
again so that's why I get your headings

00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:02,700
right it's so important and making sure

00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:06,240
the heading actually describes the

00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,390
content that's fair and so yeah cool all

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,309
right

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,000
I'll stop there yeah thanks everybody

00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,309
thank you

00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,309
