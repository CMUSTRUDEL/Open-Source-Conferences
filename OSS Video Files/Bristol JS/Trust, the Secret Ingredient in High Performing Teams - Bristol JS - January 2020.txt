	Trust, the Secret Ingredient in High Performing Teams by Jaycee Cheong

Building a high performing team had always been a hot topic in the software world. Have you ever wondered how you can play a part in it?

Trust is one of the few key ingredients in a high performance team, In fact, the most effective way to build trust with your peers, and managers, comes from you, a member of the team.

This talk will outline the “What, Who, How, and Why”, a practical strategy on cultivating trust in your team. Combining the art and science on building trust, the goal is to inspire everyone to view their team in a new light, and helping each other in achieving more.

hi everyone I think I know quite a few

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,060
people here we've definitely got a lot

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,970
of immersive last people here

00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,400
representing in this corner so a little

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:14,910
bit my by myself

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:19,500
I'm JC I work at immersive last one of

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:24,539
the sponsor for tonight I have done four

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,570
rows for jobs in 24 months the company

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,140
also grew from 10 people to a hundred

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,050
and twenty people in the past 24 months

00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,059
so despite them why I had different

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,760
roles for other company the only

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,070
constants I had was joining and building

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,629
a high-performing team became a my new

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,960
normal so I have done quite a few things

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,969
so I was I joined as a software engineer

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,469
I'd then worked a little bit in the tech

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,930
leading role and then went into

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,850
engineering management and now going

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,890
back being a software engineer so I've

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:04,110
done the loop and I realized that team

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,000
health is actually taste contribution

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,850
from all it takes contribution from

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,070
yourself and your managers and your

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,939
organization and apparently

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,670
high-performing team is something that

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,009
everyone wants since 1994 is a huge

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,470
increase of research on trusts

00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,740
especially in the organization and how

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,060
he affects the team performance and I

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,990
found that there was a lot of resource

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,420
for team leads and managers around

00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,390
college being and Trust in teams not so

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,409
much for individual contributors so this

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,560
talk is gonna be kind of talking about

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,409
interpersonal trust which often cannot

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,119
be influenced or you know not often as

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,180
influenced by external support like your

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,649
team leader and your managers so this

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:57,719
talk is for my fellow you I see I will

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,210
include some tips for leads and managers

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,240
as we go along

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,090
so what is trust before we kind of go

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,119
into the dictionary definition in the

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,670
neuroscience world there are a lot of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,500
Rita says that your oxytocin level in

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,340
your brain when you

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,040
reach a sort of trustworthy relationship

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,050
with someone so in in an early term yeah

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,340
oxytocin goes way up when you are

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,990
interacting with someone that you trust

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,820
that often is spoken about like oxytocin

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,920
for when people are fighting enough but

00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,910
you know that's the basis of a trusting

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,590
relationship so and oxford dictionary

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,450
says that that's something really worthy

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,470
and I was like okay this is I'm not

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,690
gonna use his explanation is and I've

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,790
been following a lot of work from when

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,060
they Brown and she did a lot of work

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,959
around social work and like he's thought

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:59,459
leadership and team health and she had

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,709
this anatomy of trust which again it's

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,110
quite in-depth i won going to go for it

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,239
today but it's worth looking up she's

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,260
got a lot of blog posts of resources

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,820
online that you can go into but i'm just

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,370
going to go on something relatively

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:21,170
simple truss it's a definition is that

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:27,150
the moment i know i can lean on you and

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:30,299
why it matters so head of industry at

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:34,860
google kind of did a day have done the

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:37,799
research on project astrid Harris drove

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,380
about a high-performing team these

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,299
psychological safety it's a little bit

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,070
different than trust but we'll get to

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:52,670
that so I'm going to be quoting this

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:56,700
study a lot by Edmondson back in 2004 a

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,890
team needs high psychological safety in

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,410
order to facilitate collaboration work

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,110
especially when are their faces

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,470
uncertainty a lot of change and need to

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:09,450
learn together hands out does that sound

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,260
like the kind of work that you do on a

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,880
day to day basis yeah I think a lot

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,100
people working like startups and scaled

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,620
up at the moment in Bristol the reason

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,169
why we need to come and cultivate

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,440
psychology safety it promotes a lot of

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:27,340
these behavior that can contribute to a

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,620
high output and quality

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,440
but the pro most innovative behavior and

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,449
infinite information encourage team

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,930
members to engage in boundary spanning

00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,479
that's more around in the technical way

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,470
you normally hear it called

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:47,460
cross-functional and trust and respect

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,080
in the horizontal group your peer

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,120
relationship promotes team psychologist

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,300
safety so this is the bit that I'll be

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,880
going in depth into today so in that

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,169
study what's quite nice about it is that

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,880
it kind of have this perfectly nice

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,370
diagram so I had to draw it out myself

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,490
okay just copy it so I will be

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:09,310
concentrating on the trust and respect

00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,620
mostly on the trust part how it sort of

00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:16,120
contributes to your team learning

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:17,860
behaviors so yeah Trust it's a key

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,150
component of elevating your team

00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:24,460
psychology or safety I'm gonna go into

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,330
how do you build trust with your peer

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:32,680
and your managers it's a billion times

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,229
with peers this quote from Hemingway is

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,470
quite nice the best way to find out if

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:41,979
you can trust someone is to trust them

00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,870
easy to say how to do and I get and I

00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,150
think in a lot of leadership articles

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,510
I've seen it's this word aloud its its

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,740
phrase assuming positive intend it's

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,240
something they never really sit right

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,700
with me I kind of have Drive into it a

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,860
bit more as well it's not quite the same

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,490
because when you are assuming positive

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,780
intent it minimizes ones feeling

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,979
policing their reaction and question of

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,389
perception especially there's the

00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:12,610
incident that happened and under mitre

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,680
code of conduct everyone has a right to

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:18,639
feel safe and be safe their workplace

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,680
and marginalized people feel less

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,590
welcomed and less safe in your community

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,620
and Tiffany is quite nicely linked that

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,060
our talks today that marginalizes will

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,530
feel less like a man less safe in your

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,950
community if you know if you're just

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:37,599
being quite lazy with or around your

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,430
code of conduct at work you know

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,650
assuming positive intent it's a very

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,550
easy and lazy

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,470
to go we assume the best of everyone but

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,380
you know it's just trying to enforce

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,970
trust into the team but it doesn't quite

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,720
work that way it needs to be come from a

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,949
genuine place

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,320
I mean think for me it was that well

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:00,240
maybe it comes from the fact that the

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,580
default position is well there's no

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,680
reason to distrust you at this point

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,419
when you have yeah especially when you

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,820
are in the high-performing team it

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,760
growing constantly you're making any

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,680
relationship all the time maybe the best

00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,310
default position let's go there's no

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,870
reason why I don't trust you right now

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:24,419
but what if there is potentially like

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,830
let's ball why that you have that gut

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:33,990
feel is it rumor assumption and previous

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:36,060
conflict that course that so you may

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,740
want to think about debugging trust with

00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,240
this person

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,410
use your curiosity to begin your

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,000
research I think we reaching out having

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,520
regular one-to-one conversation is

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,840
something that I don't often see I think

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,150
everyone especially in your

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,130
high-performing team we tend to get your

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,530
head down and get through the day

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,000
looking at computers and not having that

00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,650
one-to-one relation you may have a lot

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,530
of team meetings you may have a lot of

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,770
team activities but trust but internal

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:09,270
interpersonal trust really down onto

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:11,490
that one-to-one interaction gaining

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,680
insight and perspective of your members

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:19,160
I kind of beyond that how I should

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:23,250
weaken question what are their values

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:27,240
what their pains what is their

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:30,599
background and I think the tips for

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,930
leaders and managers is consider how you

00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:38,099
can facilitate that one-to-one

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:40,110
conversation I don't have any real like

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,770
good suggestions right now but something

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:46,650
to consider and how to do that

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,420
effectively so you may need to gain and

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:54,330
practice some skills how to build a

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:58,290
one-to-one relationship effectively

00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:00,450
active listening it also then helps you

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,860
build your authenticity which improves

00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,100
your trustworthiness into the

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,390
organization which is going to

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:11,700
self-perpetuating cycle you can use a

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,260
framework nonviolent communication is

00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,110
the one that I tend to come across the

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,820
most the ethos is strengthening your

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,850
ability to inspire compassion in

00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:25,050
yourself and others so it's worth

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:27,810
looking into and tips for leaders and

00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:31,710
managers to provide training or coaching

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:34,260
on these skills often that people don't

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,030
really have a lot of practice in this

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,770
skills or getting feedback on that so

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,980
this would be a really good opportunity

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,980
to spend time with your team members on

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,480
and after you build that one-to-one

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,240
relationship they are things you can do

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,380
to build even look at a long term trust

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:59,640
with your team member so have anyone

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:04,020
heard of sponsorship before you have not

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:07,190
many people so the idea of sponsorship

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,540
now being kind of widely used is that

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:14,880
supports when your idea form an

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:17,730
authority but in my opinion Authority

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,410
nothing hierarchy it don't really need

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:25,040
to like I think there's more to it and I

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:28,380
want to kind of get into social capital

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,340
so everyone has such a capital at work

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,710
because it's a social group and having a

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,930
dynamic social capital within the team

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,350
can help participants to achieve

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,840
calabria goals you and the idea is that

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:45,120
you don't need to be a manager or

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,600
someone in power to be someone sponsor

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,710
merely being a sponsor because you have

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,900
social capital to spend is a good step

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:59,250
towards building trust with your team

00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:01,320
member so invest your social capital

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,630
like putting your name against an

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,970
initiative from your team members like

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,500
and if you're any points or a hesitate

00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,370
you know

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:14,430
from that it's time to explore you know

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,980
getting feedback and getting feedback

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:21,960
from your peers on the idea which I will

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:25,710
kind of get into in a moment and if you

00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,940
are looking for a sponsor because you

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:33,630
want like someone to adopt your

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:35,820
initiative there is this ethos kind of

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,000
stem from what Japanese culture

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,250
condemned owashi if you are interested

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,040
in this Toyota wrote a really

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,040
comprehensive guide which it was really

00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,330
really good read the idea is going

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,820
around the roots you're taking care of

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:59,330
transplant the transplanting from new

00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:01,560
plan you spend the time to go around

00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,140
planning and building a consensus within

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,110
your team so getting feedback from each

00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:10,470
peer and continuously improving and even

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:14,160
finding your idea and why would you want

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,700
to spend the time on that study as a

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,490
sport that appreciation nature of the

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,260
participant management rangs quite

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,830
highly in the decision-making process

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,440
within the organization if you want your

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,080
idea to get adopted you want to get

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:36,020
buy-in and the easiest way to get buy-in

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,020
is do it on the ones who one interaction

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:44,130
asking and giving feedback so I'm kind

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:49,020
of talking about beyond a CO review in

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:54,420
this and why would you want to have peer

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:55,830
feedback system in your workplace it

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,990
promotes critical thinking and

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:03,530
higher-order learning in the group and

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:07,460
for I think the first step to do is

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:10,530
actively asking for feedback automate it

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:14,220
schedule it collate it make sure that

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,360
you're on top of this be Pacific with

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,620
your question when you're asking for

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,970
feedback I think one of the toughest

00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,759
thing I find where

00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:27,029
we are trying to enforce a feedback

00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,370
culture in the company was that we

00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:34,019
weren't really specific with our

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,699
question so think about how you want to

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,009
get out of that feedback is that

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:39,810
anything that in your presentation or

00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:45,269
any content you generator that you want

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:50,939
specific content specific advise on and

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:53,040
start from there so this framework can I

00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:57,000
chose that like

00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,680
vague you can have really vague negative

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,660
feedback vague positive feedback and I

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,509
think the best though are the sort of

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,110
first steps to take is looking into how

00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:13,560
to practice giving positive specific

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,660
feedback giving positive feedback is a

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,490
lot easier than giving negative feedback

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,189
which I will get into in the moment

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:24,329
later but if you want to take a first

00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:28,339
step in giving feedback to one yet

00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:28,339
positive is often the best way to start

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,120
consider a feedback framework I find

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,500
that really helpful that helps with your

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,899
feedback lands the first time so you

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,750
want to look into describing a situation

00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,759
with specific describe the behavior

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:48,449
observed rather than the motivation I

00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,540
think the key thing is assuming

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,189
motivation is a dangerous ground here

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,230
you do not know the motivation of

00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:57,180
someone you can only describe the

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,860
behavior that was observed and then

00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,779
describe the impact that the behavior

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:06,689
had I think four tips for leaders here

00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:10,019
is to provide role player and simulation

00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:12,629
exercise especially if someone what

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:16,170
lights our start giving sort of tough

00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:18,540
feedback having that role play and

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,209
simulation exercise really helps them to

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,209
get your feedback from you to at least

00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:28,439
get the emotion out to make sure that

00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:31,519
they the feedback can land and then

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,519
we'll touch on communication

00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:40,620
so you can also start with a framework

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:42,450
as well a communication cap new is often

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,640
you also want it to you know land the

00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,550
first time making sure that we've got

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,150
all your information right in front of

00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,770
anyone you can start like thinking about

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,720
what you want to get out of the

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:58,200
communication so you know get to the

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,150
point be clear of what the recipient

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,230
should be receiving to do next

00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:09,000
and show that you care as well emotion

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:12,240
is we're a big part of that things this

00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,810
is something that I think we struggle a

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,120
lot in the organization is thoughtful

00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:24,570
transparency and so the balance on

00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:27,150
information sharing so the the balance

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,240
is that it's not to overwhelm everyone

00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,250
with all the information the idea or

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,380
everyone needs to know everything is

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,970
that you want to create an environment

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,020
where others can trust that they're how

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:42,390
will have the relevant information so

00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:47,430
they can do a great work make informed

00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:51,960
decision and I think that when managers

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:55,200
asking me here you know like surely like

00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,640
Transpac like or like a highest level of

00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,370
transparency that we can reach as an

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,990
organization it's a good thing it's

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,910
actually a trap because if you know if

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:07,590
they if they are being you're conducted

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,610
in plain view would there be more open

00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:13,620
that accountable being observed can

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,750
distort behaviors instead of improving

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:20,910
it that's an element on privacy that you

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,980
need to get your team into that so I

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,810
guess for near leaves or tips for

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,030
leaders and managers would be offer

00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,270
feedback and context to achieve balance

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:32,930
if is the information relevant it's a

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,930
bit of overkill

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,800
align your words with action it's a big

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:44,280
part of you know building trust

00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,750
how have you follow through your your

00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,910
action points yeah come on

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,850
meetings coming out off and you retros

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:58,410
and things like that it's not a exercise

00:17:50,850 --> 00:18:00,930
to you know sort of it's not exercise to

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,670
feel you know if you're not done enough

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,370
to feel guilty about is really

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,800
exercising your evaluation have you done

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:11,760
in you know have you follow-through

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,400
often not often or have you let things

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,180
slip the crack and if that have been the

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,090
case what's your instinct on delegation

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,740
or asking for help because that would

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,880
exercise your critical thinking on your

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,070
workload management and tips for

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,920
managers is to offer support in this

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:35,520
area I think intrinsically people don't

00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:40,680
tend to view delegation they're asking

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,870
for help a positive behavior but it is

00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,010
it will help your team to take on more

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,830
team members taking more responsibility

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:49,200
and you feeling less overwhelmed if

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:54,090
you're burnt out your team members will

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:58,080
suffer and we're going on to building

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:01,110
trust with managers making the most of

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,730
your one two ones I think that kind of

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,250
mistake here that people tend to use

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,500
one-to-ones as a status report there are

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,660
other means you know other team meetings

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,270
that you can offer your status report

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,400
and once one is a rare opportunity that

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:16,650
you have with your managers to you know

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,400
get the most out of your time spent

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:23,180
together focus focus on getting context

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,800
of the work that you're currently doing

00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,810
it's important to discuss blockers

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,140
challenges and success with your

00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:34,440
managers they can give you you know a

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:36,180
ton more insight and context with your

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,740
work they help you to get through the

00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,690
next phase of your project and it's also

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:47,010
opportunity to ask what's on their mind

00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:49,530
often managers would have a broader view

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,860
as to you know risks and opportunities

00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:57,000
in the organization so you can work with

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,900
them on you know mitigating risks and in

00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,900
an innovate

00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:07,200
preparation is key so often people wants

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,300
you on your pitch new initiatives ideas

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:14,860
technology adoption - you know managers

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:17,440
tech leads and often yeah you you want

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,550
to go prepared with all the information

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,310
they would need to do that and all of

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:28,870
them find that three is the magic number

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:32,880
if you go in with various option three

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:35,560
options to your managers will take lead

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,780
they will often then follow this because

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:41,440
I've got a lot principle they would

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:46,690
choose the one that is probably the one

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,930
that you have in mind already and the

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,630
managers on your side it's okay to ask

00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:58,420
for them for their help and it's okay to

00:20:52,630 --> 00:21:00,610
talk things out so I think for leader

00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,580
manager is to provide the physical and

00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:07,090
emotional space for holding this sort of

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,000
on this conversation especially if

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,590
things are not going so well

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,550
often people I look sort of fear of

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,530
speaking out and they kind of mentioned

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,120
about physical space I think in a lot of

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,120
places that people tend to hold they

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:27,580
want to one's very near into earshot of

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:30,730
other people that seems to have a real

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,670
impact on the quality of the ones who

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,820
ones because people want to be able to

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:39,550
have the space and the mental space to

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,070
be vulnerable in that moment that can

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:46,870
feel trust between yourself and your

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:50,950
managers your managers is also on your

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:55,990
team human and have a very similar needs

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:57,130
as your peer and we are approaching at

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,300
the end of our journey

00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:04,840
I think it's a build trust effectively

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:09,310
is to be consistent tenacious and

00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,740
dependable it will take time hard work

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,690
and dedication

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,820
but it's all worth it because it's a

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,540
part of being in or building a

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:23,570
high-performing team so I will end on

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:27,410
this quote a trust is earned in the

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:32,690
smallest moments not through heroic

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:34,240
deeds or even highly visible action but

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:39,640
if we're paying attention

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,640
listening genuine care of connection

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,320
so this talk wouldn't happen unless

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,140
follow the amazing and may mostly fly

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,950
people couldn't ask for more fellow

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,280
colleagues really and that is the end of

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:59,579
my talk

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,579
