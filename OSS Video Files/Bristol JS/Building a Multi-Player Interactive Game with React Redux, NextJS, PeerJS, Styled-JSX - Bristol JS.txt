Title: Building a Multi-Player Interactive Game with React Redux, NextJS, PeerJS, Styled-JSX - Bristol JS
Publication date: 2019-11-13
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Mairead Preece - Building a multi-player interactive game with React/Redux, NextJS, PeerJS, Styled-JSX

Mairead will be discussing the creation of an interactive multi-user game prototype. Sounds simple? Should be. These things never are.

We will be talking through the choice of tech stack, including creation of a NextJS app with Jest test suite and Babel config, Integration of PeerJS to add multi-user interaction, Redux to store global user state, Styled-JSX (CSS in JS style authoring) and deployment of the app to Heroku.

nice to be here nice to be out I haven't

00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:10,230
spoken a meet up for several years so

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,700
it's nice to be here and today I am

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,260
going to be talking about a little thing

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,470
that I made and it's made out of next

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,269
j/s which is based on react and I wanted

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,390
to ask in audience if you are mostly I'm

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,109
assuming JavaScript developers and who

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,270
is using react in their day job okay

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,670
yeah half that seems about right and who

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,350
is using next is already to do their

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:42,480
code oh I thought I thought there would

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,340
be more and but that's good because that

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,629
means I might actually be telling you

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,489
something that you wanted to know

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,500
because the reason that I picked up day

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,620
next day is is that I've been using

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,120
react and I really like it and and I

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,610
didn't think I was going to like it

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,460
because I thought JSX looks horrible and

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,899
I got a job with a react house who took

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,250
me on even though I had no reactive

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,530
experience so now I've really enjoyed

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,720
the experience of learning to use that

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,760
framework and I'd heard about next-day

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,619
yes and so I thought you know one of the

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,030
things when you were particularly a

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,650
front-end developers that there's new

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,530
stuff coming out all the time and if you

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,759
don't have time to pick it up and then

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,110
you always feel like you're missing out

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,729
slightly or there's something cool going

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,860
on over there and like what are all

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,650
those people doing so that's partly why

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,630
I put this talk together and and pick

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:33,990
something up and why why why did I make

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:37,680
this thing and I was looking for work

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,049
and I was contacted by a recruitment

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,509
consultant and they said you know have

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,850
you got any work you can show and the

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:47,369
answer is no because if you look at my

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,470
github I saw these three ages ago github

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,990
is not my resume it's more like a field

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,110
of broken dreams and I like this one too

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,840
github is a graveyard of good intentions

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,969
because I use my github account to make

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
things that are fun for me there ik

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,310
there sorts it's like a sketchbook it's

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,500
not real code and I have been working as

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,390
a developer for 15 years so I've written

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,240
a lot of production code but that

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,160
belongs to my employers and

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,810
under NDA or it's someone else's

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,870
intellectual property and I can't just

00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,010
go showing that to other companies just

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,910
because I want another job because

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,010
that's a contract violation and they

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,240
said okay we understand I don't think

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,310
they do understand me he's like we

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,050
understand that and and so this company

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,780
came back to me and they said can you

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,610
just make us something anything that was

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,170
their brief and I thought that's

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,490
actually really nice has been given

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,800
technical tests when you're recruiting

00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,290
is a massive bummer and they're they're

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,330
really boring they're a time suck nobody

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,310
likes doing it and so I thought actually

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,380
this is quite a nice ask that they're

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,430
just like just make a thing and I

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,680
thought brilliant

00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,500
that sounds good what am I going to make

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,480
and I haven't made anything for a really

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,510
long time and partly because I had a

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,550
baby E and they take a long time and

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,470
partly because one of the things that

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,790
I've been doing in my spare time is and

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,560
I'm the I help out a friends music event

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,870
which is a fundraiser for their charity

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,640
and I'm kind of a head of decor which is

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,550
quite a grand name for the person that

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,190
makes it look nice and this is one of

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:23,290
the things that I'd be making for them

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,290
as like a piece of installation are

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,430
this is me sending them a video think

00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,800
I've made so I kept trying to tell them

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,870
what it was and they didn't work out and

00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:39,890
this is like a bank of sensor sees a

00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:50,330
capacitor and it's a bank of letters

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:55,489
made out of LEDs enclosing home out of a

00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,930
hundred lots of Arduino sensors and I'm

00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:58,550
really pleased to they're proud of it I

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,519
really like making this kind of

00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,900
interactive code it's something that I'm

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,250
really into and the reason that I'm a

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,470
front-end developer and a JavaScript

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,209
developer is that I like use their

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,069
interaction coding and I like making

00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,110
things happen and touching stuff and

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,090
seeing it happen so when they were like

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,400
making thing I said okay what can I make

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,579
and can I turn this really nice idea

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,139
that I had for together like the idea in

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,570
case you couldn't see is that the rate

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:25,460
sensor you can't touch them all at once

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,979
so you are gonna have to do it with

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,810
another person and do it together and so

00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:33,140
the idea is that everyone comes in

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,780
together and that's that's my the

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,810
thought that I had behind this piece so

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,610
I was thinking about like if I'm gonna

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,500
make that happen on a browser and I want

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,870
multiple people connecting to a browser

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,610
light and what am I gonna need to do to

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,760
make that happen and I think originally

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,080
like it said Redux on my and I think

00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,910
originally I was thinking that I would

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,320
need to say in the stuff in to state so

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,539
when everyone connected that I would be

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,010
holding the global stay in state and

00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,750
actually I moved away from that idea and

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,970
it didn't take redux off there is no

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,950
Redux in this experiment I'm going to

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,960
show you and I remembered that I done

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:10,930
something before with phis which is

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,740
using a web RTC protocol and pjs is a

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,810
JavaScript library it sits in your

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,940
client and it makes a request to a

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,160
signal server and that way multiple

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,370
browsers can all communicate to each

00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,870
other em and I was really excited about

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,340
this because it's a really long time

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,229
since I've made anything this is the

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,050
first project I've made for myself to

00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:31,700
make a webpage or something out of

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,590
JavaScript code for myself for ages and

00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,419
I'd forgotten what that feeling was so

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,070
feeling really excited about writing

00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,770
websites because sometimes

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,870
can be a drag and and I think because I

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,610
got overexcited I don't know if anybody

00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,230
is guilty of this you know you think oh

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,760
I'm gonna make myself a blog and then

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,070
you're like well so I'm doing that I'm

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,660
gonna learn a new framework and then you

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,640
find yourself in there now I've got to

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,560
learn a new build system and then you're

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,390
like me you've just waded out into this

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,310
massive new tech stack that you thought

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,020
would be really exciting you haven't

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,360
written any of your blog and you haven't

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,010
written any of the application so this

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,870
is basically what idea that it's like

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,250
yeah I'm gonna learn next day as that's

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:12,980
sounds cool

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:17,030
and so the thing that attracted me to

00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,260
next is is that I'd done a workshop on

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,570
it a couple of years ago Remy sharp

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,670
teaches wine and he's really into it he

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,410
really loves it and he was begging it up

00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:27,590
and I I was kind of attracted by the

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,910
idea that you it gives you other things

00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,700
straight out the box like a rails

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,160
scaffold and there is a CLI that you can

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,260
download so you npm install next and

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,690
then you install the CLI and then you

00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:41,330
just type one line of code build my next

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,100
app and it does everything and it puts

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,650
in your web packet those your babel

00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,710
config it sets up a hot loader it does

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,600
your CSS compiling all of that stuff is

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,630
straight out the box and i was thinking

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,120
yes I've waited my whole front and

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:59,540
career for this to happen because I have

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,560
always hated I hated require I hated

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,080
browserify

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,180
I hated like all of that config stuff

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,130
and you're just plowing through Jason

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,110
and like how saying every time you ever

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,510
wanted to learn a new framework you also

00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,150
had to learn all of their other build

00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,800
system because if you googled a problem

00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,810
that you were having an angular you

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,480
would inevitably get all of the results

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,400
back from Stack Overflow saying you have

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,070
to build it in broccoli or gulp and if

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,590
your codebase doesn't look like someone

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,480
else's build it's impossible to follow

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,930
their tutorial or whatever it is online

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,030
so this is what made me think like next

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,400
Jas is like this is the holy grail that

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,250
I've been looking for and and that was

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,820
true for about a day I felt like like at

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,410
the best person in the world and and

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,180
like he gives you all this other stuff

00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,580
it gives you this isomorphic server

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,590
thing

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,349
which I don't think I ever really kind

00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,939
of got my head around that you can spit

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,319
out stuff from your server side so

00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:57,240
you're not building pages on the front

00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,949
and it does all your routing so you

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,310
don't need like the reactor because

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,770
that's all coming from your server and

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,210
what it does do which I think it it

00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,939
looks like it's helping you to begin

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,949
with this that it hides it is webpack it

00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:14,099
but it hides it under the hood and you

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:16,169
can plug your own plugins into the next

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,360
config and it hands them off to web pack

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,460
but what you can't do is find out what

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,449
person what version of web pack you are

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,000
running so as soon as I started to find

00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:30,060
other things that I wanted to plug into

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,250
the basic scaffold I just ran into babel

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,539
error it's like all of the builds pack

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,070
error any time i wants to add anything

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,130
and i was trying to use this other

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:41,729
person's repo that is an RTC project

00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:43,440
that he's built on top of next is and i

00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,180
was trying to take his dependencies from

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,410
his repo and put them in mine and kind

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,060
of plug all of mine together and it just

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,660
i fell apart

00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,399
like can i spend days plowing through

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,690
babel config web pack errors and I

00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,040
couldn't debug them because we couldn't

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,350
see what version of web pack I was

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,300
easing and Babel has moved on so the

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,970
whole Babel ecosystem there were two

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:06,120
versions and before like six or seven

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,190
and after and you can't use the plugins

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,339
if you're using the wrong babe Babel

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,930
core it's a nightmare and it's not any

00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,790
better than ever was and I made this pie

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,130
chart like this actually maybe you can't

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,519
meet this time spent configuring my

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,320
front-end framework time this green is

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,029
like time actually doing something fun

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,470
like this match of bagel config and I'm

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:29,730
not ragging on the people who write

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,440
these libraries because it's super

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,079
complicated and I can't do it and I

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,199
never have so it's not that I it's not

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:39,329
that I hate web pack or I resent them in

00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:40,350
any way I'm very envious as the people

00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,079
who write this stuff because I think

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,209
it's really great but I just like why

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,029
does it always have to be so painful and

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,440
like years ago I saw Christian Harmon

00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,180
giving a talk and he was talking about

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
the frustration of being a front-end

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,149
developer and how there were really

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
basic things in our industry that we

00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:57,750
haven't solved like accessibility and

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,740
writing good code and like writing

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,380
efficiently

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,930
reinventing the wheel he said we keep

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,080
running round in circles and every year

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:09,300
we get shinier shoes and this is what it

00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,339
feels like to me cousins like next day

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,140
it looks so good but it's like all I've

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:18,510
done is just put on another pair of

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:21,000
shoes and but one of the things I did

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,770
find that did make me really happy like

00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,750
because I'm using Nexus and I'm using

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,980
someone else's whole separate tech stack

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,630
is that there's other CSS bundled in so

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,220
we're just using we're using a very old

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,220
version of react we're just using plain

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,740
sass that we've bundled with our own web

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,720
pack compiler but next Arace gives you

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,500
styled components straight out the hood

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,690
as a as a component like a build I don't

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,830
know what you'd call it like a constant

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,459
so you're not compiling your own sass

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,980
and and this is CSS in JavaScript which

00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,529
I've I tend to ignore those kind of

00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,360
industry arguments of people getting you

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,510
know squabbling over technology because

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,240
I found that generally in any technology

00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,950
choice there were good and bad and

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,170
getting like territorial and tribal

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,630
about your choices is kind of a waste of

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,180
time and it also like I was very against

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,910
JSX because it looks horrible this is

00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,380
actually a really useful solution and so

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,600
being tribal about that doesn't actually

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,200
really get you anywhere and so I kind of

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,870
came to this we've got an open mind and

00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,940
the syntax is horrible I'm using it I

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,680
like to call it world of interpolation

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,890
because you're writing like JavaScript

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,829
variables in a templated string inside a

00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:41,459
string inside the JavaScript inside a

00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:43,980
string of jsx like this it does it it's

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,750
unpleasant to think about and you can

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,700
kind of move your CSS files into other

00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,230
places but you're still like sucking

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,320
strings into strings and then spitting

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,360
out other strings and but what I did

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,180
find when I was making I had I'd kind of

00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,500
put up my set of letters as the the

00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,940
application that I was making but the

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,990
page was looking a bit bare and I was

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,209
thinking like I'll put some nice

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,880
decoration in behind and what I've got

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:09,060
is these little M circles is I've got a

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,930
random number generator and it generates

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,170
size and a shape

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:17,279
and a color by picking a number out of

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:23,770
360 and I'm using HS LA which is

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:27,190
hue/saturation light em an alpha channel

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:31,170
to make the chance transparency and if

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:35,110
you're not familiar with how hsla works

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:38,170
it's like a color wheel so the 360 is

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,690
the 360 degrees of a circle so you can

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,670
pick any hue in the color wheel just by

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,020
picking one number and if you're making

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,760
like kind of if you want to generate a

00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,339
random color it's it's loads easier to

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,980
do that news like RGB or a hex color so

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,420
if you want to do this kind of thing

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:57,160
m-80s hello is actually much more useful

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,140
and and what I've done is I don't know

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,209
if you can read this code at the back it

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,339
just picks a random number and to do the

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,230
color I'm doing like 0 to 360 and then

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:07,420
I've also got like size and position on

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,209
the screen and then this is my

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,000
background gradient with CSS and then

00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:15,100
I'm just dropping all of these variables

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,620
straight into the CSS and it's so nice

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:21,160
to work with this took like an hour and

00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:24,040
it's a really beautiful simple idea and

00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,440
if you refresh the page it just kind of

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,570
spits out other colors it's just it was

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,670
really pleasing it was really pleasing

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,410
to look at is really pleasing to code it

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,650
was just a really nice technical

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:38,700
solution so and like I've fully sold on

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,660
that CSS and J's I'm and whilst I was

00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,890
building this I just happened to be

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,450
looking at Twitter one day and I saw a

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:48,700
guy who's written a random color splash

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,830
generates her out of audio samples into

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,850
canvas and it was just such a beautiful

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:57,190
simple idea and this CSS in in

00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,760
JavaScript gives you so much power to

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:02,980
put variable generation in to your CSS

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,560
and that was a really nice that was a

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,480
happy accident I came across but just a

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,660
nice kind of side effect of this project

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,970
and to the last part of it that I I

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:17,470
needed to bolt it all together was the

00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:19,990
PJs stuff which is like I was saying

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:21,820
earlier it's a JavaScript library it

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:23,800
sits on your front end in your client

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,720
you need an application server

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,240
because you need something that both all

00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,430
of the clients are connecting to that's

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,440
a central point so if you've got an

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,149
application server it sends a message to

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,920
your server and the server holds all the

00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:37,899
messages and sends them back to

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,190
whoever's connected and it's got an open

00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:45,459
connection using the web RTC API and I

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:48,279
based my work on a repo that I'd found

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,019
and by this guy mario cow which if you

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,930
want to look for his work on github it's

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,850
a really nice little project and mine is

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,010
basically exactly his code like all the

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,450
RTC stuff is basically just his and I

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,300
kind of bolted all of my react

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,940
components onto the top and and I'll

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,279
show you a little demo of it working on

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,120
my machine

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:12,459
so um I've got a little page you go in

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,079
like his project is actually meant to

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:16,720
give you like a chatroom so it sets up a

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,390
new channel for you to look at and and

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,190
then I've got a little kind of mouse

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,320
pointer that you can drag over the

00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,180
letters and they change color when you

00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,980
drag over them and that's the just a

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,970
really simple idea and then if you want

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,820
someone else to connect to the page and

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:37,089
you set up her connect to the same URL

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,040
and then you've got two people so can

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:40,270
you see now that two letters are set up

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,060
because it knows that there are two

00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,620
Mouse pointers now and you can also see

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,360
you might not see down the bottom it can

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,279
tell you how many users are connected so

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,020
now you've got multiple users connected

00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,120
to the same webpage and I was thinking

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,920
brilliant this is exactly what I wanted

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,660
and my idea was that I would put this up

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,010
in the whole room we could all play with

00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,730
it together that's not going to happen

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:03,310
so sorry to disappoint you because and

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:06,399
this is all working on my machine and I

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:07,839
went to go and test that and and I got

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,399
my mobile phone out and it wasn't

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,990
working my phone okay phone I found

00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:12,850
actually put any touch event since it's

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:15,910
not gonna work vice then I got like my

00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,500
iPad then I connected another laptop and

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,560
I realized that even my other laptop

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,899
couldn't connect so there's something is

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,810
not quite right here and like this um

00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:28,180
proof of concept is working so all the

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,540
PJs are from Mario cows github repo that

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:33,399
all does what it's supposed to do but

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,959
it's just not that simple I was talking

00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,390
to someone in the break just now about

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,890
him I've been doing this job a long time

00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,030
been doing this for 15 years I was

00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,530
really jazzed at the start of this

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,850
projects I was like yeah I'm gonna do

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,260
this and I'm gonna be really good at it

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,430
because you know it's the first time in

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,350
my life that I actually do feel like

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,390
I've got the skills to do this there's

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:51,130
gonna be no problem at all and then Adam

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:52,480
like approached me to talk and I was

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,760
like yeah I can talk about that because

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,050
I can totally do this and it's just not

00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,960
as simple as I thought they were gonna

00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,750
be and you'd think one day that I would

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,200
learn that things like code never works

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:06,850
out to be as easy as you want and but

00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,420
also for so it's writing this talk I

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,579
came up with this it seemed relevant

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,730
everyone got it can everyone at the back

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,829
redux it is a good joke also if you if

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,780
you go in looks like this search for

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,940
this there's someone further down in her

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,280
replies he's dressed up as a mime type

00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:28,720
and his t-shirt says like Star human but

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,700
he's dressed like a mime and that's and

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,590
say well I want to read this quote

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,630
outlast how he's trying to work out what

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:37,390
was actually broken I found this article

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,000
as five mistakes developing web RTC

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:44,020
applications my biggest gripe recently

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,960
is people who decide in 2018 or 19 that

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,000
PJs is what they need for their web RTC

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,580
application so I'm reading this I'm

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,670
thinking I'm a project with 400 T

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,450
lines of code last updated in 2015 you

00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:00,820
can't use such code with web policing

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,580
and code older than years stale or dead

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,580
web RTC still too new and too dynamic

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,410
apparently now I think it's actually

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,460
totally simple thing to assume that you

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,040
could have used code that was written

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,590
four years ago but also in my defense

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,600
the last time I used paas was four years

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:18,130
cakes my son's about four years old now

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,350
so the last project that I genuinely

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,600
used this then was it was a long time

00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:24,430
ago but the other thing in defense if

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,860
you go looking for anybody doing this

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,710
stuff online everybody is using PJs

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,230
unless they've moved on to like a paid

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,000
service like this is kind of like this

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:36,430
still industry standard even though this

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,740
guy who is a very sensible man who's

00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,390
telling you not to use it and the reason

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,790
for that is like it's not the whole

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,650
solution and it's not everything that

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:47,560
you need to know to do this kind of work

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,730
and so I found this really nice diagram

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,190
there were loads of really boring

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,320
diagrams of

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,620
servers on the internet but I like this

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,960
one because it's got little cute cats

00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:00,690
this is M by written from an article by

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,970
this guy Mahmud Rubin about using kind

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,310
of WebRTC and IDs and what it's showing

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:09,650
you is two people two cats trying to

00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:12,000
connect to each other and the levels of

00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:14,670
application server that you need to be

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,200
able to do this over a network so when

00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,360
you have got a machine the reason that

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,310
both of my web pages could talk to each

00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,620
other paas is that they're in the same

00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,660
network address they're on my same

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,380
machine so your network address

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:32,490
translation your na T is not necessarily

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:35,070
like publicly available to everybody

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,690
else and if I wanted all of you in this

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,730
room to be connecting to me especially

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:40,350
over your mobile phone device then

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,060
you've all got other kind of public

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,520
facing network addresses and I have to

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,380
be able to use something that will give

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,510
that to me and you can't necessarily do

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,880
that for free you need to pay someone

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,470
and Google have got some of their own

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,420
servers but from what I could tell from

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,740
the research they don't work so if you

00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,990
want to do this stuff you need to be

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,540
paying and what you're paying for is

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:04,080
somebody that's operating these and turn

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,630
servers and stun servers so this is you

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,850
you and your local area network whatever

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,530
your computer is this is your

00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,650
application server that you want to be

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:16,560
sending messages over and you need to

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:19,080
send an IC e connection that lets you

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,480
find other people on the public Internet

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,730
and for that you need to be using a stun

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,020
server and if you can't pass the

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,940
messaging that you've got through the

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,040
stun server because whatever device

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,170
you're trying to connect to doesn't have

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,090
enough capability to use these things

00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:35,280
then you're going to also need a turn

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,350
server and that's like a messaging like

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,690
a shuttling system so you're gonna need

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,030
like several layers of this kind of

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,840
server architecture to be able to

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,870
communicate which is a shame so I was

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,700
hoping that we'd all be able to touch

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,230
the thing that I've made but it turns

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,140
out it's loads more complicated than

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,850
that and I also put together a little

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,380
glossary of things because it gets quite

00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,970
confusing if you're not used to the

00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,890
language when you start kind of

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,250
researching into it gets a bit confusing

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,330
so UDP is what we use to send anything

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,790
over the Internet

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,820
any network traffic we're sending by UDP

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:15,600
MS DP is the protocol that it's using

00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,150
when it wants to find public address it

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,460
needs to send some kind of session

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,440
information to get the IC e the ICS

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,290
their interactive connectivity

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,610
establishment so the IC e servers is

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,240
going to get it's sending those

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:32,430
communication handshakes over SDP and

00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,890
stun is session traversal utilities for

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,260
n ATS your na T's your network address

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,110
translation and it's using a stun server

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,250
to send staff over the network over the

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:46,320
public-facing

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:49,020
and and this turn travel traversal using

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,480
relays around nak the tongue the turn

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,340
servers are the shuttling system so if

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,720
you can't communicate just with the stun

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,170
you might need to send it through the

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,050
turn and and there's a lot of jargon

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:04,410
there I did find this really nice little

00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:08,130
website that someone set up called Tess

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:10,170
WebRTC which is a page of connectivity

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,270
information so you can look on it on any

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,010
device and if you're trying to debug why

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:16,260
is this thing not talking to this other

00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:18,150
thing then you can set it up and you can

00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,380
run it and it runs a series of tests and

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,360
it will tell you everything that you've

00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,360
got so this was doing it on my home

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,640
computer so it's saying I've got M UDP

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,250
and TCP I can do that with that device

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,310
but there's a warning over my IP v and

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:36,210
then also like here it's telling me like

00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:38,100
what's my UT UDP address and what's my

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,420
connectivity like all of this stuff and

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,320
there's loads of different information

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:46,170
and I did go wandering into and googled

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,900
dev tools also have their own RTC

00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:50,940
internals but that felt like I'd

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,770
wandered into the wild west because they

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,290
hadn't even put any CSS on those pages

00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,960
it's just like really confusing looking

00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:00,540
graphs and text that I didn't understand

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,340
and so I backed I was going to pick that

00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,380
up today and show you and I just backed

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,880
slowly away from that side understand

00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,730
this so I'm not going to show that to

00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,460
anyone else and the thing I did find

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,440
these guys are quite good this is a code

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,230
which you might not be able to see but

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,900
you don't really need to read it and

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:21,840
this company execs this I think they're

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,180
called are there an online service

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,850
provider that provides the stun servers

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:30,600
and the turn servers so what you do is

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:33,840
you set up your application server to

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,420
make a secure proxied request to the

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,160
xerxes servers and it tells you

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,220
depending on who you are and your own

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,720
authentication what your IC e servos so

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,460
it'll go and get you stun and turn

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,220
servers and you pay them a certain

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,350
amount for them to give you access to

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,750
use their online service and then that's

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,240
the network traversal so there's another

00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,880
layer of this and that you need to put

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,860
on top but the problem with some of

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,000
these codes there's a lot of typos and

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,010
their documentation so they've just

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,330
added extra brackets in and not see bug

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,930
that so that's kind of fun to use but

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,360
also this is written in jQuery this

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,650
feels like it's really ancient and

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,830
out-of-date because they've written this

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,140
this is to connect into your PJs which

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,210
is a client-side library that's all

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,580
written in jQuery and then when you're

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,370
creating your peer you just put in this

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,510
kind of config from them to go and get

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:29,580
their IC e servers and they've got loads

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,910
of documentation explaining how to do it

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,290
on nodejs and how to write the proxy

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:40,020
server and they've written all of that

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:41,670
out for you and but and I just it got

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,110
really it got really complicated at this

00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:47,210
point part of the reason I didn't manage

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:50,220
to get this demo finished is that I

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:51,810
wrote my own SSL which I've never done

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,400
before and I was deploying this onto

00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,560
Heroku and I don't know if anyone's

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,330
familiar with Heroku Heroku I think of

00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,520
champions and I've been using them for

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,380
years and years now they're one of the

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,690
only things on the internet that

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:05,190
consistently works well and gets better

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,450
every time you touch it and the only

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,970
other people that I can think of that I

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,830
think are this good are PayPal because

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,500
their service is continually improving

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,390
Heroku have got amazing documentation it

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,500
was really crystal clear it was

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,630
technically through everything you need

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,090
to do and I'd never written my own SSL

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,720
certificate and Heroku offer a service

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,490
and not only to create it and

00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,070
walk you through creating your own SSO

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,740
and they've got a CLI commands that lets

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:33,649
you assign your SSL Certificates to

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,480
there and they do free domains if you

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:36,919
want to use SSL you've got to pay for

00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,870
enough there hobby domains they call

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,480
them dinos but you can pay for that for

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,029
like seven quid to have a secure web

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,049
application that's using SSL using your

00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:50,360
own self signed certificate and and to

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:52,789
use the Xerxes system you need to be

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,039
running through the like secure ports

00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:58,580
and you need to be using SSL to put up

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,500
their proxy server but the cars right at

00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,809
the beginning of this project I had

00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:06,129
decided I was going to use next day s

00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:09,049
I'm using this weird hybrid isomorphic

00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:11,210
server and all of my client side code is

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:13,370
being served from an application server

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,740
and when I tried to plug in the code

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:19,100
samples and Zach sees that have a proxy

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,289
server and an application server that

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,509
does the PS messaging I tried to smash

00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:26,480
these together and I couldn't deploy it

00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:28,909
because it was throwing babel config

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,460
plugin errors and like it was china the

00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:34,460
next build was chuna compile NPM

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,470
dependencies for server dependencies in

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,059
the client Nexus build and the whole

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,039
thing fell apart when I tried to deploy

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,740
it on Heroku it's super disappointing

00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:45,139
and I think if I if I if I was a server

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:47,059
developer and I understood how to Depot

00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:48,919
any of that that would be useful if I

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:51,919
really understood anything about what

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:54,080
the next is isomorphic thing was doing

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,820
for me like I might have done a better

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,950
job of this but I'm a JavaScript

00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:00,470
front-end developer and so I realized

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:02,539
that I just kind of I've written here be

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,279
drag it in the slightest I've waded out

00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,799
into something that I massively over my

00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:08,450
head with and it's not impossible at all

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,009
like I think if you stripped it all back

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,470
and then just use the exact C's

00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:14,090
templates to write your own let if I

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,610
just done it all in a straight express

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,019
application server then I probably would

00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,639
have had something running and instead I

00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:24,440
tried to plug it into this next layer

00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:26,330
stuff and it didn't work and so that's a

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,950
shame but I think like has a proof of

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,019
concept it's actually a really brilliant

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,269
idea and I think that these are working

00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:34,039
technologies and although that the man

00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:35,269
from the article whose name I don't know

00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,059
and I probably should have learned and

00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,590
it's saying paas

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:40,029
terrible solution don't use it I

00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,129
actually do think it is a working

00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,870
solution and Sexy's have examples on

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:45,850
their code like telling you explicitly

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,249
how to use pages so they're selling that

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:51,629
product and they obviously support it as

00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:53,909
a very much choice oh and I put some

00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:55,899
bibliography sayings from all of

00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:57,970
articles that I was using to learn about

00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:59,950
this so if you are interested no more my

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,720
slides will be up on my github repo and

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:07,990
you can come and dig through it and find

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:11,350
it and finally what did I learn so I did

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,240
all of this for a job application and I

00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,070
didn't get the job and the reason I

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,749
didn't get the job aside since I'd sent

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,639
my code over them after about three or

00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:19,960
four days because I think anyone that RC

00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:21,549
to spend longer than three or four days

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,649
of your own evenings and weekends is

00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:26,110
asking way too much and then they

00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:28,899
knocked me back because I didn't put any

00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,759
of my CSS I'd left it all in line I was

00:28:28,899 --> 00:28:32,470
using var and let because I was just

00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,970
copying a staff out of whatever and it

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,799
basically knocks me about its name and

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,769
gives me a face face into you because I

00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,679
co doesn't tight enough and I would urge

00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:44,080
any of you who are hiring at the moment

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,509
and if you have intention to hire please

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,360
do not hire people on the basis of how

00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:51,249
tidy they write their sample code or how

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,169
tidy their github is and if I don't even

00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:55,990
look at their github have a conversation

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:58,240
with them because what you want to know

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,340
is like is this person do they have

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,679
creative ideas about solving problems

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:05,320
are they an interesting human being can

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:07,869
they communicate effectively about why

00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,519
they use technology choices and actually

00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:10,869
what the code looks like is totally

00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,710
irrelevant what language they use

00:29:10,869 --> 00:29:13,980
totally irrelevant

00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,450
so don't hire people on the basis of

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:19,029
their codes that on them but there's

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,850
semicolons in I don't put my semicolons

00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:24,340
in I am a nightmare but I have a linter

00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:26,289
to do that I don't do nobody does that

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,049
themselves like it's absurd to look at

00:29:26,289 --> 00:29:31,299
this project so and I sound bitter I'm

00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,460
not bitter but I just like I want our

00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:36,879
industry to do better so if you are

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,799
hiring please don't hire like that you

00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:40,450
know think think outside the box and

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,070
think about hiring people who don't do

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,990
it exactly the way you do and then ask

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:48,340
why right okay that's what we wanted to

00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:49,590
do and so on a lighter note I'm looking

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,750
for developers

00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,190
as I am really into creative coding and

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,990
I've heard about this thing called chaos

00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:57,299
camp which is like a hackers camp in

00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:59,520
Germany and you can rock up with your

00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,760
own camp a bit like Burning Man and set

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,429
up your own things and if anybody is

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,919
into making things of any kind like the

00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:10,440
could be code could be browsers based it

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,029
could be you know physical stuff I would

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,860
really like to meet other developers who

00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:16,020
are into this kind of coding because I

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,289
want to get a gang together and make a

00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,970
thing and and I'm also looking for this

00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,760
the music event I was talking about

00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,049
earlier and I'm the head of deco and

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,120
it's kind of my job to meet other

00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:28,740
artists who make visual things like we

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,200
have visuals behind the music we also

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,210
make installation art and if you're back

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,679
into that kind of thing or if you just

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,059
want to come along and find out what

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,799
that's about and we're always looking

00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,490
for other people to come and join us do

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:43,470
that as well and and thank you for

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,690
coming you can get me on Twitter I spend

00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,130
a lot of time here and my slides are

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,070
going to be up on my github repo which

00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,920
is just my name my route and thanks for

00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:56,709
coming

00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:56,709
