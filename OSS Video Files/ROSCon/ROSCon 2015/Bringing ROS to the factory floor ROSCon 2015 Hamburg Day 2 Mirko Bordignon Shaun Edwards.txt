	00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:05,819
so thank you everybody for being here

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,189
today thanks for the organizer for

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,099
putting up such a interesting Developers

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,170
Conference and as I was introduced by

00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,080
the Chairman so yeah we affirm the Ross

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,970
industrial consortia from from no for

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,250
APA we're managing the eris in the ASEAN

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,539
consortium Europe my colleague here Sean

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,330
Edwards from southwest research

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,359
institute 0mb health of the Earth's

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,000
industrial consortium America's so we'll

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,920
give you an overview of what the to

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,469
confer shadow and actually of the wider

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,520
or industrial construction project which

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,710
is much more than the consortium itself

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,050
so i'll give you an overview of what is

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,210
it like from an ecosystem business if

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,579
you want perspective and the second part

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,360
of the talk Sean will give you a more

00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,460
technical side so we've seen incredibly

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,770
good things here at ruskin and like it's

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,120
progressing very fast but still the

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,680
focus might be serviced and research

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,530
robotics though it's moving fast into

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,670
products as we know but actually we

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,670
might want to connect to the internet

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,330
for the videos you know if you can't

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,710
find a cable for them yep so why then

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,869
rest industrial so it can really use the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,729
stuff to pushing us robotics from what

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,100
we could you know sympathize summarized

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,080
as pre-programmed motions which most

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,759
industrial robots will do today do

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,320
something using perception in the loop

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,720
then a milky generate the trajectories

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,939
plus all the very nice tools that are

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,860
around allowing the bag visualization

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,079
simulation Hardware independence that

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,520
present Ross can buy you those are

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,579
really of great value to industrial

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,610
users but after the wider then how do we

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,070
do that so now it's three years roughly

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:48,750
since the project started from the

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,909
intuition of shown so friendly too short

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,479
of a research engineer who actually then

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,920
internship at Willow in 2011 and then

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,930
came up with the idea of starting a

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,939
proper project we decided to back over

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,390
the conversion which is now group which

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,540
now view / 30 members so in terms of

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,840
timeline as I told you the whole idea

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,239
was incepted in 2011 and actually the

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
first public appearance was it early

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,450
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,060
at a robotics industry forum where shown

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,260
first publicly spoke about it and

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,739
receive some initial feedback it was

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:27,079
encouraging in this direction so fast

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,219
forward one year and actually in March

00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:32,609
2013 actually there are industrial

00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:34,409
construction America's launches I heroes

00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,599
from half of povas the manager of

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:38,459
industrial consortium North America and

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,650
there were pretty successful in

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:43,409
launching it and grow in it over the

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,239
years so now the project which as I said

00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,400
it's more than the two consortia back in

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,900
it so it's an open source airport

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,549
there's a community actually this

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,700
afternoon we will have during the birds

00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:56,939
of a feather session the fifth ross

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,500
industrial community meeting so but now

00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,989
the project is backed by a consortium

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,150
soon to be followed by the european one

00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,900
which provides financial and managerial

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,090
support so one of the first instruments

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,280
that the consortium came up with is the

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,019
so-called focused technical projects so

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,829
the spirit of the ross community is very

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,720
successful into having this grassroots

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,400
movement if you wish come up with

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,959
interesting committee driven bottom-up

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,790
approach so yeah a lot of people

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,229
federated approach coming up with a very

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,169
interesting software projects but

00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,299
sometimes it's adults with what

00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,760
industrial word is used which is more

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,340
like a contracted work thing like i know

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,810
i need something and maybe it's just me

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,879
evening so i will contract it to

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,009
somebody and you know you do the thing

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,470
and that's it so they are at odds

00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:49,739
sometimes so you want to blend those two

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,750
things and those are some of the

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:57,269
examples of the first ftp so sorry about

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,459
it and yet the the real goal behind them

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,799
is to reduce what we call a necessary

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,120
power work so if you have just some

00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:06,599
infrastructure costs that you need to

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,919
bear which are not actually this is for

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,359
structure is not actually linked to your

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,859
according to like for property well you

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:16,139
might just want to share the costs

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:18,599
teaming up with other institutions so in

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,370
the meanwhile since actually during the

00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:22,019
internship of Sean also some colleague

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,210
of mine from from over IP where it will

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,919
at the same time and it kept in touch so

00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,160
there were some initial exploratory

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,820
events in Europe

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,070
to assess whether something similar

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,780
would have been successful actually I

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,490
was myself an attendee of the first Ross

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,200
industrial conferences judgment well at

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,870
the time I was working at a system

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,790
integrator and a gb manufacturer so I

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,030
saw the potential for it actually coming

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:47,860
from industry and I also the success of

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,310
that event made it such that the

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,890
decision was to move forward so that one

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,000
year after bit over one year after the

00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,490
Ross industrial construction North

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,230
America was launched in June 2014 the

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,450
gentleman came up with Ross industrial

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:04,390
construction Europe which again managed

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,830
for iphone or APA and with Technical

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,110
University of Delft as a scientific

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:13,360
advisor so one of the other missions of

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:17,650
the conversion is actually to spread the

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,510
word as I said industry has a quite some

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,970
benefit to rate from rust but they are

00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,610
used to a completely different set of

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,380
technical tools and they have a lot of

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,970
technical staff which is trained with

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,390
two years completely different

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,580
technologies so training is quite

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,890
valuable to them so we hold training

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,650
sessions regularly both at the jury in

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:41,200
Texas and Ally PA in Germany there are

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:43,870
other outreach events at which we speak

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,660
in industry venues and businessmen use

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,030
about the benefits of such an endeavor

00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,040
and actually I can tell that you even

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,980
though my tenure at IP is relatively

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,380
short but I'm seeing good progress in it

00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,850
so I think people out there are

00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,650
realizing that at least they cannot

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,990
ignore us and actually that might just

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,290
benefit from it so it's a scan a long

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:09,669
way since what I heard from industry

00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:11,530
representative in 2012 so another very

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,030
encouraging thing is that we start

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,350
seeing Ross and industrial products and

00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,820
settings so a couple of very interesting

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,410
example since it's now we're talking

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,410
factory floor and very traditional

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,630
settings so metal welding big robots

00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:27,550
moving metal parts so this is an example

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,050
of a motion controller right by an

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,060
Italian company with this Italian system

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,919
integrator which actually ported there

00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,250
Cirrus library it's an SEC

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:38,590
single-threaded library implementing

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,849
some of the sub features of some of the

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,909
features of us a subset of the features

00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:47,319
and yeah it's open source as you see it

00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:49,969
has been contributed early this year and

00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,039
they use it as a real product this

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:54,050
motion controller but it's also use the

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,539
very interestingly it has the middle way

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,969
to glue different modules of a letter

00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,909
processing plant for a big company which

00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:04,009
has clients all over the world the first

00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:07,069
prototype was in Italy and other

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,689
interesting examples are Russian ATVs

00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,729
starting from the beginning of this year

00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,729
operating at a major car manufacturing

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:16,129
plant in German by German manufacturer

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:18,559
of ITV with the help of run over IPA for

00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:20,659
integration of navigation and other

00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,589
advanced features using Ross and again

00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:26,119
what I heard in 2012 at the first

00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,740
kickoff meeting actually the first

00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,509
exploratory meeting because the kickoff

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,519
would have been one year later was now

00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:33,499
this wing cannot work it's open storage

00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,349
and dicing since site licensing isn't

00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:38,869
clear but actually we have it running in

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,909
one of the countries which probably the

00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:43,789
strictest safety regulations around so

00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:46,099
it can be made to work and not the

00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:48,019
examples for intermetallics for the

00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,610
palletizing the nice product coming out

00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:53,059
of magazine oh and many more fetch

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:56,959
Baxter so it's it's coming there so both

00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:58,999
in a factory floor and products as I

00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,399
said it's not just about the two

00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:03,469
consortia I have lively community and

00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,789
again I encourage you to join us during

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,879
the birds of a feather session this

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:09,979
afternoon room 121 west wing for our

00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,329
fifth community meeting these are some

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:12,769
of the examples of the topic song could

00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,990
something could be a bit boring like

00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:17,389
towards a single Universal rubble driver

00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,619
or Oh what are the Keuka Eva drivers

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:19,999
around but that's necessary that's

00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:24,409
necessarily those of the topics that we

00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:29,059
want to sink in to move forward with a

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:31,309
project so now we get to present day so

00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:34,069
what's cooking right now so we have a

00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,839
few proposals for ftps and candidate

00:08:34,069 --> 00:08:38,269
topics which are maturing into FTB

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
proposals so this is launching right now

00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:41,240
and you can find it already so you go to

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,969
rush in the shadow tower you find a

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,910
template for the ftp it's a umbrella

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,010
project called cat to rush workbench so

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,569
it's played as often happens with our

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,050
ftp isn't different while in few

00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,830
milestones but the news is that we're

00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,440
trying a high

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,150
approach this time so we have a one of

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,870
our members who committed to fund the

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,730
first milestone but then the the thing

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,590
is through crowdfunding we can liberate

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,780
the source which could normally be kept

00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,790
closed for two years if we get to a

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,520
fraction and you get the binary if you

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,350
commit the crowdfunding money so it's

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,470
will be interesting to see if this

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,270
hybrid approach works because we know as

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,160
you know we have to balance between the

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,110
two approaches as I said before the

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,610
bottom-up community driven and the

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:28,100
contracted work guys will typically

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,110
would like to keep what they pay for so

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,170
this could be a nice middle ground and

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,690
then another two topics that are brewing

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,700
here in Europe is bringing this NCC

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,680
library on plcs we said we already

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,080
started working on it collaboration with

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,180
a major plc manufacturer here in Europe

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,830
and again having one foot in industry

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,480
and one foot in this kind of communities

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,040
it's interesting to hear their comments

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,870
they're like oh we heard about this rush

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,540
to buy now but why are they going with

00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:59,570
dds so don't you know that industry

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,010
happen also this industry 4.0 initiative

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,620
here in Germany but pretty weak in

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,360
Europe over so it uses OPC UA as a

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,150
communication standard so we're looking

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,010
into having a pilot project like coming

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:13,190
with a with a prototype or rusty opener

00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:17,050
with OPC UA there's a draft for a white

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:20,960
paper online which mimics the rostra dds

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:25,490
paper about assessing whether OPC way

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:28,040
could be doable as a middle word so as I

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,780
said we agree over 30 members and I'm

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,450
also very happy about the feedback that

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,610
I had during those two days and you know

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,230
we won't like to thank our members for

00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,420
their continued support and we look

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,640
forward to an even more extended family

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,520
so thank you for your attention and I

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:48,730
will now pass the mic to my colleague

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:53,360
Shaun Edwards so I'm going to focus on

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:56,180
the technical aspects of the Ross

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,070
industrial project Mirko did a really

00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,670
great job of laying out sort of the

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:04,160
ecosystem or the business part of Ross

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,670
industrial which i think is equally as

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,610
important as the technical side but you

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,279
know I think everybody knows

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:20,760
room is very interested in technical

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:23,730
details so look there we go all right it

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,180
does not seem to like this but we'll

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,860
move forward so in the very beginning

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:34,350
this was four years ago we were at

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:37,470
Willow Garage both Willow Garage yaskawa

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,620
and Southwest Research came together and

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,760
they you can try if you want they came

00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,880
together and they basically said hey

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,990
we'd like to take Ross which was limited

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,630
to service robotics and you know in

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,089
research institutions and deploy it on

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,089
an industrial system see if that was

00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:59,579
even possible you know from a technical

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,980
perspective we can see how it was all

00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:05,240
how it all could be done and we were

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,190
understand and we understood that you

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,200
know is it you know because Ross was

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,360
developed to be robot agnostic that that

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,160
should be possible but nobody really

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,769
believed it and certainly not in

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,100
industry when it comes to industrial

00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:21,810
robots they're very proud of the the

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,970
software and the capabilities that they

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,529
have they were impressed by what they

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,060
saw at Willow Garage but they didn't

00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:34,769
make the connection that they could then

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:36,300
they could leverage that work so the the

00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,880
most impressive thing that Willow Garage

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,670
is doing at that time was the PR to kind

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,769
of pick and place application I still

00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:48,260
think it's impressive today to see and

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:52,860
it basically integrated 3d perception

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:55,140
for identifying objects and then the

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,500
kind of intelligent path planning like

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,250
you saw and move it for grasping objects

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:04,170
off a table and putting them somewhere

00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,480
and so this is this a really advanced

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,390
capability in industry you couldn't

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,160
actually buy this capability and if you

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:15,060
had to develop it yourself it was going

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:20,320
to be very cost intensive so what you're

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:22,690
seeing here is the pr2 performing the

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,140
the pic in place this is a video I'm

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,850
sure a lot of us are very familiar with

00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:31,360
but it's still very impressive in its

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:34,810
own right and then what you see is the

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,120
same software running on industrial

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:40,930
hardware and so this is a motorman

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,990
manipulator they were one of our

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:48,670
partners in this effort and this alone

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:50,080
really sold industry on hey Ross is

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:54,190
something to pay attention to because

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:57,370
look what it can do there's some some

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:59,080
fun movement path planning there too at

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,840
that time it was our navigation so I

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,180
can't really blame move it so what this

00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:07,510
really did is demonstrates software

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:14,980
portability and it got industry to buy

00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:17,820
in right there we go all right so after

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,590
we got industry to buy in we started

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,960
this idea of developing these consortium

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,060
so we spent the next part of a year

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:30,220
trying to get that consortium in place

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:32,170
and we went out to industry and we said

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,270
hey look at Ross industrial we got one

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,250
video is it awesome and they say yeah

00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,130
it's awesome but I don't like that robot

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:42,660
you know I like my robot my favorite

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,660
robot is yellow or orange

00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,730
it's the way it is so we spent that time

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,170
in addition to like going out and

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,990
talking to a bunch of companies and

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,350
trying to get their buy-in we spend a

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:02,890
lot of time developing a support drivers

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,200
for other industrial platforms and we

00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,810
see this as a core reason for Ross

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,910
industrial a lot of these robots are

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,220
very expensive not a lot of universities

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:15,310
and certainly not a lot of you know

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,080
developers have access to them we're

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,690
lucky in that we got access to a lot of

00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,880
these platforms in our labs so we would

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,430
provide driver support the connections

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:31,930
between these industrial platforms of

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:34,690
any color and and and Ross right and we

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,459
would do it in a way that you could use

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:41,860
any one right there would be no vendor

00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:44,520
lock-in that's a core tenant of Ross so

00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,950
we did a BB adapt fanuc motorman and

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,860
universal early on and I have to say I'm

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:55,390
really thankful to you know Southwest

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,310
Research tu delft and franja for IPA for

00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,399
continuing to maintain these drivers

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,589
it's it's been like three years now but

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,149
you know things need constant

00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:09,790
maintenance in the future you know we do

00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:14,529
expect other companies like cuca epson

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,690
Stahli to come in and Ragnar which is a

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:20,140
new robot by blue workforce is one where

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,000
we're working on actively right now but

00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,950
at this point we're we're kind of

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,120
expecting vendors to come to us because

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:31,149
you guys are doing great things and you

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,510
go to companies and you say hey do I

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:36,279
have Ross support for my robot and if

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,190
they don't you say okay I'm not going to

00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:41,079
buy it I'm going to buy some other robot

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,980
that's driving their behavior and I

00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,980
really appreciate it

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:53,600
I will say that as soon as we had one

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:55,760
arm working with Ross there was a lot of

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,400
interest in getting to arms working with

00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:02,090
Ross and that effort was actually

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:07,250
spearheaded by franja 48 IPA and Mota

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,800
man and I again it's it's not a huge

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,990
technical leap to go from one arm to two

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,600
arms but there was some driver

00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:19,370
development that had to be done and

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,819
there was you know what I will say is

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,630
that Ross has really good support

00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,610
relatively speaking i mean it's not

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,459
great but a good support for kind of

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:31,040
dual arm motion planning task planning

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:34,220
those kinds of things a lot of that

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,620
enabled by move it so we're very happy

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,720
for that but it really does compete with

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,400
industry you know industry is excited

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,550
about two armed robots because they look

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,770
like people but the tools just really

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,860
aren't there yet and you know with tools

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,650
like move it we can we can really bring

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,720
it to the next level you know the idea

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,710
behind two armed robots are drop-in

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:59,800
replacements for people that that means

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,830
we need intelligent software as

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:14,330
intelligent as people for simple tasks

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:20,210
and that's what Ross enables all right

00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:22,640
so zoom out a little bit in late 2014 we

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:27,380
started working on our calibration tool

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,970
box and you know it Dave brought this up

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,920
in his talk but in industrial

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,990
applications we have to calibrate all

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,960
the time in this very painful process

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,720
you have to calibrate your robots

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,700
relative to your camera relative to your

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,890
your conveyor system it's very

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,460
time-consuming it's not always very

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:49,550
accurate but we felt there needed to be

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,440
more support within Ross and hopefully

00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,170
come away with better calibrations than

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,120
you can with commercial software this

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,010
effort was funded by Southwest Research

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,530
and missed

00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:03,260
and we really wanted to address three

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,380
core problems robotic camera calibration

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:10,820
where the camera is fixed so the cameras

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,070
looking back at the robot robot to

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,110
camera where the camera is actually are

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,480
mounted so it's moving on the end your

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,580
end effector and then camera and a

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,490
camera or many camera too many other

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:26,720
cameras so these were our three kind of

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,720
cases we wanted to address and we did

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,180
that developing a very general framework

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,290
for calibration so we had our we have

00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:39,650
our our eyes on future applications the

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:42,080
core of that toolbox is a nonlinear

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:45,350
optimization library from google called

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,770
series and the great thing about series

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,910
is it allows you to develop a

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:53,390
calibration tool box that is very

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,010
general purpose although maybe not so

00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,180
easy to use because it's so general

00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:02,180
purpose so we developed that and it's

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:04,640
been very successful I did say it wasn't

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,370
necessarily easy to use even for myself

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,160
so when I have to calibrate a robot to a

00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,530
camera I walk down the hall to dr. chris

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,800
lewis who wrote the calibration tool box

00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:18,140
and i say give me the config file to

00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,090
calibrate this system it's very

00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,030
convenient that i get to do that not

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:26,840
everybody here can have that that

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:28,220
ability so you know in the future what

00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,590
we're going to develop over the next few

00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,800
months are templates for these common

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,350
use cases and that should make this this

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,710
very powerful library very easy to use

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:42,140
for these typical use cases the other

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,940
improvements will make is streamlining

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,830
intrinsic and extrinsic camera

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,990
calibration so currently you have two

00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,890
intrinsically calibrate all of your

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:53,420
cameras and then do the extrinsic

00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,640
calibration which includes robot to a

00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,970
camera camera to camera those kinds of

00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,740
things we'd like to streamline that so

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,960
that it happens much quicker and maybe

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:10,610
happens all at the same time I'm going

00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,539
to skip that video for time so after we

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,669
developed a calibration

00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:16,249
in toolbox we set our sights on path

00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:19,340
planning and Dave kind of hinted at some

00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:21,320
of this path planning and I'm going to

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,080
give a later talk on Descartes the

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,639
library that we implemented for past or

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,950
one of the libraries that we implemented

00:21:25,639 --> 00:21:30,499
for path planning so here I'll just give

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,539
you a little bit of the overview of what

00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:36,649
we decided to tackle related to path

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:39,200
planning so in an industrial application

00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:42,440
you know the requirements are a little

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,039
bit more rigorous if for no other reason

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,429
then it's kind of a perception issue so

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:52,849
if I told somebody in a factory hey when

00:21:49,429 --> 00:21:55,369
my robot does you know the same motion

00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:57,529
right going from point A to the same to

00:21:55,369 --> 00:22:00,409
a similar point it might choose a

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:01,970
different way to get there nobody's

00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,769
really comfortable with that on the

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,840
factory floor it has to be very

00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:07,909
predictable motion so it has to be

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,279
repeatable if I give it the same start

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:15,440
and end goal I should get a very similar

00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:17,779
answer it also has to be scalable it you

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,669
know move it at this point is really

00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:23,869
developed for solving some pretty

00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:26,179
complex problems but at the same time it

00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:28,340
gives some pretty complex answers when a

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,080
simple answer such as just joint

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,409
interpolated motion might have worked

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,679
just fine so we needed to create plat

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:39,080
planners that solved easy problems very

00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,330
quickly but also could scale to the

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,389
complexity of problems that that move

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,889
it's better suited for and all this kind

00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:49,970
of leads to what we call common sense

00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:52,429
path plans so when the robot moves even

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,580
if it's completely autonomous and it's

00:22:52,429 --> 00:23:00,139
making these decisions itself it has to

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:03,470
appear like a person programmed it so a

00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:06,080
little bit different so out of this came

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,090
to pathfinders that they cart path

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,599
planner for semi constrained cartesian

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,419
paths and then the stop path planner and

00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,919
here's a video of the stop path planner

00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:19,009
we're actually comparing it to the

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,529
movement path planners so it's a very

00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:25,039
simple application we have a robot

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:25,799
that's rail mounted and we put we we put

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,200
an obstacle in

00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,509
way and we said go from one side of it

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,340
to the other and wood with move it

00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:37,110
because it's kind of a random search and

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,840
it needs to be believe me it needs to be

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,450
in order to be computationally efficient

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,899
and solve these problems quickly you

00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,749
sometimes get very odd answers so you

00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:50,369
can imagine a pure search base which

00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:52,559
would give you may be a more realistic

00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:54,539
answer but it's it's it's not

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,940
computationally efficient in these kinds

00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:02,070
of spaces so stop is kind of the middle

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:05,519
ground where it it it basically tries to

00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,379
find the a shortest distance between two

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,929
points and then adjust for your

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:11,909
obstacles you can also see that it

00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:14,429
doesn't doesn't get really close to

00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:17,970
obstacles kind of like to move it om PL

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:20,519
path planners and this is work that we

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:25,379
we've done recently and it's it's

00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:27,450
migrating into move it as we speak and

00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:28,590
I'm going to skip the Descartes video

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:35,899
because I'm going to show that to you

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:39,090
guys later so just recently this year so

00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:41,279
2015 we started focusing on mobile

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,009
manipulation this is a very very

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,429
interesting area in the industrial space

00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:50,609
a lot of robot vendors want to put their

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:52,590
robots on mobile platforms a lot of

00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:55,590
mobile platform developers want to put

00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,480
robots you know manipulators the problem

00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,369
is there's no integration software you

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,769
get two separate software stacks and

00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:04,409
they they may not even talk to each

00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:07,499
other but they certainly don't allow you

00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:10,529
to easily integrate mobile motion and

00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:13,169
then manipulator motion but within Ross

00:25:10,529 --> 00:25:17,399
we know this is pretty trivial right the

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:22,440
pr2 was a mobile mobile manipulator so

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:25,379
all that was already built in so what we

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,109
decided to do is based on some client

00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:31,049
needs in order fulfillment we would

00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:37,049
create a standard platform from which we

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:39,149
could do development and and we would

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:42,269
then open source that software

00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:45,239
and tell everybody hey here's how we

00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:49,109
built it we took a mobile base plus

00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:54,269
mccannon wheels we put a motorman mh5

00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:58,289
robot on the end of it and integrated

00:25:54,269 --> 00:26:00,089
you know laser sensors from sick and put

00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:04,559
all that together and we put a package

00:26:00,089 --> 00:26:07,580
out there that that just works we put we

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,039
also got simulation for this particular

00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:15,269
setup as well so you don't even need the

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,460
hardware to get started and if anybody

00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:19,019
has tried to set up the navigation

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,149
package sometimes I can be very

00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:24,239
difficult well here is a very good

00:26:21,149 --> 00:26:29,039
example with our Euler platform of how

00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:31,139
to do navigation and by the way I the

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,059
reason we were successful at this is

00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,399
because when we knew we needed a

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:37,739
navigation solution we went right to the

00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:40,259
maintainer of the navigation stack and

00:26:37,739 --> 00:26:42,299
said you know we're going to pay you to

00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,820
help us develop the navigation stack for

00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:47,549
Euler David Liu actually is the one who

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,309
did that and I think leveraging the

00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:53,399
community that way in even paying the

00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,289
community is a really good thing and I'd

00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,909
like to see more of it I'd like us to do

00:26:55,289 --> 00:27:04,769
more and i'd like to see other people do

00:26:56,909 --> 00:27:08,519
more so another thing we've heard

00:27:04,769 --> 00:27:11,219
recently is io network support so in the

00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:13,499
industrial space there's a lot of effort

00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:16,049
over you know decades that's been put

00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:18,690
into putting a device on a network in

00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:20,519
talking to it it's really the Internet

00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,089
of Things and we were doing it like 20

00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:26,249
years ago but you know now it's really

00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:28,769
exciting internet of things but there's

00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:31,559
a practical need for two in factories we

00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:34,080
still have these network systems there

00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:37,889
they're older protocols their industrial

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,369
protocols but we need hooks for Ross in

00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:44,339
order to use those so the first one that

00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:46,769
we did front Hoffer IPA actually

00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:50,549
implemented was Ross support for can

00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:52,760
open devices so can't open is you know a

00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:55,970
standard industrial protocol

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,820
we provide direct hooks into can hope I

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:03,260
can't open the use cases that we've done

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:06,320
to date have been motion control related

00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,410
so that's where the best support is but

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,750
it can open is a industry standard so

00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,510
theoretically other sensors or other

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:17,300
actuators that are you know can open or

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:20,960
can can speak can't open would easily be

00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:22,700
supported if you have examples and it

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,610
doesn't quite work let us know because

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,890
we want to know about those things bo it

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,810
you know the guys at IPA are working

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,840
very hard to make that a world-class

00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,850
package and then recently over the

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,210
summer through google Summer of Code

00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:42,890
supported effort we had a student

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,540
develop a Ross profi net interface you

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:47,530
know for those of you that aren't aware

00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,880
Siemens has developed a pro finet

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:54,410
protocol which is an ethernet based

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:58,130
protocol for industrial io networks it's

00:28:54,410 --> 00:29:00,410
I think it's the largest one or profibus

00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,170
or improving that together are the

00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,420
largest kind of i/o networks so Ross

00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:07,870
support for that means access to

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,180
anything that speaks profi net

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:14,090
everything from drives to sensors to you

00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,520
know robots so those are those are

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:24,140
important connections that that we've

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:26,030
made so now we're going to look into the

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,830
future just a little bit I talked about

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:32,080
all these technologies that we've

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:37,390
developed which are calibration and

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:40,220
intelligent path planning robot drivers

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,740
all these technologies were going

00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,900
somewhere you know by themselves they

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,970
solved an individual need but we had

00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,430
this vision and this vision is really

00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,810
scan and plan it's this idea that a

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,620
robot should be able to look at its

00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:57,830
surroundings and then identify objects

00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,780
of interest and perform some operation

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,360
on them and this is a very industrial

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,790
application i'll hand you that but you

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,390
know the idea is if i want to paint an

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,670
object in front of me

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:10,560
I just look at it I have an intelligent

00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:12,420
software that understands how to paint

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,130
and then I have intelligent path

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:22,050
planners that understand how to make the

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:24,540
robot actually do that task so this

00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:26,040
video there's going to be a talking guy

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,500
out there but obviously we won hear the

00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:30,680
sound but I'll give you a little

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,900
background so this is a Ross industrial

00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:36,960
focused technical project that Mirko had

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,960
talked about it was funded by the Boeing

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,190
Company and Caterpillar and they have a

00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:45,350
need essentially to blend they call it

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:48,540
blending but is really mechanical

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,820
grinding application so when parts come

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:55,380
out of a cnc they need to be smoothed

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,090
out and this process is very manual

00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,580
process believe it or not teams of

00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:03,570
people actually grind out tool marks on

00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,940
cnc parts but our idea was let's take

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,160
the 3d perception and the intelligent

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,610
path planning all enabled by Ross and

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,700
let's integrate that into a very

00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,890
intelligent robot work cell that does

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,770
robotic blending so the first thing we

00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,840
do is take the scan we then identify

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,550
potential surfaces there's some user

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,710
interaction here so the user actually

00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:29,280
points out okay these are the surfaces

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,800
you really wanted to hit that we then

00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,840
simulate that motion for the user so

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,570
that the user can say okay that's that's

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,040
what I want the robot to do in this case

00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,890
there's two operations actually a

00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,450
blending operation and then a inspection

00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,520
operation where we take a

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,790
high-resolution 2d scanner and make sure

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:51,470
that our grinding job meets the quality

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:53,910
spec that kind of in process quality

00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:57,120
inspection is very important for

00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:02,150
manufacturers and then you can see

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,150
actually executing this on real hardware

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,680
so I'm gonna let it go through this this

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,260
quick blending process and then you'll

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,740
see the arm actually come up flip around

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:17,070
and expose the the sensor side so the

00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:20,630
laser scanner and then come down and

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,630
perform automated inspection

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,720
so this is a very flexible solution you

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,790
can put almost any part in front of it

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,130
and it can figure out how to do it and

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:34,210
we see this expanding beyond blending

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:37,640
applications to painting deburring

00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:47,710
welding these are all very important

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:50,540
industrial processes so with that I'll

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:54,260
I'll just say that you know i hope what

00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:57,320
you've gotten out of this is that ross

00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,950
industrial is really a program focused

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,110
on solving problems on the factory floor

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:06,230
that's really what we want to do we're

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:08,630
very open to what you guys to to

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:12,410
involvement from you guys we want to

00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:15,860
invite people to to join us americo does

00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:17,570
a great job of doing that I will also

00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,940
say that the technology we've developed

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,370
is kind of specific to industrial

00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,880
applications you know we push it all

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:28,070
back into Ross as much as we can but we

00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,840
don't we don't feel and we didn't feel

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,370
three or four years ago that this

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,010
technology would be developed by the

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:37,940
community hence the need for Ross

00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:40,910
industrial and i would i would say that

00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,820
you know if if you didn't if you're not

00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,320
interested in industrial applications

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,840
the takeaway from this talk for you

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,840
would then be well what am i interested

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,450
in can I organize a group specifically

00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,800
focused on doing technology development

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:59,990
and outreach to to people who are

00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,750
interested because I can tell you that

00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:05,060
the message has to be targeted to the

00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,220
group of people you're talking to so a

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,530
good example is we have a lot of people

00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,960
doing work on autonomous vehicles but we

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:16,210
don't have any cooperation and at that

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,380
because of that that lack of cooperation

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,390
you know there's an opportunity there

00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:22,929
for somebody to step up and say okay

00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:25,640
we're going to create that ecosystem and

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:29,200
again develop technologies that are

00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,200
specific for autonomous vehicles

00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:49,990
considered things related to

00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:52,240
manufacturing I don't have a lot of

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,889
experience with that you know a lot of

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,220
the 3d sensors that we're dealing with

00:34:53,889 --> 00:35:00,160
these days like so the asus aren't that

00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:03,280
accurate there are more industrial

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:08,380
sensors that are they tend to be very

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,690
slow an image acquisition and that that

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,280
that hurts things like throughput but

00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,200
you know I'm happy to follow up with you

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,080
because I'd be interested to understand

00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,630
the use case a little bit more and you

00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,660
know from a software perspective we can

00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:24,460
do anything right but it you know I

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,470
think there's there's probably more to

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,470
it than I understand at this point

00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,730
well we we do host students for

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,230
internships at from afar I da not just

00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,570
from years there stood guard from there

00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,240
primarily but from all around Germany

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,790
and around Europe as well actually some

00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,400
of our colleagues some of our foreign

00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,350
clicks actually came there as a parent

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,110
student interns and then stayed and a

00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,760
spread the word back there so we do

00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:08,520
actually are pretty active and that's

00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,530
seeing and actually we are invited to

00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,270
know higher education forums in which

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,220
they discuss okay so what are the topics

00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,720
that you are dealing with now so yeah

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,720
