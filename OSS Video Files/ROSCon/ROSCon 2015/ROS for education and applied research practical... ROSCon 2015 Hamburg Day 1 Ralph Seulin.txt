so when afternoon my name is Rob sauna

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,010
I'm coming from national research

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,710
scientific center in France and today I

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,340
gonna try to give you the big picture of

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,420
what we work on Ross first of all about

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,430
the context of work we have an education

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,369
program which is an heir apparent must

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,390
envision on robotics called vie but this

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,880
is an Erasmus Mundus program where we

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,140
collaborate with two other universities

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,880
university in Girona in Spain on

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,340
hire-tata University in Scotland and on

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,640
the other side we have a Le Toux I

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,160
research group where we do research for

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,940
image processing computer science on

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,190
electronics this is a quite big unit and

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,860
my team is focused on non-classical

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,760
imagine I would show you some some

00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:01,530
examples the motivation of this talk has

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,330
we've been introduced before is to get

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,430
the idea of how we started Ross how we

00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,490
use it and we wanted to share it with

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:16,770
the old Ross community which is here

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,130
today we started in 2013 so only two

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,159
years ago and at this moment we have two

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,509
main challenges to face the first one

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,390
was to design some introduction modules

00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:33,930
about mobile robotics and computer

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,150
vision link together and in parallel we

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,020
have also to do research on development

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,380
in this field to do some internship

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:48,180
works projects applications or around as

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:52,340
is problematic and of course because we

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,750
have to optimize the work we have to

00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:01,500
choose a unique platform honest of

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:04,140
course that's why we went to ross i want

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,280
to mention at this point that we need

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,770
also to to to to face the problem that

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,940
we have people coming from lot of very

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,840
different background

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,360
we're not robots shins we don't teach to

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,130
students coming from Pew computer

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,590
science background people are coming

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,760
from everywhere electrical mechanical

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,100
engineering and everything and that's

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,930
also part of the challenge to be

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,660
addressed so i will show you how we

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,700
learn ross first very quick introduction

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,360
to this how we design our education

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,340
program for BSC and MSC and how we do

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,280
some research with an example of

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,860
omnidirectional region and i will finish

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,560
with a application development related

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,990
to precision agriculture of course i

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,980
will give you the furture work and so on

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,140
how we learned it ah that's quite

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,230
difficult at the beginning of course i

00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:01,410
remember in 2013 we were sweating a lot

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,970
to say how how we can get into that of

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,360
course we started with the official

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:09,180
tutorials from the ross wiki we read a

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,710
lot of books thank you for all this book

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,070
thanks to the authors because that's

00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,500
very good to start we had attended also

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,180
two workshops national workshops has

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,480
been organized by our network of

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,090
research groups where guy from eth from

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,760
zurich gave us very tremendous tutorials

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,880
and of course we attend to roscoe on

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,070
other shows robotic shows to discuss all

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,770
of this topic and that's very important

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:38,580
to have all of this to gather the

00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:41,100
information together how we teach it now

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,769
we learned it we move to the Alpha teach

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:48,780
it we don't intensive training sessions

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:50,519
where we do some tutorials for getting

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,110
introduction to the middleware some

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,820
students may meet human to operating

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,830
system for the first time so we have to

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,950
get a bigger introduction to everything

00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,980
we go two packages simulation basic

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,630
control of course next that's quite

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,910
classical but note with python

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,239
programming we focus on the launch files

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,940
we go to c++ programming on all of this

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,370
is the next implementing on the total

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,489
bot to platform which is tremendous for

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,669
our applications we organize also in

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:25,860
parallel some technical workshops and

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:30,090
attend or even organized in

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:33,120
summer schools we dedicated a special

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:38,009
room for the the robotics project our

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:41,189
robotics laboratory is equipped with 12

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:43,349
total boot to press other kind of robots

00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:45,750
and that's very important to have a

00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:47,819
special place dedicated for all of this

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:52,080
where the students can come at full time

00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:54,150
on free time to practice for the vsc

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,729
project next they move to the project

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,949
development you have quite a large

00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:02,279
amount of time to dedicate to this they

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:05,129
go it for motion control the integrate

00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:09,000
next planar laser rangefinder we use a

00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:12,150
robotic appear lighter which is really

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,939
nice for our our use an axe a move to

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,189
navigation on localization with all

00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,770
these different packages that are

00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,620
implemented it leads to something like

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,080
this which is quite Norris for the

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,969
beginning but they let's say you know

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,219
certain amount of time managed to

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:31,469
implement all of this from scratch and

00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:33,089
that's what is important they start from

00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:38,909
scratch and they at the end they're very

00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:42,000
motivated to have the robot running next

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:44,400
step for the MSC students so they go for

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,190
further though they do all what the BAC

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,710
d plus they add computer vision task and

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,979
the idea next is to do the patrolling

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,650
are not certain why point they do a

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,229
special task related to computer vision

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,099
so they remain on all of this and after

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:05,129
the implements Mac to do the different

00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:07,710
task just to show you those we've got

00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:11,129
the state machine we're running smack

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,339
and at every special waypoints they go

00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:18,990
for voice recognition tight detection

00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:20,099
type following 3d segmentation and

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,379
everything they're quite free to

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,909
implement their own scenario at the end

00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:25,830
of the project and that's very

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:30,839
motivating students are very happy about

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,849
this to show you what is effective at

00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,159
the end of this training program is we i

00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:38,000
would take an example of one student

00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:40,030
from him fro university of manager

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,760
that spend a few months is in our

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:47,210
university and he works was very

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,430
interested in a UAVs and he started with

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,660
a mechanical engineering background this

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,530
was the first time we did took

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,080
programming and he went into the audran

00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,890
autonomy and the art toolkit in order to

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,170
do some tag following tag tracking all

00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,790
this kind of algorithms to to do the

00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,840
real development and implementation

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:11,419
later annie is not going online is

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,240
publishing now something related to

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:17,630
patrol on indoor surveillance scenarios

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,940
so it works I mean people can get very

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:24,380
involved very quickly in this kind of

00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,660
development about research i will just

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,820
want to show you now an example of only

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,060
directional vision for mobile robotics

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:35,240
example we work with the fisheye lenses

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,330
it means very wide angle lenses in order

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:43,490
to have a large environment perception

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:47,270
and we designed a kind of special hybrid

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,790
Center where we wanted to have the two

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,610
fish rice put it back to back and after

00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,600
that performing offline calibration we

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:59,330
have a full polymer ramik spherical view

00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,940
that's becoming quite classical but we

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,070
have here a quite quick implementation

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,910
this work has been done with the PAL

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:11,090
robotics company by Jeremy gary with is

00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,180
around and we implement it to you I

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:18,910
cameras wrist to fisheye lenses in order

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,979
to do a quite real time with bit coma

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:24,110
capture of the old environment and the

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,650
spherical images is being reconstructed

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,010
later and we designed some special

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,580
packages that can be fun of this github

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,640
repository this kind of approach is now

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:41,419
being studied in order to see how this

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:44,060
kind of sensor plus verica image can

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,310
lead to better results about

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,410
localization in very dense environment

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,300
where we we can see the full environment

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:56,579
and perform some computer vision and

00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:59,129
next localization algorithms and it can

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:02,279
also be used successfully with the

00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:04,769
oculus rift to have augmented reality

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,480
perception of the full environment put

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:08,100
it in your eyes when you rotate of

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,860
course you can see the spherical image

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,259
directly that's a quite straightforward

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,269
implementation and it's working because

00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:20,370
of Ross of course and thanks to Rose

00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:25,110
last step about the application

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:26,610
development we come from burger d so the

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,610
wine yard is very important in our

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:34,949
region so we work father for this

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:37,800
industry in order to study how computer

00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:40,339
regions solutions can help for the

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,290
sustainable spray application of

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:45,959
phytosanitary products in order to

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,720
reduce to adapt the amount of product

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,410
that I have been sprayed with regard to

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,470
the relief density of the wine yard

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:57,630
right quite basic to image it means here

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,209
you see there are some holes some

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,240
missing plans that's very classical from

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:05,089
the burgundy wine yard so that's stupid

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,339
to spread some project at this space

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:10,699
there's nothing we just a waste of

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:15,329
product on very bad for the environment

00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:17,459
so the idea is to drive the tractor with

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:20,490
the sprayer in order just to adapt the

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,730
amount of spray we do at when the

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:28,019
tractor go in the whiner Rose so in

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,060
order to drive this we have first to do

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,970
a kind of prototype to see if the

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,509
feasibility was okay with this so we

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:38,970
used our Robotnik somatic cell robot

00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:42,569
quite compact for wife or robot and we

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,449
mounted on it a lidar sensor and we just

00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:49,110
rely on the dormitory with the encoders

00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:54,809
plus a gyroscope to do let's say basic

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:57,360
odometry when we move around the rose so

00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,860
when we implement it it leads to

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,260
something like this we've got here the

00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,770
the mobile robot driven in the

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,390
why are rose and you see here on an

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:12,000
embedded camera to see what's going on

00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:14,160
and we capture the 3d data along the the

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,260
movement of the of the robot and that

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,570
quite straightforward to have a an

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,870
environment measurement quite quickly

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,030
and related to this kind of let's say

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,570
classical use of their of the laser

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:32,130
pipeline nodes and so on when we've got

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:34,260
all of these data when we move we have

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,020
here a quite let's say basic

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,200
segmentation in 3d we're here we do we

00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:42,270
do surrounding boxes to estimate the

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,120
leaf density which is directly linked to

00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:49,770
the point density measured in 3d and so

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,530
let's say it step by step we estimate

00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,130
the density we have a kind of certain

00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:59,070
percentage of of leaf density and

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:02,280
according to this we drive an eye input

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:06,060
output module to drive the nozzles

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,790
afterwards so we have demonstrated here

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,100
that it is feasible the computer vision

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:13,740
on mobile robotic solution can be okay

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,080
so the next step is to embed all of this

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,080
on a tractor or not for the moment on

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,840
the robot because the tractor goes in

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:27,750
the Rose very regularly something like

00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:29,400
13 times in a season to show you let's

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,410
say an idea of what's going to be the

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,480
further implementation because with the

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,900
guys from mechanical engineering still

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,970
needs to modify the nozzles the sprayer

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,900
is not let's say ready for this kind of

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:45,450
a drive for the moment we have

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,670
implemented a kind of rendering based on

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,070
the on the real data measured from the

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:53,370
Rose bags and so on and here this is an

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:56,160
example of basic use with only one model

00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:00,180
just driven binary but of course we can

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,830
go forward later this is an idea of

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:06,900
what's going on so we're still working

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:11,100
on it okay so about Ross for education

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:13,980
and bright research really want to

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,570
invade that that's feasible we can start

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,200
Ross

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:21,920
stretch and go for it the street I mean

00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,320
quickly it needs training it's not easy

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,120
and it needs also networking to share

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,980
the ideas that's very very important

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,840
this is the message we want to share

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,360
with you today and you need to practice

00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,880
of course typically if you're not a

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,660
robot in total but two can be a very

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,330
good platform be careful you probably

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,790
all know this but the russified our way

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,350
is very very important of course if

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,510
you've got something that is already

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,000
compatible rissrose you're going to save

00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:52,640
some time and instead of trying to

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,350
ratify it yourself but that's another

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,940
story and nowadays we consider Ross as

00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:04,180
an open source acquisition and

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:06,410
processing platform for all our

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,670
applications not only for mobile

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:12,440
robotics but this is a very tremendous

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:20,600
platform or everything when you go for

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:22,790
instrumentation ok so that's it thank

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,340
you for your attention and this is a

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,280
unique opportunity to thank really the

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,440
Ross community for developing all of

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,340
that the software they are way and so on

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,340
thank you so much

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,610
alright any questions

00:14:50,790 --> 00:15:10,930
sorry deep in you yeah oh I actually we

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:13,660
don't create a map and that is let's say

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,960
the trick of this kind of application of

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:20,890
course you could go to let's say measure

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:24,130
the old rose and to create a dense map

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,230
of the old wine yard parcel okay but

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,620
it's not this is not the problem we're

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:33,750
facing right now we're doing it just for

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:37,360
let's say a few dozens of centimeter

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,760
buffer where we do the measurement and

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,250
directly just after that they say the

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,930
sensor is that the the front of the hood

00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:49,060
of the tractor and during this small

00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,150
amount of time we drive the nozzles or

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,430
the sprayer just after but let's say we

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:56,980
just forget after that what what has

00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,890
been bombed but of course later we could

00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:03,370
go for map but it's not the progress the

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,730
problem we're dressed right now okay but

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,100
of course doing some maps for monitoring

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,840
increasing the the knowledge of what's

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,660
going on from year to year is very

00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,800
important problem did I answer correctly

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,800
