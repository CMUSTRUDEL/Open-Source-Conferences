yeah oh so as as I'm sure all of you can

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,399
gather this conference really is one of

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,800
one of a kind we have people who are

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,870
just getting into robotics and just

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,700
getting in with their hobbies sharing

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,980
the stage with with people like Mark

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,129
Shuttleworth and you've got brand new

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,530
startup companies presenting alongside

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:56,219
others like Bosch and BMW multinationals

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:00,120
and we're really saying here that the

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,350
that Ross is the way to unleash your

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,629
robotics revolution that's what

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,780
everybody is saying and everyone in this

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,630
room and at past Ross cons is here on

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,880
the ground floor and as you might even

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,030
gather sometimes even the organizers are

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,979
really caught a back at how fast this is

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,570
moving as you can gather by the fact

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,509
that this conference sold out weeks

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,720
ahead of time so we definitely have our

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:28,560
hands full to expand this for the next

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,470
one I'd like to have some address and

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,930

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,820
not for most but definitely there is our

sponsors at first and foremost among

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,600

00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,380
lot easier when it came to this also the

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,180
volunteers that were rounded up and

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,550

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,800
together a great conference I think just

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,800
by staring at them

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,140
you know those were the only pictures i

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,760
could find of you they all look like

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,799
that okay well I think it worked it

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,510
worked for the t-shirts we actually went

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,970
with a different we managed to get a

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,400
completely different vendor to print the

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:23,019

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,909
weeks ago next steps so next steps we

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:29,560
will be having surveys there will be a

00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:31,150
survey to all the conference attendees

00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,620
