my name is Jerry toddler good afternoon

00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:07,109
yo you guys have heard already twice

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,740
today from my colleague Sean Edwards

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,940
swery

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,790
so I promise I'm not going to talk about

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,340
Moore's worry industrial automation in

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,320
fact we work in automated vehicles so

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,330
I'm glad to go after BMW so they showed

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,529
off all their fancy stuffs and hopefully

00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,470
we've got some tools that will also

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,500
prove useful to you I have to start off

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,420
by thanking mark Alvin he's not able to

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,699
be here but he really started off this

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,900
project and he did a lot of the early

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,550
work on it and has done a lot of

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,170
development since then but I'm the one

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,690
who gets to come to Hamburg and show it

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,850
off to you guys so you even in this

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,379
community you all know Surrey from Ross

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,570
industrial and from our work in

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,480
industrial automation but you may not

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,649
know that we do have substantial

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,120
experience we've been working in

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,430
automated vehicles for quite some time

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,070
now we put Ross on all kinds of things

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,410
not just on road vehicles but we put

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,230
rust on things as small as this off-road

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,829
ATV um this is an explorer from a couple

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:04,229
of years ago up to a Humvee and here is

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,060
our largest vehicle largest automated

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,530
vehicle at this time I'll let you guess

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,439
which one of these are commercial and

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:15,780
which ones are military yes but we do we

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,460
do work in commercial automation and as

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,979
well as military automation one result

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,890
of that is that we are interested in

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,630
both on-road and off-road autonomy and

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,799
so the tool we've developed the tool I'd

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,950
like to talk to you about for a minute

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,700
today it's called Matt vis it's

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,920
obviously a not pun on our vis but it's

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,780
a tool to allow us to display automated

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,270
vehicle work outside and a large scale

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,970
environment with all the sensor data you

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,970
need but on top of a two-dimensional map

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,799
so I can already hear a lot of a lot of

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,799
the questions are why not just use RVs

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,350
well one reason is that having the

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,970
ability to overlay everything on various

00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,810
kinds of maps is very important to us

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:01,049
and developing this tool worked worked

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,750
out very well so we are I'm just going

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,229
to jump into it and so let's see if I

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,250
can actually do this demonstration live

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,930
and

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,370
if not then it'll go to a cam video

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,810
excellent

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,030
so what I'm going to show you is just a

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,130
couple of examples of these use bag

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,020
files unfortunately they're not from

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,110
Hamburg they are from San Antonio Texas

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,340
where we are based but this is the Matt

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,780
vis interface it doesn't look like very

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,070
much right now but I promise that as

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,770
soon as the bag starts actually running

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,820
we'll start seeing something and there

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:40,170
you go so we have is just markers at the

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,270
moment displayed on a on top of a map

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,620
one of the things about map is is that

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,450
it follows as much as possible the

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,770
principle of least surprise all of the

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,960
things that happen in memphis' are

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,850
things you should expect a tool to do so

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,230
this is a large outdoor robotics so you

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,450
expect it to show you where your vehicle

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,920
is there it is there are some dots

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,990
falling behind it that I'll explain in a

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,940
minute there are sitting out in front of

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,270
it some markers those are at the moment

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,550
radar markers it shows you the the the

00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,860
top-down map these maps this map is

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,260
actually stored offline in a set of

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,060
tiles a custom format that allows us to

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,670
store multiple resolutions of tile maps

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,770
so you can zoom out and zoom out and

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,630
zoom out but then offline storage is

00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,100
limited so it turns out we have an

00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,230
internet connection here so we pull down

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,209
map data from a variety of sources this

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,190
one happens to be a very nice pastel one

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,720
from stamen design but there are a

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,030
number of these we we also integrate

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,700
with open MapQuest and also Bing Maps

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,080
and really anything else you want so we

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,590
can go back in this is running around

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,570
our test track in San Antonio it's it's

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,910
using a this is this is an automated run

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,350
using a very high precision centimeter

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,120
level localization system that we've

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,700
developed using a downward facing camera

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,989
on the rear of the vehicle and it's you

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,610
can't see them on this map because the

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,470
satellite they weren't there when this

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,970
picture was taken but there is a series

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,260
there's a slalom course of cones that

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,630
this vehicle is navigating quite

00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,300
definitely one thing you might notice as

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:04,080
we go is these nice little circles these

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,390
are exact like I said expect they expect

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,040
what you want to be part of this you

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,540
usually want your localizations to have

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,860
covariances associated with them so of

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,690
course these are covariant ellipses

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,130
they're very very small as I said this

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,430
is a very high precision localization

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,530
system and then the the camera image is

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,989
what you expect it's on the top left and

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,509
all of this

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:28,130
is delivered all of this is done as part

00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:29,840
of the the plug-in framework and that is

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,280
as you would expect uses a plug-in

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,870
framework so we connect to all kinds of

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,569
existing Ross messages as well as some

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,740
custom messages to look at so this is

00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,940
gonna be the end of this run I'm gonna

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,759
show you another one that's got a little

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,009
bit more juice to it while it finishes

00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:45,289
you can see at the bottom of the screen

00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,819
map coordinates those are coordinates in

00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:49,099
the map frame and if you haven't

00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,389
available transform to a different

00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,949
coordinate frame that will give you the

00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,409
cursor coordinates and also that frame

00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:57,229
so that looks like the end of that guy

00:04:54,409 --> 00:05:01,039
so we are going to finish that and bring

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:03,770
up yes bring out this other one this is

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,800
a longer a longer bag it's got a lot

00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,650
more data in it sadly it has more data

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
than I can show you we have open sourced

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,360
as much as this as we can show you it

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,220
have address at the end this is blooming

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,690
as we speak and so you'll be able to

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,860
download it as part of Ross but

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,900
unfortunately we have developed a number

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,000
of tools that we are struggling to open

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,250
source for various reasons some of them

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,199
are client proprietary some of them are

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,030
unavailable for other reasons but as

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,919
fast as we can we're getting there so

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,210
you expect this is a Ross talks if

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,210
there's a turtle somewhere here it is

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:39,979
this is an image of the this is just a

00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,469
robot model of the vehicle you can put

00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:43,430
whatever image you want in there I

00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:45,380
thought a turtle might be entertaining

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,630
but there's nothing much to see at the

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,610
moment so let's see what else we have

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,919
available here well on the side we've

00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,020
got all these plugins that we have

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,330
developed and can you yeah okay it's

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,639
good enough so like I said we can do

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,289
these Multi multi resolution images that

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,120
they load there either intelligently

00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:06,919
cached and always available offline so

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,900
you can zoom in as far as you want and

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,250
it slowly loads as it pulls things off

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,819
this turtle is now crushing all of these

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,969
cars so you can at all of these are

00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,620
configurable this one you pick out the

00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,880
tiles that you want to use but when you

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,650
zoom out it looks like there's an edge

00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,419
of the world the world is posed to be

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,860
resting on the back of a turtle but in

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:27,650
this case the turtle is resting on a

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,270
world with an edge and so we want to

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,029
turn on a tile map like I said this one

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,160
works but like we also have of course

00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:36,020
other satellite maps for some

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,450
reason open MapQuest has bright red in

00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,370
San Antonio I cannot explain that even a

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,260
little bit but there it is if you want

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,900
the roadmap that's of course also

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,910
available and really just that that

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,070
plug-in can hook into any tile map any

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,440
online tile map with a convenient API so

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:53,060
like I said Bing Maps is is actually

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,860
finished but just not part of the build

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,950
that I have with me right now

00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,130
what we're looking at right now is the

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:03,890
odometry the far-field odometry which is

00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,480
where the where the vehicle is in in

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,290
yellow if you don't like yellow that's

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,500
okay we can make up orange not a problem

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,360
the we can keep as many or as few of the

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,040
points as you want if it turns out you

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,510
have an incredibly long bag file if

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,280
you've been driving for hours and hours

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,600
and you really don't watch to display

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,760
the last four hundred thousand data

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,980
points you've collected you don't have

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,020
to the covariance of course to turn it

00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,820
on and off like I said these are all

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,010
things you'd expect your your vehicle to

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,150
be able to do these are the matches from

00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,950
that camera that I was talking about

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,080
earlier so every time you see a red dot

00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,660
down there that means that we've managed

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,980
to match the match an image in our

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,420
database to an image that the car is

00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,100
currently seeing and like I said that's

00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,270
about centimeter level precision but

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,580
that's not a point of this talk that's

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,440
the point of a different talk entirely

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,270
that's a system if you want to see what

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,850
the car is seen there's the the bottom

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:56,510
view but that's not super useful instead

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:58,400
we can see the front view and that's Wow

00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,740
way too big on this resolution so my

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,930
apologies it just overlays everything I

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,550
guess we should move that underneath

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,050
everybody so it's on top of it obviously

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,930
these things are rearranged able you

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,070
wouldn't expect it to be any other way

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,810
this this part where it looks like we're

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,580
driving off-road I realized that it

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,070
looks like that but it turns out that

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,960
those roads have just changed and so we

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,490
can see if you look at a different maps

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,300
that there is in fact road there we're

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:29,030
not just driving around I promise

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,280
those images are just just old like I

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,930
said the the radar this is this is just

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,940
a marker it turns out that these

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,690
particular markers indicate radar points

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,250
but we can display almost all of the

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,780
marker types in here there are certainly

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,550
some that we cannot but there are some

00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,490
that we can do that are not existing

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,779
markers

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:51,370
and one of them one of them is not in

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,640
this bag file so I can't show it to you

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:57,100
but in terms of one that we'll talk

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,649
about later is a textured plane that you

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,110
can lay down in in terms of this map

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,940
visualization and then finally in this

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,560
bag file we've got also a disparity map

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,570
so what's the front stereo camera seeing

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,640
that was not the point of this we just

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,800
happened to have it running and so it

00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,140
looks okay but not great if this were an

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,649
actual run that would look like a road

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,670
instead of a jumble of exciting colors

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:22,270
and then you've got the robot the robot

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,310
turtle all the way on the top so this is

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:26,560
this is map is this is the entire

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,149
application there are a lot more plugins

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,709
I'm gonna talk about in a minute but I

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:31,420
thought I would show you a running demo

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,390
the last piece that I want to mention is

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,220
that the frames of course can be changed

00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,600
you would expect that you can fix any

00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,010
frame you can track any frame you've

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,870
noticed that of course we've been

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,670
tracking this vehicle as it as it drives

00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,029
around but that's not always what you

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,410
want sometimes you would rather you'd

00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,329
rather just look at the at the map

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,339
without having it move around on you so

00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,630
you can fix whatever frame you want you

00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,940
can track whatever frame you want if

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,160
it's published by TF you can use it as

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,190
the fixed or the tracking frame and so

00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,149
this this is mathas and I hope that it

00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,500
will be useful to you and let's go back

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:07,060
to this let's get out of here and go

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,600
back to the presentation which I promise

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,680
is a little bit shorter than time so

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,110
hopefully there'll be some questions at

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,720
the end or time for questions anyway so

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,220
if we go back over here this works the

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,190
way I expected it to work which is super

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,990
exciting if you can say and I'm still in

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,490
the same slide fantastic so we developed

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,720
a lot of plugins for this the whole

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,940
point of this is that every time we've

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,740
got a new data type we can build a

00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,740
plug-in to visualize that data type like

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,360
I said the markers are already there any

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,160
and so you can draw whatever you want or

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,390
nearly whatever you want as just marker

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,579
messages but if that's not enough for

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,740
you we've got some more like I showed

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:43,360
you the disparity that just overlays a

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,970
disparity image that's color coded based

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,260
on depth these are all not all standard

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,149
Ross messages but I'll tell you which

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,940
ones aren't this is just a GPS fix or

00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,590
now it's an app set fix so it displays

00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,810
like the odometry message

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:58,570
a grid sometimes it's necessary you're

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,490
useful in robotics to have a a grid

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,530
displayed and Arvest shows that and we

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,240
figured we needed one too so if you want

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,490
to amount a grid to any frame it

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,700
projects it onto the onto the map

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,470
surface an image this is this is just

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,880
exactly what I was showing you any image

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:15,760
topic that comes in can be overlaid on

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,470
the map laser scans it's the one that

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,420
was not in that bag file but if you have

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,970
a laser scan message develop from any

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,640
source then that also it projects down

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,900
onto the map that can be that can be

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,790
useful especially if you have multiple

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,200
sensors and here you're working on

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,460
debugging or trying to visualize what's

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,420
going on with one of them to discover

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,190
that your laser stanner

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,140
is oriented 90 degrees from where you

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,450
thought it was that can be very helpful

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,980
like I said markers work out and pretty

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:42,040
much all the markers are available and

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,290
finally the multi res images there are a

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,940
lot of formats for this this format is

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,470
very simple it's just a whole bunch of

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,730
images that get stitched together into

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,380
tiles you provide them at various

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,700
resolutions you can don't even have to

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,500
tell us how many resolutions you have

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,540
you just tell us where to find the files

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,940
and name them well and we will figure

00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,110
out what to do with them and so you can

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,310
store whatever images you want they

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,620
don't have to be satellite images they

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,120
could be images of you know cat pictures

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,300
if you really want high resolution cat

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,130
picture maps odometry of course I

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,570
already showed you that's exactly what

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,460
you think it is it can show you show you

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,750
in whatever color you want and show you

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,890
the covariance because that's usually

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,450
very important especially when you're

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,020
trying to develop precision localization

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,370
solutions the path isn't available is

00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,780
available so you're publishing a path

00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,190
message especially if you're trying to

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,950
visualize where you're where you've been

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:29,410
or where you're going or in our case the

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,000
the hundreds of potential paths in front

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,630
of you that the planner is considering

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,830
that you'd like to be able to see and

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,780
determine where it's going and why it's

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,480
doing that the robot image is this

00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,230
turtle that I already showed you

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,610
obviously it doesn't have to be a turtle

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,230
like I said you can find a pretty

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,810
picture of your robot and that will work

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,340
just fine textured markers are kind of

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,260
the new one that I want to want to

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,700
mention this is exactly what you think

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,980
it is you would expect to be able to

00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,410
project some sort of image topic on to a

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,620
localized marker in the map frame wealth

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,889
or in any frame and of course you can so

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,589
you pass us a pose

00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:05,239
and an image and we'll sitting together

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:06,709
projected into the map correctly this is

00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,149
useful for example if you've developed a

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,069
downward-facing camera system and you'd

00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:13,369
like to place the pictures onto the map

00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,899
so that's what we've done and of course

00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,980
already showed you the tile map and the

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,109
last thing that you would expect to be

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,119
able to visualize and especially in a

00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:21,459
raw system is every single TF frame and

00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:24,079
so of course we have a plugin for that

00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:26,179
there are other plugins that we have

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,040
developed or under development and we

00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,019
are releasing them as fast as we can get

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,169
authorization from the various people

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:34,519
who have funded our development of them

00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:36,619
so as soon as we can do that they'll be

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,749
released they'll be released here

00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:41,149
sweary robotics is also where all of

00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:43,939
some of the Ross industrial code is

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,499
hosted but it's also matt vis and all of

00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,480
its associated plugins there was common

00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:49,369
earlier about thousands of repositories

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,100
well for this tool you only need one

00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:55,609
it's this one there's also a very nice

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,069
video up on the rasta org page for in

00:13:55,609 --> 00:14:00,980
case my demo didn't work and I need to

00:13:58,069 --> 00:14:02,480
show you a video instead my name is

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,929
Jerry Tyler and I will be happy to take

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,929
your questions

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,890
yes can you think the question was can

00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,230
you visualize multiple vehicles at once

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,210
of course you can they're just a series

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,390
of objects so whatever you publish we

00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,730
can visualize yeah I think the question

00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,980
was are there motivation or planning to

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,340
visualize three dimensions so the

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,450
question yeah so this was developed not

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,910
as a three-dimensional visualization

00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,230
tool obviously rviz is is a great tool

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,180
for that if you want that and we didn't

00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,280
want to replicate any of that that said

00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,590
if you have a laser stand we will color

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,780
code it for you by height so if you're

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,490
looking for two and a half D we can

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,140
absolutely do that and that's useful
