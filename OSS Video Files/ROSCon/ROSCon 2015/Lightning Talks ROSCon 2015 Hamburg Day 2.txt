hi everyone my name is Wolfgang I'm a

00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,000
PhD student at the University of

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,670
Southern California and i would like to

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,460
start off by introducing you to a bit

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:18,090
crazed crazy flight 2 point 0 which is a

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,789
super tiny nano quadcopter it just waits

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,529
27 grams and fits into the palm of your

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,599
hand it runs a fairly novel

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,310
microcontrollers the stm32 has sensors

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,980
on board and runs to real-time operating

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,780
system now it's interesting for research

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,450
because it has an expansion port

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,750
allowing you to use it even without

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,879
soldering and it has a low latency radio

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,210
where you can communicate with it in

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,309
just three milliseconds next now that

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,860
would be totally boring to you guys if

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,280
you couldn't control it with Ross so

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,680
there's a ross stack for it and it comes

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,219
with the batteries included unlike some

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,190
other packages so it consists of an

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,409
actual driver which communicates to the

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,140
crazy fly and it supports multiple of

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,930
them and you can even use the single

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,170
radio to control my two gloves that you

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,330
can use one radio for three crazy flies

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,689
if you wish it is very fast written in

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,060
C++ and it supports all the features of

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,790
the crazy fly including locking and

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,549
paramedics it works with a start firm

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,590
you can use office to visualize your

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,110
stage in the future you might be able to

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,180
do motion planning at as well and it

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,030
comes with a controller so if you have a

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,640
motion capture space like vikon you can

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,009
use that to do waypoint navigation and

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,619
it all works out of the box and it

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,520
includes demos using joystick navigation

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,470
and Bay Point navigation for that space

00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,930
next slide please now if you're

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,970
wondering why does it make sense I mean

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,250
that thing is so tiny I have no idea

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,520
what to do with it you might be right

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:02,689
however for every solutions there's a

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,689
problem so

00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,660
in that case the problem is that we have

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,310
this huge gap between simulation and

00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,490
implementation and you can close that

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,380
gap by using mixed reality and put parts

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,750
of your system in the virtual world and

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,300
parts of your system in the reality and

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:23,150
the crazy fly is an ideal platform to do

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,970
so and I just published a paper with

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,950
some colleagues at ira's before which

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,190
discusses that and it uses Ross

00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,890
extensively in combination with various

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,739
simulators like gazebo V rap and even

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,750
Sergei mentioned unity3d and if you're

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,540
interested in that please check the

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,110
paper out visit our website act or

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:54,350
usc.edu and talk to me or send me an

00:02:45,110 --> 00:03:03,890
email thank you we have Patrick up now

00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:07,040
and Laszlo on deck ok hi my name is

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:11,060
Patrick reason I'm from university of

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,540
applied sciences and awesome and I'm

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:17,269
here because I think Ross is awesome and

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:21,470
I think all of you is here because you

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:24,410
agree to this so our idea is with our

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,989
Ross summer school to spread Ross all

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,310
over the world and our Ross summer

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:33,110
school is international two-week event

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:37,340
where people come really from all over

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:41,090
the world and learn in two weeks how to

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:44,840
use Raj how to use Ross totally from the

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,269
scratch next slide please yeah a little

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,170
bit to our own history we started in

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:54,799
2012 with round about 10 participants

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:57,769
and yeah we are very happy that we could

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,650
reach this year to serve over 60

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:03,829
participants and yeah we had also to

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,390
lock the registration because yeah we

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,880
were totally sold out and

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:11,459
yeah rossitano school is every year a

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,660
big international event this year we

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,549
could serve 17 different nationalities

00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:21,450
to visualize this a little better maybe

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:25,230
on the next slide we have a world map so

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,870
you see where people come from to visit

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,750
our summer school it's really not only

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:36,360
Europe so it's America Asia Australia

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:38,640
and Africa too and next step we will do

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,790
is also to export the rough summer

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:47,130
school we start next year in South

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:50,280
Africa and next slide yeah there you see

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:54,900
our robot you can see here it also in

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,200
real this is our concept so on this

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,850
robot usually groups of three

00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,730
participants work on one robot and yeah

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:09,090
so our concept is hands on hardware and

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:13,440
learning Ross by doing therefore we try

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:18,210
to touch in the two weeks at least yeah

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:21,030
all topics from mobile robotics and we

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:26,040
prepared a little video to give you some

00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:30,060
impressions for it so yeah in the

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,640
beginning you see a participant giving a

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,540
little lightning talk so now a lightning

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,510
talk in the lightning talk and yeah we

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:41,970
have also always some guest lecturers

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,530
and some people from industry there for

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:49,440
example this year clearpass and Zeke and

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:52,289
here you see our hacking area and I

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:59,460
think now also some clips from our

00:05:52,289 --> 00:06:02,010
competition one task is to Utila operate

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,410
with an oculus rift through our paper

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,340
world and another task is then

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,289
autonomously delivering pizza service

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:14,780
one last thing I want to mention is we

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,780
also okay thank you very much

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,740
sorry about cutting off their but it was

00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:29,379
kind of ironic all right we have Lazlo

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,490
up now and eat up next thank you

00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:34,610
everyone I'm last night from the

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,169
norwegian company ppm and sorry for the

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,050
crippled presentation you can download

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:43,099
the full version from the link below

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,710
because in few minutes and we are in the

00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:48,259
robotic and the ultimate ization verse

00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,759
for more than 10 years now and after

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,500
some years which has got bored of

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,120
explaining the users press the green

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,090
button and then the white and the red

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,889
and if he's blings and blah blah so we

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,469
just started to develop an easy to use

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,440
and easy to develop user interface

00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:05,539
called flex green and the basic idea

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,099
that you just grab digits on the screen

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,379
you can script it if you want but you

00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:11,150
don't need to and these are side you had

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:13,940
no codes nothing to remember is just

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,759
images and buttons and as you see even a

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,159
10 year old japanese girl could get her

00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:24,650
cookie quite easily from an industry

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:26,389
robot so freestyle so on this way of

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,879
thinking we just redesigned how one

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,940
should apologize it's a hundred percent

00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:34,819
touch-based no coordinates no coordinate

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,500
geometry and you can do a pet as in

00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,879
projecting just five minutes if there

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:42,409
are miles of course please slice but we

00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,229
had a lot of criticism and those of

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:47,330
continents why isn't flexibly running on

00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:50,089
our robots so we just search for the

00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:53,060
best middle bar for industry 4.0 and we

00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:57,680
found rose to be the one so we

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,750
developing flexp 4.0 right now that runs

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,879
hundred percent in javascript in the

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,009
browser so it runs on my phone and the

00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:07,009
moon to just as well or in the robot

00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:09,259
controller it will be released to open

00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:12,039
source and we would like to join the

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:16,610
ross industrial consumption as well a

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,670
slide please and as you see we are also

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,930
working on

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:23,970
ross drivers and bridges oh now you see

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:26,910
it's controlling and reading data from

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,550
two turtles at the same time like there

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,550
are a lot of ways to improve it so we

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,680
would like to make better node survey

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,380
and also show all the data types quite

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,890
well so it should be just as intuitive

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:44,280
as without gross so just drag and drop

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,320
stuff and look for stuff in your feet to

00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:48,180
thank you for your attention and then

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,130
please don't immediately contact us we

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:59,370
are really open to suggestions and new

00:08:50,130 --> 00:09:01,610
IDs on deck is Carlos we have eat coming

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,610
up now

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:16,160
hello everyone I'm a master students

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:19,880
actually I've just completed my masters

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,440
at our WTH awesome University and I've

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,650
been doing my master's thesis in

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,190
collaboration with Bosch also with DP

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:31,040
robotics so here's the real time Ross

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,110
framework for embedded systems it's

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,840
basically a small embedded systems such

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:41,840
as stm32f4discovery which I tested the

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,210
framework with so there is so the

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:48,290
framework was tested with free our toes

00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:51,010
and we can have multiple software

00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:54,230
components in the system that act

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:58,370
concurrently for instance if we have a

00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,160
camera node like you can see and a motor

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,930
controller at the same time the

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,970
scheduling behavior is important in

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,940
order to guarantee real time in the

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:11,800
system so if we have a one millisecond

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:15,440
deadline for the motor controller then

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,420
this deadline has to be guaranteed for

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,880
introducing this I have implemented that

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:23,870
deadline scheduling and the whole

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,540
framework also realizes Ross

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,480
communication protocol currently using

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:35,000
UDP Ross one point oh and i recently

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,640
also tested free our TPS with which you

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,050
can program the Ross knows very simply

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:47,360
as you can see in the next slide it is

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,490
like C++ in regular ross on linux and it

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,300
also allows you to specify the deadline

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:59,300
or priority to guarantee real time in a

00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:02,390
nose header and in the next slide i want

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,970
to thank you my supervisor daejeon and

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,220
ireland for supporting me and also my

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:11,270
professors and supervised at the

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,760
university so you can use the code on

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:18,380
github it's publicly available there's

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,600
still some fixes to be done which I will

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,329
do in this month after that

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:28,639
code will probably not be maintained but

00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:34,180
your collaboration will help bringing

00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,180
this concept further I think it will

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:44,000
provide a lot of it will provide of

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,449
contribution to bring real time

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,500
properties to Ross both one point 0 and

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:53,899
2 point 0 I want to thank you tank srf

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,420
and all the sponsors for organizing this

00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,699
event and if you want to get more

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,199
information feel free to come to our

00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:04,220
boss booth in the coffee break

00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:06,670
afterwards we'll be leaving so thank you

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,670
for your attention

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,850
most honest presentation ever we have on

00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:21,040
deck there Carlos is presenting and on

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:23,079
deck is Robert hello everybody my name

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,790
is Carlos an application engineer from

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,889
mathworks head quaters he Natick

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,509
Massachusetts and today I'm going to

00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,040
tell you the story in three minutes

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,220
about the release of our new product

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,059
robotic system toolbox when the slide

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,860
comes up ok next please so our tools are

00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:40,209
widely used in industry next please i'm

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,730
going to show you an example for example

00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:45,069
nasa designs their control navigation

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,319
and guidance system using model-based

00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:52,600
design our modeling tools and

00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:54,819
cogeneration technology next please so

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,040
we ask how can we really help people

00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:59,050
doing robotics applications we knew that

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,410
you were already using our tools to

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:06,339
develop very cool applications so last

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:09,129
year we received like 2,500 requests and

00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:11,259
they were asking from one thing how can

00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,869
we communicate matlab simulink to ross

00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:15,970
so we like to make our customers happy

00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:19,029
and that's why we release robotic system

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,860
toolbox which the main features is that

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,439
now you can connect matlab and simulink

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,689
to annie ross enable system simulator or

00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:28,019
real hardware and you can be running

00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:30,189
miles up from linux mac or windows

00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,990
besides that if you are using similan

00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:34,509
you can also generate automatically a

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,059
ross node using our coder technology as

00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:38,949
well next please so to show you some

00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,079
examples you can see already some very

00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,550
advanced applications for example baxter

00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,949
playing checkers human-robot interaction

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,860
if you are using our computer vision

00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,589
tools you can also do 3d reconstruction

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,540
or visual odometry with our tools so it

00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,949
depends on you we give you the tools and

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:59,559
you listen to any application that you

00:13:53,949 --> 00:14:01,809
want and next please so we like talk

00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,549
about impact so in terms of impact top

00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:06,040
of the automotive and arrow def

00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:08,290
company's top 10 are already using our

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,879
tools you heard from Michael before BMW

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,740
is like happy customer that are

00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,339
leveraging our evil robotic system

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,689
toolbox and besides that already 300

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,549
universities worldwide are using our

00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,110
toolbox you know that MATLAB is all be

00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:22,029
pretty popular among universities as

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,240
well so we're very happy with that our

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,880
workshops at I claw and I row

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,770
had like more than 50 or 80 attendance

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,660
and everywhere like all of our customers

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:33,390
satisfied with the performance of a

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,279
product next please in terms of why you

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,170
can shorter your development time if you

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,050
use MATLAB Simulink and robotic system

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,360
toolbox well it's twofold first we're

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,700
providing you matlab ease of use right

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,830
with all the powerful tools that was has

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,080
and second the toolbox also comes with

00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,230
built-in and fully qualified robotics

00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,560
algorithms transformation functions and

00:14:51,230 --> 00:15:03,839
well all other utilities and finally

00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:11,430
thank you for your attention robert up

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:12,750
now and jin work on deck hi my name is

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,279
robert cod downing from New York

00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,420
University and I'm here to talk about

00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:20,339
our con dynamic Ross enabled or dynamic

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,720
control interfaces for Ross enabled

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:23,720
robots next slide

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,330
so simple overview we have a an iPad

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,130
running iOS and we have a robot with

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:42,050
ross and ross bridge next slide so

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,510
there's two parts to this software one

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,860
is the rockridge client library which

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,630
provides access to the Ross environment

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:55,250
the message passing architecture and the

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:58,610
service servicing infrastructure it

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,800
provides dynamic class creation so the

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,820
memory footprint is only expanded up on

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,950
demand it handles the networking so if

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,780
you have over saturation of the

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,690
bandwidth it will automatically deal

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,880
with that so you no longer have that

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:18,020
over saturation and it deals with link

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,700
failure this is important because you

00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,460
don't want to be you don't want to have

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:27,530
to provide a full Ross environment on

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:29,630
our is because you can't next slide the

00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,180
next part of this is our con which

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,870
basically allows you to create

00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:40,280
interfaces to view camera data view map

00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:43,070
data right on the device itself it uses

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,830
type introspection to allow you to use

00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,840
widgets with any compatible message type

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,300
so if you want to use a map widget all

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,780
you have to do is have any type that has

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,780
a latter long variable and it can view

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,300
that data and it allows you to use the

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,200
devices sensors and publish that to raw

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,600
so you can publish your camera camera or

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,100
accelerometer data right to Ross so next

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,020
slide and there should be a video of

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:14,300
this in action so this is a sped up

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,400
video showing that you can move widgets

00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:19,130
around you can also create compound

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,520
widgets to publish data from the

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:25,760
accelerometer the gyroscope and attitude

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:32,840
sensor to create a full sensor IMU

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:34,340
message and next slide it can also run

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,910
with turtle run because you need to have

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,030
a turtle and a talk

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,310
we can also as you can see make a

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:47,820
service request to initialize a new

00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:50,940
robot next slide here are some other you

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,180
is that have been created one with map

00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,790
and an omnidirectional camera it also

00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,400
provides canvases which are sets of

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:02,520
widgets so you can have things like I

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,340
want to display all the sensor data from

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,780
the left arm and have a separate camera

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,680
for the right arm and you can switch

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,480
between those automatically next slide

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,430
use cases for this you can have

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,130
collaborative interfaces so if you have

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,920
five people working in the field you can

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,350
share camera data from each of them and

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,930
pass text messages back and forth to

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,160
discuss who's controlling the robot at

00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,160
that time what they need to do

00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:45,930
all right June walks up and then Peter

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:45,930
and Bert on deck Chinook from robotis

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:57,570
thank you hello everyone my name is

00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:01,090
Chinooks from robotics company I started

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:06,310
2002 as a robust a co-organizer or Robo

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:08,890
stucco wall wall organizer and happened

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:14,680
to meet my seal and joined this company

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:17,590
2007 and my company is actually

00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,730
manufacturing the dynamic cell which is

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:26,410
smart and modular actuator which you

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:29,610
normally use for the joint suchly pan

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,410
tilt manipulator tech support and

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:37,270
humanoid alike so if you see some of

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:41,380
them that might be one of my sales so

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:46,720
yeah here yeah but what I I've been

00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:49,420
selling a lot of time excels I see

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:55,030
something is difficult to share sober

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:57,520
because when people build robot they are

00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:02,680
kind of competition it was competition

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:06,040
and then also they want to stick to

00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:10,150
their own code to make their specific

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:14,350
task complete and sometimes they say

00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:19,150
making robot walking real-time Ross is

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:26,200
too heavy but over time yeah next slide

00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:30,910
I found oh yeah computer is rapidly ball

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:34,380
making evolution and then also the

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:37,630
community itself the Ross community is

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:41,680
actually growing growing and providing a

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:44,830
very nice foundation of tools like

00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,360
obvious and gazebo which we also used

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:49,230
the

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:55,120
ross and catchable for DARPA challenge

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:59,170
so most of the people know Atlas is one

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,960
of the good humanoid but the previous

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:04,420
slide shows that they actually use

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:11,440
dynamics and more several teams out of

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:15,510
23 fou I was winning and here actually i

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:19,750
joined Roskin first time but I know

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:22,920
Brian and Morgan quickly and truly has

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:27,400
been doing great and we also want to

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:33,640
contribute to the community and I'm here

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:37,240
to hear from you more about how we can

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:40,960
collaborate more to the very nice

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:45,280
community and to build a very reliable

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:51,580
modular yet very helping thank you very

00:21:45,280 --> 00:22:05,110
much yeah

00:21:51,580 --> 00:22:08,680
this is the flight on deck is Jeff or

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,600
Jeffrey hi I'm Peter from intermetallics

00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,650
that's bad we getting five minutes

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,180
because we have to merge two

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,480
presentations so it's two in five

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,480
minutes

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,130
it's two totally different things okay

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,289
so the first thing is about Oracle's and

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:27,190
Ross integration so it's been mentioned

00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:29,679
in a lot of presentations so I created

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:34,330
Oracle's during my PhD and I maintained

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,620
during 10 years and round 2012 then the

00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,150
releases started being made by

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,950
intermetallics by the team at intermode

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,470
alex and we're so we're still releasing

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,049
it were releasing it to hit github but

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,870
also since Ross electric we're releasing

00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:49,659
as Ross Boone two packages and we still

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,460
we're also in indigo and Jade today so

00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:53,289
you can find our software and get up or

00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,549
goes to chain RTT that's the real time

00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,409
toolkit that's the real time stuff

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,809
people are talking about and there we

00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,820
are version 2 dot 8021 but it won't

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:02,710
integrated Ross it's part of the Oracles

00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,960
organization and that's the rtt Rose

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:08,080
integration network version 281 next

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,630
slide please so if we want to explain

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,720
Oracle's before us existed it was like

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,730
this you had these real-time components

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,190
and you could have locked free

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,559
communication between them and that

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,780
couldn't communicate with your robot and

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,760
swamp and that's running the Oracles

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,230
deployer now we were like using kst to

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,000
plot things and you know that software

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,919
crash is a lot and so on and then

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,890
something fantastic happened next slide

00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:38,380
we got Ross and that really changed our

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,090
ecosystem we could publish everything in

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,950
a real-time system to topics we could

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,260
monitor it using arvest we could use

00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,330
actually dynamic reconfigure to several

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,270
parameters those really nice thing to do

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,950
we use Ross launch rvs and so on and

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,620
absolutely the nice thing there is that

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,440
we only had to do this by loading a row

00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,720
service and the introspection is really

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,059
not disturbing a real time oh it's

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,970
already three minutes I don't ya next

00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:05,740
slides okay so people ask us what do you

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,690
think about Ross 20 we think it's a

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,730
great thing every happy that Ross is

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,740
really expanding it and it will also

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,530
make it for Oracle's users easier to

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,780
publish things on Ross and of course

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,720
Oracle's RT tivo remain Ross integrated

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:21,669
also it's ross total zero and the

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,620
maintainer ship so intermetallics will

00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:25,780
keep releasing the Oracles Ross

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,140
integration and swamp we depend a lot on

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,480
it and we will also reduce our because

00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,850
the site is bit dated

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:39,929
and we'll have better solutions there

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:41,669
thank you and you Peter hi everyone I'm

00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:42,780
back to Allah from intermetallics and I

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:44,730
want to show you some of the cool

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:49,549
applications we are doing with Ross and

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:51,750
Oracle's today so next slide please so

00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:53,760
Oracle's was the starting point of entry

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,410
mode Alex but clearly today I want to

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,290
intermetallics is bringing much more

00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,940
than Oracle's so some figures we started

00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:03,059
our commercial activities in Belgium in

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:04,559
2012 and we over the last couple of

00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:08,820
months we double the size of the company

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,799
and we are also hiring not 30 people but

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,110
we have multiple positions and it will

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,830
also like to point out that we are not

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:18,840
backed up by any investors which means

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:22,669
which means that we can control our own

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,669
strategy and we enjoy that every day

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:32,400
next slide please so I think we all know

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,950
that robotics today is a very

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,140
interdisciplinary field and so we have

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,660
different expertise in our company in

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,490
motion planning 3d vision 3d navigation

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,230
and real-time control and let's have a

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:46,230
look at what we do with these expertise

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,120
so these are just some of the references

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,040
where we can talk about so we are

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,559
supporting NASA in their efforts to

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,260
control the robo note as well as doing

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,000
their satellite docking with Oracle's we

00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,760
brought Ross and Oracle's into the ether

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,580
project which is a global effort to make

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,799
a fusion reactor in France we are

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:07,230
working with a project tango team to get

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,230
3d navigation and 3d reconstruction into

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,960
tablets and smartphones in less than two

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,790
years and we were also did a great

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,220
project for Peter foo which is a team

00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:20,400
park in France we made all the software

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,590
that controls a swarm of robots which

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,530
fly fully autonomously from takeoff to

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:27,900
landing and they are holding these

00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,570
candles and puppets and ghosts and so

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,610
it's for a night show and it's a very

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,380
spectacular sight and so sometimes

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,960
people wonder how can you do this with

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:39,360
such a small company and all these very

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,090
different markets active is that

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,830
efficiently well the answer is Ross I'm

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,370
sure that intermetallics I think it's

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,890
fair to say

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,150
would not exist without Ross so we

00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:52,260
really want to thank the community for

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:54,210
that next slide please and so we have

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,360
one more thing apart from more

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,680
project-based work we also have our

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,870
fixed price product which is called

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,050
picket and pick it is a 3d vision

00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:07,860
solution that helps you to localize

00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:10,559
object in bins on pallets and on

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,140
conveyor belts and so it comes with the

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,910
Ross interface so it's very easy for you

00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,190
to integrate it into your software

00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,380
projects I would like to end by saying

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:25,200
that we are here with a whole team okay

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:27,300
thank you thank you very much all right

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:39,450
we've got Geoffrey up now and Alex on

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:42,780
deck right um good afternoon I'm Jeffrey

00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,790
from University of Tokyo ok so I'm today

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,470
i would like to present you a very

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,929
interesting topic that we have initiated

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,450
in japan so as you can see here the

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:53,340
educational open platform for robocop at

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,710
home which is actually a service robot

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,040
development and this is with Ross and

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:01,380
talk about too ok so I'm our team

00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,780
participate in Robocop at home for many

00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,580
years and we found that this a few

00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,830
challenge that we will like to tackle

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,600
that's why we finish it at this project

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,740
so you can see like the motivation to

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,110
build service rubber is hot ok and high

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,640
costs manpower and development time so

00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,440
what we try to do is like we want to

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,770
target our education platform that can

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,559
pull in more people to join below 3000

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,260
USD and try to leverage Ross framework

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,480
to make things easy and also we want to

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,250
provide a basic developer forum for

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,460
everyone even non technical person

00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:38,580
because in robocop at home not just

00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:41,250
technical person but even people that

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,650
are not ankle is allowed and also is

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:47,370
invited to join and lastly for education

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:50,190
next ok so how we start off we want to

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,920
make it as low-cost as possible so that

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,810
we can have a very wide acceptance so we

00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,360
start from to the bots talk about to is

00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,100
a very good platform that we start with

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,530
and for

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,799
there we try to set a direction so that

00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:06,140
everyone can use it and everyone can top

00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:07,820
up from there and make it grow

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,890
throughout the years so these are some

00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,440
of the development that we have do so

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,240
from the original to the bot function we

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,720
try to improve you can see like a new

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,390
version up there with the elevated um

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,549
body that can actually grab something on

00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:27,740
normal people high and so on right next

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:30,260
okay so this is the outreach that so far

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,659
for a year that we have achieved you can

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,600
see lies very promising so in Japan we

00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:38,450
actually collaborate with robots top RT

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,900
cooperation and we have connected server

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,080
workshop over there you can see it's

00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:46,610
very encouraging we show Ross and also

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,039
talk about to all the non technical

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:52,820
person and they can catch up very fast

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:56,210
and also under our SG robotic society of

00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,950
japan so we host some symposium you can

00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,350
see the intelligent home robotics

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,299
challenge so there is a symposium that

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:05,030
we discuss about this metal and also we

00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:06,890
have a very light weight a competition

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:08,480
you can see like the small turbo is

00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,020
actually competing with the big guy over

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,990
there and also because we want to

00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,970
encourage more and make it more standard

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,159
so we have the demo challenge in robocop

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,559
japan open and we are going to do it an

00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:23,150
aleve and also we participate in the

00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:28,460
international RoboCup and we get number

00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:31,470
seven this year okay next okay so as

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,290
promised this is the

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:38,320
so as promised this is the open source

00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:40,480
details of our team and we are getting a

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,850
new domain and we are shipping it we try

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,170
to keep up with new documentation as

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,630
well anything you can contact me and

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:48,190
thanks for all the support and hopefully

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,340
more people can join us thank you very

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,340
much

00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:10,020
thank you next up is Alex and on deck is

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:14,400
Andres all right hello I'm Alex Henning

00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,710
and I'm from fet robotics as my only

00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,290
said we're hiring and today I'm going to

00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:22,530
talk to you about some tools for making

00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:24,270
producing high-quality lost packages so

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,910
I'm just awesome attention to some

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,520
packages we use at fetch so one of the

00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,550
packages we use is loss lint and it's a

00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,920
tool that will check your code and call

00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,260
out areas where you don't follow the

00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,300
style guide and were you making likely

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:44,340
making mistakes so that you are not

00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:46,170
doing as well as you can and it will

00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,790
check your Python files against the pep

00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:52,200
eight standard and it will check your

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:54,380
C++ files against the cpu using CPP

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,600
length which is the modified version for

00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,770
the Google style guide and you can

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,780
integrate it with your editor like

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:04,650
sublime or emacs so that it will give

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:06,900
you actual real time feedback as you're

00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:10,140
typing when you make a mistake the other

00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,170
tool is catkin link and it will check

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,880
yeah a package XML and you see make

00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,970
lists just like lost then we'll check

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,760
Python C++ and it will call out common

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,590
mistakes that you make and give you as

00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,890
in warnings where you're violating you

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:28,890
should do and next slide and on top of

00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:31,020
that there's a fetch tool package that

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,720
has the utilities including fetch line

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:37,170
which will one catkin rosslyn so that

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,330
you can check a package and get a high a

00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,030
quick overview of where you're violating

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:44,220
things and really drive up the code

00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,840
quality so we've been using these tools

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,210
at fetch and we found them very helpful

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,100
and if you're developing lost packages

00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,560
that worth looking at just to make sure

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,490
you following the style guide and have

00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,490
high-quality packages

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:02,350
thank you

00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:10,380
and I'm guessing you get them from those

00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:13,680
addresses by the way you forgot your

00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:22,230
robot next up is so andreas is coming up

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:29,450
and on deck is shoe 08 Alex I only have

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:29,450
one do we have a dress andreas

00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:52,110
so I promised some general purpose tools

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:55,140
beyond surgical robotics yesterday and

00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:57,270
this is one I want to present so it's

00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,160
called Arnie its advanced Ross Network

00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,680
introspection also monitoring in

00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,640
automated countermeasures next slide

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,560
please so Ross is great also for its

00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,240
introspection capabilities however they

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,250
do not scale if you have a really large

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,470
Ross setup so if you have like 50

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:16,010
machines in your lab or running on all

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:18,840
cores and saturating 10 Gigabit Ethernet

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:22,679
you might run into a bottleneck if you

00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:24,600
want to get an overview by subscribing

00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,669
to all Ross topics on a central machine

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,910
so what you can do however next slide

00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:31,950
please is that you'd essentially acquire

00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:34,169
all the metadata about all the

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:38,010
connections going on in Euros Network

00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:40,679
next slide please so since indigo you

00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,410
can set the parameter on the server and

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,660
then each subscribe automatically

00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:48,150
publishes to the slash statistics topic

00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,840
some meta information about the

00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:53,400
connections traffic frequency of packets

00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,140
and so on and so forth and they can be

00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,000
aggregated on the topics next slide

00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:00,030
please and we extended these

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,610
capabilities for providing host-based

00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,040
and note based statistics you have to

00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,380
run one specific note on each host of

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,970
your Ross set up and that will provide

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,450
you with all these additional metadata

00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:15,570
next slide please all these data get

00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:17,790
aggregated because it's only a small

00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,680
amount of data so in our whole lab setup

00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:22,410
it's like hundred kilobits per second

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,260
that's not a lot if you can compare it

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,690
to your use data like that is gigabits

00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,480
per second and all of this aggregated

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:32,910
data is rated by our processing node and

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,190
you can specify what should be the case

00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,410
on which topic should be with which

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:41,420
frequency and which bandwidth what

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:44,850
amount of data at least or at most and

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,370
all this data is specified over a

00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,290
modular configuration that gets uploaded

00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,390
to the parameter server and you can have

00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,310
our forgan all configurations for

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,530
example one for you control one for your

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:57,300
senses thick and this is not in fear

00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,040
with the runtime flexibility of ross

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,210
next slide please and

00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,590
on top of that we have the

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,660
countermeasure notes where you can use

00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:06,850
the rate at data which tells you for

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,770
example Oh on this topic the frequency

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,320
of messages has fallen below this

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,090
threshold you specified and then you

00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,550
might want to restart the note or

00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:19,500
emergency stop the robot and you can do

00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:21,400
that also with orthogonal e specifiable

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,960
configuration that gets uploaded to the

00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,240
parameter server next slide please and

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,520
then what you can use out of the box

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,400
without starting any additional notes if

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,350
you're running Ross be on indigo a GUI

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,810
which gives you this central overview of

00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:37,990
all your notes however sorry all your

00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:40,240
hosts notes topics and connections going

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,370
on in Euros network in one central our

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,860
QT plug-in together with some nice

00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:47,140
historical plots about the data next

00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,240
slide please and with that I thank you

00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,430
very much it's documented more or less

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,230
well in the ross wiki and i'm happy to

00:36:51,430 --> 00:37:00,250
answer all additional questions thank

00:36:53,230 --> 00:37:14,460
you thank you we've got show up next and

00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:17,710
robert on deck okay well hello everyone

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,680
is my honor to be here to introduce our

00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:23,710
a new product from TGI how many of you

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,860
have heard about DJ I before well quite

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,720
a lot thanks a lot thanks a lot

00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:31,450
initially initially we're making ready

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,430
to fly machines for normal customers who

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,040
want to do aerial photography and the

00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:38,980
starting with this year we make this new

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,410
platform called matrix 100 it is a

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,630
special research tool for developers and

00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:46,240
the researchers the feature of this

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,330
platform is it has the onboard API for

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,730
people to send control command to the

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,980
flag controller directly and it has an

00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,020
extendable frame that you can mount your

00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,380
only equipments are the way as we shown

00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,930
here ramond a small onboard embedded

00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,700
computer and we mount set of sensors so

00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,520
that you can send in your control

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:09,010
command from this small computer so this

00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:13,090
whole system can work fully autonomously

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:13,700
and the next slide please since we are

00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,710
we

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,760
want to make the system more integrated

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:23,140
so we developed our own version called a

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:26,000
manifold this is a nvidia TK 1 based

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,130
embedded computer it has a close

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,170
connection with our flag controller it

00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:32,600
has building hardware connectors that

00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:35,960
allows you to directly cannot to our

00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:38,000
flight controller and it has the ability

00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,610
to read our King both stabilize the

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
camera from the system this photo is

00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:46,400
taken during the iris exhibition several

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,040
days ago while showing that we can use

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,770
our platform to read the camera image

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,500
from the camera and the displaced as a

00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,570
conventional linux machine and you can

00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,310
use opencv to process the image and

00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:02,150
around your computer vision algorithms

00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:05,450
and our system is build on Ross you can

00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:08,540
have your Ross program to talk with our

00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:12,220
flag controller where our Ross package

00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:15,080
next slide please and there's already

00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:18,080
several researchers starting to use our

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,930
system to do research this video shown

00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,810
here is a professor who using our

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:26,890
platform to too aggressive movement

00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:29,030
control in gps denied environment

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,610
basically the student from this

00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:33,500
professor using a one-week to understand

00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:36,110
our system and i start to know how to

00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,660
control and they use another way to put

00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:40,220
their algorithms onto our platform and

00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,620
they use several weeks to write this

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:46,220
paper and it will be published soon i

00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:48,260
think so we basically what we're

00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,530
providing here we're providing a set of

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,440
comprehensive programmable platform to

00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:57,290
allows you to use ross to talk to a flag

00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,540
controller and the whole system have

00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,550
open source the protocol and the

00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,620
document all online on the github and

00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,960
there's a total price of this set of

00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:09,020
system is within five thousand US dollar

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,320
and you can get more information by

00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,720
visiting our website DVD drive calm and

00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,210
if you want to talk more in person i

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,660
will stay around for some time and i

00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:22,049
will fly the drone about my house

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,049
miss me

00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:33,390
thanks a lot all right for a last

00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,390
lightning talk we've got robbed Robert

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,520
thank you hello everybody my name is

00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,290
Robert hustla I'm a research fellow at

00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:54,300
the Austrian Institute of Technology

00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:59,080
it's the largest extramural research

00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:01,900
institute in Austria next slide please I

00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,390
will give you a short peak in our

00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,980
research in the area of autonomous land

00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:11,380
vehicles we are developing a system a

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,680
modular and scalable system for with

00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:18,850
weight room fitting highly specialized

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:26,700
vehicles just like vehicles only

00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:31,390
existing several times on world and we

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:33,580
developed a mapping system where we do

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:35,920
the sensor fusion so it's it's

00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:39,580
unimportant which kind of sensors you

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,730
use we have basically we have a stereo

00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:46,390
camera system a laser system and fused

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:49,090
all the data into three and three and a

00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:52,780
half D representation of the world of

00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:54,460
the environment of the robot the the map

00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:59,740
consists of accessibility to map a

00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:02,080
height map and occupants in map then the

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,090
maps are stored in a kiss fashion for

00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,000
you it's Orton tires and it can be

00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,860
loaded of in offer it can be loaded from

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,220
our key system and overlaid with

00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,140
satellite maps and viewed with Google

00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,450
Maps or something like that something

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,210
like that in this in this cost maps in

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:25,450
his excessive accessibility maps we used

00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:29,740
when pl2 to generate a local trajectory

00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:30,820
after of the track to avoid obstacles

00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,180
and

00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:39,330
to drive along and GPS have redefined in

00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:42,610
front of the mission in the energies to

00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,710
next like this so these are my
