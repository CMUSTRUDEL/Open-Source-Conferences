okay so hello everyone my name is Gary

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:12,809
I'm from paraguay in south america and i

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,219
work for the ecumene it's a compound an

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,379
argentinian company with software

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:21,119
development with Ross we specialize in

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:24,119
rows on Android and Ross on the web this

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,980
photo of our team and these are some of

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,560
our clients so I want to start

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,820
mentioning that this project was brought

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:42,000
was funded by welcome managed by OS RF

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:46,590
and implemented by by by we yes so a few

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,399
definitions before we start that will be

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,719
useful during that the talk we use it

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,620
the Java native interface we also use

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:04,610
heavily of the Android NDK and we also

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:08,580
have some parts of Ross Java so what's

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,619
Android Ross Andre indicate have you how

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,760
many of you have heard about have read

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:18,330
about Ross and windy k awesome thank you

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,369
so Ross under 80k is basically a set of

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,409
libraries as a sorry a set of scripts

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:28,740
that helps us build course compile ros1

00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:32,220
packages and libraries using their day

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:36,060
Android NDK these are loathe this allows

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,810
us to run roast packages or libraries as

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,960
a native activities we we can use a

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,290
normal Android app using the g ni en

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,579
Rose Java or we can use as native

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:53,759
executable so what had been done we

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,180
basically cross-compile 181 ross

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,899
packages from the desktop variant we

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,820
didn't we didn't cross compile the

00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:05,460
visualization stuff or python

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:09,000
dependencies Oh packages that have

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,900
Python dependencies we create a set of

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,819
tutorials so people can get started with

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,370
using the

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:22,819
sandrine DK there is a tutorial for

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:24,739
creating native activities we have I we

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,230
have the the tutorials are I don't know

00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:30,139
if they are online yet but for using the

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,750
DNI rappers with Ross java and we have a

00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:37,480
road localization demo that will we will

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:43,760
be showing on the qualcomm booth next it

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:47,329
later so why we think android devices

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:51,799
are becoming really you be curious and

00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:56,930
very popular so unreal devices are also

00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:59,199
becoming very very very powerful so

00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,790
there are applications that we can use

00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,989
we can we can start using android

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,639
devices on a robot android devices are

00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:12,409
also becoming very cheaper very cheap

00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:15,230
and we can do we can program robots with

00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:19,879
android and do a nandroid an android app

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,790
but we want to use rose right so why not

00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:30,079
use rose java that's a comic i really

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:32,989
like about the standards so Ross java

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:36,620
assignment as essential on the previous

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,209
slide is a native app implementation in

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,449
Java for Ross libraries Rose

00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,400
communications but we don't have all the

00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:45,409
power all the power of roles of the

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,109
libraries navigation stuff so we if we

00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:50,900
want to use raw java app university lab

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:57,109
we need to implement all the

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:59,419
functionalities so Ross and Randi Kaye

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:06,079
can still be used with Rossi Ava's I

00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:08,479
mentioned previously also and we can run

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,099
Ross notes native directly we can real

00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,829
smooth base or whatever know we want

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:18,799
directly without the need of

00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:19,980
implementing anything so we have some

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,630
some

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:27,390
stuff to work on we this is already done

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:30,120
but yeah a better way to generate and

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:34,140
update the Rose packages because this

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,600
was a very manual effort to we have a

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,990
rose in style and we have to manually

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,850
update the four new versions and tough

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:47,070
and make make sure we don't have we have

00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:51,090
the correct packages there is one issue

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,310
we're having right now that we we need

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,900
to manually adjust the order of the

00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:01,140
libraries in order to to build the final

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:05,040
library this is Ben this is being worked

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:08,880
on and it's almost finished we are also

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,070
working on Rosie are rappers and in

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,910
creating tutorials so people can start

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:19,020
using them we have a big issue with Ross

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:22,590
back because Ross Ross back uses Python

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:27,510
and also the file system structure is

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:30,030
different in online bread so we we are

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,090
starting to work on that we also have

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,690
issues with plugin live basically for

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,760
the same reason but we have a workaround

00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,460
for that day's using hard-coded plugins

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,860
for some power our move base there more

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,280
uses hard-coded plugins there is a fork

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,740
of moog bass so we can we can build

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,560
everything we don't have action live

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,800
implemented on Java on Russia we are

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,500
also working on that we need to test the

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,480
packages because we only cross compile

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,500
everything but we haven't tested every

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,170
single package and there are a lot of

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:09,710
things that need to be tested but yeah

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:15,240
and we also starting to work on

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:17,490
supporting Ross soup I know this this

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,620
also been done with the people from OS

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:29,310
RF so how can you contribute there is a

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:31,530
github repo we were ecumene where a name

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,880
differently before last week we were

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,070
creative a 77

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,990
oh they're Zealand on the old repo we're

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:42,090
migrating that but you can go there I

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,600
forgot to add the tutorials link here

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:51,320
you can write me on my email or visit

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:55,940
our our page and well I think that's it

00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,940
thank you for your time

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,350
questions

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,420
the question is if there is any effort

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,420
to try to were to get Python on Android

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,970
we are not trying to do that and I don't

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,630
know if there is any support for that in

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,650
the community there yet there may be

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,650
somebody aware not

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,249
okay so the question is what's the use

00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:53,829
case if we are going if we want to use

00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:59,499
phones to control robot or if we want to

00:07:53,829 --> 00:08:03,309
use robots and opened yeah the use case

00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:04,749
for this is basically running the using

00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:09,129
the phone as the main computer of the

00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:12,539
robot or can be any other Android

00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:12,539
