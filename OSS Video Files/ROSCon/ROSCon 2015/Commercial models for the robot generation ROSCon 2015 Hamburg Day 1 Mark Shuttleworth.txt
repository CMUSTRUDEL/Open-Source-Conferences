	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,930
and hello everybody it is really great

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,559
to be here I studied horrible mishmash

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:13,950
of science and maths and physics and and

00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,420
IT and finance right at a time in the

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,130
late 90s when suddenly the internet was

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,039
coming to South Africa and I was really

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,439
drawn to it and you could literally

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,970
watch packets arrive at the mainframe

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,710
sort of one a second remember the old

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,289
ftp program that actually put like a

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,730
little hash each time 1500 bytes arrived

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,270
and you could sit there with wow that

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,890
came from America so but I was

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,370
fascinated both by this kind of cool

00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,350
technology learning on IP and TCP and

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,510
HTTPS and things like that but

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,000
fascinated by the interplay between that

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,620
and society right so I always think that

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,780
you know we talk about changes in

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,149
society it's easy to miss but they're

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,969
always driven by changes in technology

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,649
and it's the same with business changes

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,680
in business are almost always change

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,289
driven by changes in what's possible

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,030
which is changes in technology now I

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,850
know you guys are brilliant so I can't

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,330
teach you anything about robotics or

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,860
actuators but i hope i can share some

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,030
ideas and thoughts about how these

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,680
disruptions these incredible changes

00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,750
tear up economics and make new things

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,490
possible all Schumpeter's creative

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,580
destruction how that works and how to

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,170
think about the the trajectory for your

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,119
thoughts and your work whether that's

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,210
social you know how you're going to

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,860
change society because the work that you

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,619
do will have real consequences right the

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,270
technical brilliance is one thing but it

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,369
will have real consequences in society

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,600
and also if you are part of the startup

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,290
or you want to be part of a start-up or

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,840
you want to be part of a

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,210
mega-corporation how to think about the

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,189
business models associated with that so

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,530
I I hope we'll play with some

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,020
interesting technology and I've had a

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,680
blast over the last week sprinting with

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,719
the guys from Allah robotics and a team

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,710
from canonical and some other community

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,079
folks looking at technology for things

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,329
like how we how we reshape the operating

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,250
system for things and the deep thought

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,250
there really is how do we how do we take

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,660
what works beautifully in the lab and

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,860
make that work beautifully in the field

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,930
right because there's a two

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,010
quite different environments so be a

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,200
bunch of stuff there I'll be down at the

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,690
command line and almost anything could

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,960
go wrong we have flaky wireless networks

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,510
from flaky software too flaky presenters

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,590
so anything could go wrong and hold your

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:35,660
breath so I am inspired by being around

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,010
people who are both creative and

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,340
rigorous you know that intersection of

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,400
science physics rigor and art is amazing

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,840
and I think what you guys are doing is

00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,250
exactly that right it's the intersection

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,290
of art and science so I only have one

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,550
sort of piece of businesses my advice

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,260
for anybody especially people who want

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,260
to be entrepreneurs it's this never

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,780
chase headlines and never chase

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,510
ambulances right chasing ambulances is a

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,550
is a sort of smear against lawyers in

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,989
america who make money out of other

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,130
people's misfortune and it's just a

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,570
terrible way to be so you don't do

00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,130
anything that makes money out of other

00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,709
people's misfortune but chasing

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,810
headlines is interesting and we're never

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,370
never to do you know i often hear like

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,660
you know whats app gets bought for 19

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,280
billion dollars and then i get like this

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,610
stream of proposals and the people

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,680
saying we want to be the next whats app

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,670
you can never chase headlines right it

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,590
takes five to ten years to make an

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,700
overnight success and I've seen this

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,310
every time you know the internet

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,230
exploded and people would say jeez that

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,640
internet you know like last year it

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,900
wasn't around and suddenly everybody's

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,790
got an email address and I was like yep

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,489
those have been around for 20 years it

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,560
just does that right there's this long

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,540
period of stuff being cool and then

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,580
suddenly the stuff is everywhere and if

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,540
you're not involved in something you

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,340
know it feels like it just happened

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,330
overnight and if you are involved in

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,489
something it just feels like it's going

00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,680
to go on forever but I guarantee you in

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:04,200
this room is the next angry birds or the

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,299
next break out of something if you want

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,280
to be part of that promise you someone

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,810
in this room is going to do it that it

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,019
just feels kind of cranky for a long

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,790
time before it breaks out and but that

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,229
means that you have to be thinking five

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,090
to ten years in advance you have to be

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:24,330
thinking about the changes in what's

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:26,370
possible disruption in a sense is much

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,430
easier than it looks you know there's

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,410
this great store

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,930
about a flea in a jar you put a flea in

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,270
a jar I've never tried this seems cruel

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,280
to fleas if you put a flea in a jar with

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,440
a lid on it and flee will jump and jump

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,229
and jump and hit his head on the lid and

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,940
eventually just learn not to jump that

00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:44,470
high then you take the little from the

00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,360
flea will never get out of the jar right

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,789
because it won't jump off and in a sense

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,440
businesses I like that right stuffs not

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,550
possible they try it they fail they try

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,020
it they fail and so they stop trying

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,130
right and all disruption is is that the

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,800
narrative the thread of technology

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,690
changes what's possible and traditional

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,180
big established businesses often won't

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,410
try and jump out of their jar right but

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,210
if you're really interested in jumping

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,800
right you'll find a way and you if you

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,410
can find something to land on on the

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,820
other side you've disrupted so really

00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,130
it's just thinking about changes in

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,560
what's possible right it's pretty easy

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,199
to predict what people want and so you

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,300
know just watch Star Trek and and and

00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,099
and then say like is that possible now

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,280
and if it is you can disrupt something

00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:28,900
really really profoundly and I've seen a

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,389
bunch of these disruptions i just turned

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,210
42 so i officially qualified for old

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,830
fart status that there's some benefits

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,150
to being an old fat and that is that

00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,360
you've seen some of these things before

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,430
right I saw the web think about if you

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,870
can remember think about all these

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,570
businesses that used to be completely

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,210
unstoppable completely in a dominant in

00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:52,870
an industry that just died between 1995

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,430
and 2005 right just because they weren't

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,220
part of that disruption or disruptions

00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,970
you know generally things are pretty

00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,190
incremental you know everything next

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,990
year is five percent more than than last

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,419
year but then you get a disruption and

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,770
on the other side of that anything can

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,659
be it's like an earthquake right there's

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,550
a bunch of buildings that just disappear

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,400
in a very short period of time and that

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:15,039
creates space for new buildings to be

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,900
built we saw that with a web very much

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,130
we saw that with mobile again a bunch of

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:25,120
web companies disappear just because

00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:27,639
they didn't catch the mobile wave I

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,620
think we'll see the same thing now with

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,300
connected devices with with bringing

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:37,180
data and intelligence to the ambient

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,740
world right everywhere around us I think

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,649
that's going to be an invisible but

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,849
profound

00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,559
disruption it's not your disruption oh

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,089
because you need another miracle the HP

00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:46,229
guys have this great expression if for

00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,990
any product you should only have one

00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:51,240
miracle right to miracles and it's a

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,339
science project but one miracle is

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,319
doable in any given product a product

00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:56,339
and so I think you guys need two

00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,990
miracles right we need to get the

00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:02,719
Internet of Things story really amazing

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:08,749
and then we make those things truly

00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:11,669
mobile dynamic and then you know AI so I

00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:13,529
think your moment is approaching I

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,449
really do and so it's a great privilege

00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:16,919
to be right here in the thick of you and

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,020
get hang out with you for the weekend

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,369
and and chat about some interesting

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:30,360
stuff right this of course this of

00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:34,289
course is a rubbish Minh a trash can

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,759
depending on your nationality um mattila

00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:39,779
astoria I was hanging out a guy called

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,559
Tim chin and tim is a lovely wonderful

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:44,759
funny guy he is you know the progeny of

00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:47,459
the progeny the progeny of one of

00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,169
taiwan's five big technology families

00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,360
you go back to the sort of 70s 80s and

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:53,610
they were these five families in taiwan

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,039
that basically set up the technology

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,159
industry so today that's like I think a

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:01,860
sous and quanta and so on but via if you

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,509
if you know via the company that's Tim

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,599
Chan's family and so I think he's second

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,659
or third generation you know CEO of this

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,649
company and he was saying mark you know

00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:13,050
you know and just as I was graduating

00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:15,089
college and so on I thought I'd done

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,369
really well because the family picked me

00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:19,949
to to run the business right the

00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:23,369
technology businesses in my my brother

00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:25,139
he went off to to make dustbins he says

00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,779
you know what I'm starting to realize he

00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,779
says do you know what the margins are on

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:32,009
Dustin's fifty percent do you know what

00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,199
I'm trying to sell nine billion

00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,849
transistors for twelve cents all right

00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:38,490
and there's something to think about

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,469
right if you if you start to think about

00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:44,039
the commercialization of your of your

00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:47,250
attitude of your of your idea margin

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,230
value will often not be in the place

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,300
that you think it's going to be right

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,280
and that's particularly true around

00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,190
hardware right if you if you if you

00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,470
think about physical things and if your

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,060
business is going to be there's a thing

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,000
right and we people going to buy the

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,640
thing the Dustin you'd be surprised at

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,140
what has great margins and what doesn't

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,350
in technology is extremely difficult to

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,120
make a product a physical product just a

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,130
physical product with very high margins

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,050
extremely difficult just because the

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,110
manufacturing processes are competitive

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,580
and many of you will in fact be so far

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,430
from the manufacturing process that's

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,140
really hard to get that right and so I

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,720
would I would caution you if you're

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,790
going to get into physical things if

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,260
that's your thinking and to really think

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,480
about who the buyer is going to be

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,010
there's this great analysis of margins

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,140
on different cars depending on whether

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:42,730
the buyer of the car is is the husband

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,430
or the wife and believe it or not that

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:51,640
makes a difference to the margin on the

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:54,580
car and there are cases of course where

00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,360
you you're able to create margins on on

00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,860
on hardware but ultimately I think if

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,000
you focus on Hardware you're at risk

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,190
pure heart rate you're at risk of

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,040
creating landfill right like you're just

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,510
feeding this this consumer thing where

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,550
we make stuff and then throw it away

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:14,470
because hardware on its own I think is

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:17,590
is becoming disposable so how do you go

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,870
beyond that well obviously software and

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,730
the great example of this I think you

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,320
know the classic example of this is

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:28,420
cisco right the metal in the tin you can

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,520
buy exactly the same metal in the tin

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:33,340
from another manufacturer that other

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,700
manufacturer will make five to ten

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,430
percent profit on the metal on the chips

00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:45,490
and the box what do you think Cisco's

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:48,010
margins are on a cisco switch sixty-five

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,600
percent and the reason for that is

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,860
straightforward it's cisco works better

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,000
with cisco so if you bought a bunch of

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,010
cisco then you're going to go buy more

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,260
cisco right so that's the classic kind

00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,220
of razors and blade strategy right that

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:02,380
that if you can get people to to need

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,130
things that work well together and need

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,440
guarantees or

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,030
bath in that drives up margins I don't

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,620
think it's a great business while is

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,030
getting very difficult because of open

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,160
standards which I think you're exactly

00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,720
right right so we're learning that we

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,800
want to make open standards you want to

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,600
be able to buy parts from different

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,000
people and plug them in have them work

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,150
so I think you know Cisco is a classic

00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,160
example but it's it's it's a bit of a

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:27,610
historical one a more interesting

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,460
approach is to say well let's take the

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,470
hardware and add software to create an

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:36,910
ecosystem right the classic examples

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,740
there would be app stores and so that's

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,210
a fairly straightforward way to say how

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,160
do i how do i take piece of hardware i

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,810
know i'm not going to make much margin

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,420
on that but what I really want is I want

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,400
to attract people to create around that

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,990
and I like that I like that a lot more

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,540
as a sort of modern business model

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,090
obviously because it's it's it builds on

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,650
open standards right it uses the way

00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:01,960
things are moving in a very creative way

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:03,250
and so and I I brought along a guest to

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,720
show you a taste of what that might look

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:16,360
like in the age of robotics and so this

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:23,550
is the Birla spider and that is a robot

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,550
running roz with an app store and she

00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,390
she wants to do your bidding so this

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,880
let's let's have a look and at this

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,310
robot now I'm talking about app stores

00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,930
now that the tricky thing with app

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,140
stores of course is that you you're

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,090
adding and removing software to a live

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,030
device and if you think about what you

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:55,690
do in the labs and the way you work with

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:59,890
software and the experience of that you

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,730
know apt-get install yum install and the

00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,670
expertise required for that it would be

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,220
challenging to imagine end-users saying

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,960
oh I just can't wait to act get dissed

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,250
upgrade and my thing of one form or

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,340
another so we

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,900
spend a lot of time working with people

00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,520
who were doing stuff in slab and

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,860
starting to stress about what this thing

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,440
was going to feel like when it was in

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,250
the field we realized that to get there

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,720
we were going to have to essentially

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,410
tear up the rule-bot rulebook and

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,150
basically jump out of the jar out of our

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,430
own jar because people say you know

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,620
what's great about Ubuntu or any Linux

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,960
distributions I can just get anything

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,760
right I get up get the world and that's

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,310
cool or I can go to github and build

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,230
stuff right and that's cool too and so

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,970
we celebrate those things but in order

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,400
to get out of the lab and into the field

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,350
we can have to basically completely tear

00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,170
that up because those tools building

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,880
from source on the device or app gate

00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,950
and the package configure and so on on

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,290
the device are just not going to go from

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,690
the lab to a billion devices in the

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,980
field right so we've got hacker we

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:11,140
completely recraft ubuntu to meet that

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,340
test and the cool thing is there's a

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,650
whole bunch of new technology in the

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,270
kernel that we lead around containers

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,270
and there's a bunch of new ways of

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,400
thinking about security cryptography and

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,550
the ascend the validation of software

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,080
and what we did is we took all the same

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,790
libraries that make up ubuntu and we

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,370
said let's recraft them in this new way

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,770
and that's open to core and the first

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,690
thing you'll notice about them to call

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:36,690
is that nothing works

00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:52,769
and I should be SS aged into her wakey

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,769
wakey

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,139
you wouldn't believe the chain of

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:10,209
carrier pigeon smoke signals that are

00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:12,190
connecting this laptop to her so um app

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,440
get doesn't work and why does that get

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,300
not work because we've essentially

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,019
changed the packaging system so that we

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,240
can guarantee updates and removes with

00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:25,540
no configuration we can guarantee the

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,850
complete isolation of one application

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,440
from another application from the

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,959
operating system and that means that any

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,959
individual player you or someone who's

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:38,079
making an app for you or canonical who's

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,480
updating a bun to we can each go as fast

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,730
as we want to go without having to

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,149
negotiate about anything right so

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,920
there's no interlock so snappy it is

00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,750
right snappy list let's see watching

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,480
what's installed here and what you'll

00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:57,610
see is a can you read then you'll see a

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,490
list of new style packages we call them

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,139
snaps and obviously there's a bunch of

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,490
cool that's the operating system paste

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,769
Bennett you can see someone's been

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,709
trying to cut and paste stuff from from

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:12,790
this lady say tweet the spider web DM

00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:15,940
pi/2 that's all kind of cool let me show

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:22,209
so can you make her go forward and back

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:26,130
just we can check that she works so we

00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:26,130
have this is Victor Victor

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:36,530
I very glamorous assistant and so that's

00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:41,160
there we go she's awake all right and

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:45,900
all that's being controlled by is a

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:47,400
tweet the spyder victor tweet the spider

00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,040
is this is the snap that's the brain

00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,540
right ok so it's called tweet the spider

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:55,200
of a reason because there's a magic

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,050
tweet that allows you to make a go

00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,970
forward or backwards and victor is going

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,890
to keep her on the table so this is

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,210
going to be a fun exercise decided not

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,560
to tell you what the magic tweet for

00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,170
turn left or turn right was because we

00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:13,620
don't have many options in in this

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:15,600
regard um right so she's a live running

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,040
robot and without turning her off I want

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:25,490
to update the software so let's have a

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:25,490
look here hmm

00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,840
I don't know how many countries these

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,460
packets are going through how many

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:44,140
intelligence agencies are scratching

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:45,400
their heads ah so she's normally what

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,960
she does does she just looks at a local

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,550
package cash because I asked for updates

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,760
she's going out to the store to say and

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:57,700
is there anything new for me is there

00:17:51,760 --> 00:18:00,880
anything new for you while we're doing

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,830
that so the idea is to take your device

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,230
and open it up open it up to other

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,660
people's magic other people's innovation

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:09,610
right the ideas of them the more people

00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,559
you know the benefits of collaboration

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,530
around your own code imagine you could

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:16,030
get this kind of collaboration around

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,080
your device but even better imagine you

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,660
could get this kind of collaboration

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,270
around rods right so that they could be

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,309
rods apps written four runs robots

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,200
without actually having to make the rods

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:29,410
robots right we see every time we

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,960
decouple the device from the software

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,270
from the creativity we get this

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,050
explosion in ecosystems and so you get

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,429
an an app store type ecosystem format

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,170
creating ok so it looks like there's an

00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,090
update that say application over there

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:47,410
has an update so while that's quite

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,179
a big update so while she's yeah while

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:54,910
she's working let's just do that update

00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:57,660
I didn't expect SSH to be the tricky

00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,660
part of this dimmer

00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:11,559
it might be the Wi-Fi or someone said

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:12,880
yeah but we'll take our chances anyway

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,220
so what I want to do is just do a live

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,380
upgrade so I have complete confidence in

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,140
the system because it's put together

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:21,610
that I can just do an update and it will

00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,020
come and it's not going to affect the

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,159
operation the robot right and the reason

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,840
we're going to take the operations of

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:29,919
the robot is because the way we've

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,270
pulled everything apart right so these

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,620
apps can be updated completely

00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,559
independent each other they cannot write

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,419
to each other's files so then this app

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,370
can't break this up there's no way it

00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:42,640
can get there there's no chance of that

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,659
happening so that's what we have to do

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,860
part of what we had to do in the

00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:48,279
operating system the other thing we

00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:50,230
found is talking to people is the folks

00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,909
are saying look I've got the world of

00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,500
source code at my fingertips but I've

00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:54,549
also got a world of pain every time I

00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,750
try and build it I've got to track all

00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,950
these different versions I've got to

00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,539
organize it or go to understand all

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,490
these different software projects build

00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:03,520
systems every different kind of major

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,990
body of content has its own build system

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,140
Rose has captain captain the nodejs guys

00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,320
of NPM the Ruby guys have you know gems

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,149
python guys have pie pie their auto

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,370
tools project make project see make

00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:19,659
projects conda's project you know I have

00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,070
to become an expert in all of those

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:23,500
things effectively to be able to

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,490
assemble software and of course we've

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,470
never really thought about that because

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,690
app get is so great but it's only great

00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,010
if the software that you need is already

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:32,260
packaged right and it turns out that

00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,360
when you're going as fast as robotics is

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,539
going it's all source code right it's on

00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:41,409
github or it's on a variety of different

00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:42,630
places so let's go in and and have a

00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:45,820
look over here so i want to show you

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:48,360
that that build happened let me clean it

00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,929
well i'm not sure about the Wi-Fi now

00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,929
well why not

00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,370
so we looked at what people were doing

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,890
and essentially what people doing is

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,320
following recipes right so Roz has it

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,510
set of recipes this in spite you know

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,620
catkin effectively and every different

00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,730
source code project out there has

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,800
different build systems different

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,100
approaches we didn't want to build a new

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,540
build system right that should get a

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,310
round of applause because that there's a

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:21,620
lot of them what we wanted to do was a

00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,180
what we want to build was a meta build

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,240
system right we wanted to say look I

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,070
should be able to describe a project

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,050
right and say that uses this build

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,430
system build it right I just want to

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,260
grab that thing over there that users

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,640
make I want to grab that thing over

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,260
there from Roz I'm going to grab this

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,570
thing over here which uses scones I'm

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,100
going to grab something else very high

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,500
level and then it should just do what it

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:47,000
needs to do right and that turned out to

00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:51,520
be really quite fun so here is my

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,080
personal project m which is this and

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,370
which if I'm stopped at US Customs I'm

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,360
going to have to describe as half a

00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:02,240
precision guided missile it is it is in

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:06,170
fact or half a bomb because it's a clock

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:11,360
so it's a raspberry pi yeah you know

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:13,220
that story five amazing so so it's a

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120
raspberry pi with a GPS hat on it and

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,830
and what I'm making is a I'm basically

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,260
just combine combining two pieces of

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:25,490
software free software gpsd from eric

00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:27,650
raymond and the ntp and so i let me just

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,990
make that front work a bit better you

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,520
see that so all I'm doing is I'm

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,720
basically saying I've got a project out

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:39,350
there gpsd well this is a project time

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:42,560
sink haha and which is a made of two

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:46,400
part and the one part is gpsd which is a

00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,560
scones project yeah and here's the

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,050
source and what that source is a tarball

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,420
and these are packages you should have

00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,880
installed before you build that thing

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,830
and then this one over here is ntp which

00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,980
uses auto tools and there's the source

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:06,620
there I didn't mean to click on that and

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:08,090
so if I just say a snap craft build it

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,320
goes and fetches the source it installs

00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,730
all the packages it has every

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,049
so the idea is to create is really

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:14,149
lightweight descriptions which can be

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:16,940
shared really quickly of useful stuff

00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:19,370
out there that's before packaging BP

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,259
right before it shows up in app get and

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,000
people can pass those things around is

00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,950
like five lines of yeah more and you

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,840
will have gpsd in your project right

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,210
it'll build everything in a project tree

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,309
put it there so that you can you can use

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,309
it for for your brain and that will go

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:38,960
often do its thing here's another little

00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:41,509
project and this one is a rose project

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,610
so this is going to use a catkin plugin

00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:45,139
right so this is a plug-in for snap

00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,960
craft that understands catkin and how

00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:49,399
catkin behaves and all i have to do is

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,870
say look I want these catkin packages

00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:52,879
and then these packages other packages

00:23:50,870 --> 00:24:01,100
have to be installed beforehand so let's

00:23:52,879 --> 00:24:02,929
go build that right so I'm running these

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,269
two independent bills in different trees

00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:07,820
and literally all I would do is just get

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:09,169
clone a tree and snap craft and it

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,460
doesn't matter what that's pulling in

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:11,720
right if it's pulling in make stuff if

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,059
that's pulling in real stuff that's

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,950
putting something else it is it's a meta

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,570
build system right so just have to have

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,669
just just to describe what's out there

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,110
and pull it all together and build it

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,629
and it'll fetch its own set of packages

00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,690
get everything Oh get everything in

00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,690
place

00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:45,080
thanks for the veto software guys right

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:49,940
so that's all cool here is the here is

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:52,730
the Rose catkin sorry captain Rose snap

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,379
craft description that built this brain

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,899
last night there's no way and how long

00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:58,309
are the build up this morning mmm but

00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:00,409
that's the description essentially to

00:24:58,309 --> 00:25:01,820
build a rose package right and so you

00:25:00,409 --> 00:25:03,590
can say i want all the stuff and Rose I

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,970
want that is one part then I want to GPS

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,529
di want that is another part and grew

00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,929
and when you're done you'll have all of

00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:14,269
that code built in a single tree ready

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:17,090
to go ready to stick on your spider okay

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:23,899
so there is some software how's the

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:26,899
network can do okay there is some

00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:29,090
software and in that brain which is

00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:31,669
listening to Twitter and so we're going

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,250
to we're going to use her to do to test

00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,139
some polls to get a sense of your guys

00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,860
feeling on some important topics in

00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:41,899
robotics and and so the first of those

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:44,539
topics is which is going to come to

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,830
consumer first autonomous driving get in

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:48,620
the car no driving or figure or

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:51,440
autonomous fly and so if you wouldn't

00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,070
mind if you could make her go forwards

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,799
or backwards depending on your views on

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,299
that issue and we have a nice we have a

00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,759
nice exercise here where we can really

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:04,879
easily see what you think just which way

00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:11,000
is forwards forwards this way okay so

00:26:04,879 --> 00:26:13,410
forwards to Victor let's see if we can

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,550
get her going

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:19,290
right so I talk about software as a way

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,310
to basically transform some hardware

00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,530
into something much more interesting

00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:25,340
something much more valuable something

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,150
that you can build ecosystems around and

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:31,160
some of the stuff we're doing to make

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,160
that really easy right in terms of oh

00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:42,150
that's that's going to be fun just to

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:43,290
remind you so one of the key things

00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,880
about software is that you're shifting

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:45,710
the relationship with people towards

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,910
paying for what they're actually

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,290
interested in right and you're creating

00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,700
more things that they can be interested

00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:52,500
in and environmentally I think there's a

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,660
beautiful story about software which is

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,210
that it makes hardware useful for longer

00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,440
right I don't like filling up landfills

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,090
so one of the beautiful things about

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,820
software is that something has many more

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,280
uses it tentative used for much longer

00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:09,360
it can be updated it gets more

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:13,650
interesting we keep I think we've

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,880
answered that question we keep and we

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,980
keep the hardware for longer because we

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,840
can make it more useful through software

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:23,490
um but there's a way to go even further

00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,210
or it's a battle there's where to go

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:29,070
even further right and and that is to

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,640
shift towards services right and

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:34,830
services really align your interests

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,720
with those of your users all right so

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,190
what I mean by services I mean forget

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,160
the software make the software free

00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:44,070
right but then essentially engage with

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,840
people on a daily basis and this is

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,700
really where the world you know is is

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,450
headed because if you can essentially

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,810
offer value to people every day and

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,810
there's a whole

00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:06,540
someone was going to figure it out

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:10,050
you're so twisted right so the thing

00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:14,360
about services is the thing about

00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:17,910
services is for you to be making money

00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,780
your customer has to be continuing to

00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,950
love and use the device right and that's

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,710
really important I think it's really

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,210
healthy for both parts but it also means

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,280
that you have a real interest in how

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,470
that thing behaves in the field right a

00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,960
key part about services businesses the

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,940
economics every month you'll be spending

00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,830
money essentially to service everything

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,380
that's out there every month you'll be

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,630
earning money right based on delivering

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,160
value to those things and those two

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,770
halves have to balance out otherwise

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,620
things get ugly quickly but the cool

00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,510
thing about that is so what that means

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,800
is you want to be able to server

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,560
something remotely I mean there's

00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,030
probably a Wi-Fi base station up top

00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,070
here behind there right it's really

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,080
expensive to go and fix that manually

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,790
the tacos talk about rolling a truck

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,200
cost them a fortune to roll a truck

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,970
right if they've got a device somewhere

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,950
in somebody's premises that's broken and

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,840
I have to roll a truck that's really

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,570
expensive it'll completely kill your

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,670
business so that's why we've that's why

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,320
we've what's that yeah that over there

00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,810
you need a ladder and a guy with a

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,340
health ins with the Hivers vest to

00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:25,050
change that right and high-vis vest a

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:27,750
very expensive so you really want to

00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,950
care about how field serviceable that is

00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,960
that's why we put so much effort into

00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,910
that transactional update and roll back

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,480
and that's this is what that looks like

00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:37,980
the one to call the snappy approach so

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,990
in a traditional operating system right

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,660
you've got a big file system and root

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,400
can write anywhere right so when you

00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,170
install packages your running stuff as

00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,940
root and those packages can sort of go

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,230
everywhere right so it's all the first

00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,210
package and it's wonderful to install

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,620
the second package things are great but

00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,080
then you start to install packages that

00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,360
need to share files and of course now

00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,430
you create a burden on the user to

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,090
administer and mediate those choices and

00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:04,500
fix them if something changes right so

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:06,460
what do we do is snappy we said okay

00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:10,180
let's pull apart all of

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:14,620
those pieces let's put all the code into

00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,760
signed binary blobs so that they can't

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,340
be tampered with right you'll know

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,440
immediately if someone's messing with

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:23,860
the software and we give each of those

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,660
binary pieces their own spaces to write

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,330
stuff like configuration or data and

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:31,000
things like that and we use the colonel

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,710
containment mechanisms right the same

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,040
stuff that we built that docker builds

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,770
on to to essentially keep those pieces

00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,740
apart right and so snaps each of these

00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,900
these big dark pieces that's a snap and

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,670
you can have there's an OS snap that we

00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,710
make and you can have apps snaps that

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:50,590
you make and those each get their own

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,210
writable space they can't pollute each

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:57,280
other's space right so you get these

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:59,590
writable spaces okay so the next big

00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,850
question profound question in robotics

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:11,160
have we flushed the cue the next big

00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:11,160
question is are we going anthropomorphic

00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:18,010
go go go r2d2 and so are we are we going

00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,840
anthropomorphic or are we going

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,090
functional so I'm interested in what you

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,640
think right the other winning robots

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,740
ultimately going to be form follows

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,320
function right and they'll take the

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,030
shapes right necessary to be really

00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,650
great for a particular thing or are they

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:35,650
going to be general purpose right and

00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,660
probably anthropomorphic right do you

00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:40,630
think we will have autonomous things

00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,310
that work the way we do or things that

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,250
were completely differently because

00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:47,160
that's more functional oh okay

00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:51,520
functional seems to be winning that one

00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:53,890
okay so a new business model that people

00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,320
are wrapping on top of services is data

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:59,080
right this idea that the money is in the

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,050
data and I think that's actually going

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,270
to turn out to be for me in many cases

00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:06,550
something of a red herring especially

00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,770
for small startups right and the reason

00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,320
for that is that data can also be a

00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,910
liability right is that there's a

00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,250
current trend where the sort of business

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,519
model is the V you tell the VCS are we

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:18,440
going to gather all of the state

00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:21,379
the problem is you're going to get

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,700
hacked right and so you really have to

00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:24,289
account for that just like with the

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,999
services business model you have to say

00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:27,679
I really have to think about how

00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:29,359
expensive it's going to be for me to

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,820
manage a million of these things when

00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:34,879
some of them are in Outer Mongolia right

00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,619
with the data models you have to say

00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:38,869
okay there's that I have to essentially

00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:40,609
put a cost on all the data that I earn

00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:42,070
it's not free right it's like the rain

00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:44,839
forest right we should put a price on it

00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,309
because there's a risk there when you're

00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:48,729
managing other people's data it's a real

00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:51,409
responsibility and it can be challenging

00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:55,539
security of all forms can be even more

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:55,539
difficult right just this week and

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:01,249
d-link makes a lot of things published

00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:03,799
the cryptographic keys that they use to

00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:05,749
sign the software for said things so now

00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,839
you and anybody else can write windows

00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:10,729
drivers for d-link stuff and and that

00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:14,119
can do anything in the windows kernel so

00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:16,249
that's pretty scary right and and the

00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,529
reason I point this out is another one

00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:20,119
just this week right this is beautiful

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,829
right there's a whole bunch of Linux

00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,190
devices out there that got like some

00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:28,149
sort of built yocto whatever on the day

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,829
image it's like riddled with holes and

00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:32,149
now there's a battle of malware you've

00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:34,009
got Malware going in there to turn those

00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,749
things into spam bots and some kind soul

00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:37,159
has written another kind of malware to

00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:38,629
go in there and clear out all the other

00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,959
kind of malware so we've got this like

00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:45,829
IOT mail malware Game of Thrones going

00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:47,539
on between between good notionally

00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:49,339
goodbye good guys and bad guys I think

00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,629
the good guys are just sort of cleaning

00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:54,019
up so that they can earn those things

00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:55,849
properly themselves mmm and so this is

00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:59,359
why we put so much effort into again

00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:02,329
into the security primitives of a bunch

00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,799
of core right to be able to say first go

00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:06,739
to keep these apps completely contained

00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,679
so if one app gets compromised right not

00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:11,690
only can it not go and write to another

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:17,359
app space or read from another app space

00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:19,159
but the anything that compromises it has

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,619
only compromised it can't jump out of

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,179
that container effectively and go and

00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,970
compromise something somewhere else

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:27,500
right and this is the stuff trust me in

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,789
the lab you really don't need to be

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,030
thinking about right what you want to be

00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:31,260
doing is focusing on the

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,560
on the stuff that's going to make your

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,750
stuff great right not on the kind of

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,550
housekeeping right otherwise you end up

00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:42,480
like having something great with really

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:44,310
bad housekeeping right so by containing

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,409
and isolating all of the applications

00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,820
who essentially minimize the risk of a

00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,320
compromise there will be compromises

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,150
right we've got to contain those

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,490
minimizer's plus the update mechanism

00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:55,830
allows us to fix them right and that's

00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:58,590
incredibly valuable for anything that's

00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:02,910
gone from the lab into into the world

00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:07,950
okay and so our final test of your

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:12,020
opinions and your views on acceptable

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,020
business models right

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:29,880
I believe it's illegal in some states so

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:33,190
um right so only a question half in jest

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,630
right because again people often think

00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,640
about business models and they think

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:37,960
about the places where you have huge

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,430
amounts of money you know like defense

00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,700
it's a horrible place to do business

00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:45,130
right or huge organizations huge

00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,530
companies you know Boeing right really

00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,880
tough to build up the sort of

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,620
relationship to work with those very

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,420
large institutions if you inside those

00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:54,610
institutions and you're passionate about

00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,010
this stuff you're going to go super fast

00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:59,170
right because this stuff is so hot your

00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,630
companies want the stuff to fly

00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,400
literally and so if you've got the tools

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,930
on the Wonder and the insights and

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,330
skills you're going to go you know

00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,010
ballistic but if you're outside of those

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,690
organizations as a small organization

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,430
it's just incredibly difficult to

00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,620
connect to them things like that DARPA

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,270
project are enormously valuable because

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,270
they essentially find efficient ways to

00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:20,950
connect small brilliant ideas with no

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,500
track record with those large

00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:25,240
institutions that are all about track

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,890
record right and track records expensive

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,320
and takes time by the time you have a

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:32,380
track record this disruption and

00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:34,210
opportunity will be done right so you

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,070
really have to think about that the

00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,990
reason this is interesting is because

00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:42,790
you should never understand estimate

00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:44,680
right entertainment as a business right

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,270
if you look at if you look at how people

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,750
you know look at the web and what one

00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:54,870
the web cat videos right porn

00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:58,090
entertainment is an enormously important

00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,440
kind of field of Commerce and I think a

00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,070
lot of the stuff that's in the labs

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,730
today is going to show up first as

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:09,310
entertainment right fun family you know

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,320
stuff to do with the family people you

00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,120
know there's an enormous pressure on

00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,300
people's time and so they're willing to

00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,230
spend money right for to engage and to

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:22,570
have fun doing new things so I'm very

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:24,820
excited about some work that one of our

00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,070
teams is doing with organizations

00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,809
focused on the Internet of toys right

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:31,910
Internet of Things seems kind of

00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:35,029
personal but I love the idea of the

00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,979
Internet of toys right first creating a

00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:39,199
new generation of inventors right

00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:41,660
because think about what you can invent

00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,609
if you don't have to make the thing

00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:48,769
right come back to that app store idea

00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:51,529
right and we can make every every you

00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:54,140
know bright kid be an inventor and a

00:37:51,529 --> 00:37:56,749
roboticist if we can essentially give

00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:58,999
them that platform Rose is a huge step

00:37:56,749 --> 00:38:01,880
in that direction but if we come up a

00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:03,410
level right and say just assume that you

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,410
have a robot that can do amazing things

00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,420
now what can you dream with that and how

00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:11,209
much fun can you have with that so I'm

00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,739
super excited about work that

00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:15,920
Canonical's doing around the internet of

00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:18,650
toys right because I think play is a

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,180
great way to learn and play is a great

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:26,599
way to invent ultimately for all of you

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:28,579
guys and whether you are going to stay

00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,640
in the labs you know whether your your

00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:35,539
mission in life is to is to invent the

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,549
perfect way to do something in software

00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:39,559
or hardware or whether your mission in

00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:41,179
life is to build amazing products or

00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,249
with your admission admission is life is

00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:44,329
to build an amazing business what's

00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:46,699
going to be key for you is your ability

00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:48,589
to focus and so one of the things I hope

00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:52,609
you're one of the great privileges that

00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:54,679
I have is to is to make platforms that

00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:56,420
allow people to focus on the stuff that

00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:58,640
they really want to do differently right

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,259
just in the last 10 years the list of

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,599
things that people have built on a bun

00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:03,949
to is incredible because they could just

00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,359
say well that's going to be there I'm

00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:10,849
going to focus on the stuff that I need

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:13,039
to do right uber Spotify Instagram and

00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,539
the way that happened is that always

00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,130
what we've done is we've said okay this

00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:18,380
is a special crowd of people there are

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:19,849
kind of like artists scientists crazy

00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,449
people and they're always trying to make

00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:25,429
very difficult things work and 12 years

00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:26,929
ago that was Linux right like Linux is

00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:29,179
really really difficult so he said fine

00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:30,890
let's hire a bunch of guys and we'll

00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:33,079
make linux for human beings linux that

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,329
anybody can get access to right there's

00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,819
no economic barrier to getting access to

00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:39,170
it there's no usability barrier to

00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:40,180
getting access to so we just unleash

00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,230
your imagination

00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,030
right then 25 years later we noticed

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,480
that the special crowd of people we're

00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:51,579
trying to make linux work in VMs that

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,470
had like dynamic host names that were

00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:54,970
only around for an hour and the turned

00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,309
out that there was just like a world of

00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,859
paper cuts because linux all of our

00:39:57,309 --> 00:40:02,589
Linux's had been built to be installed

00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:04,720
once and last ten years right not to be

00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:07,930
installed 500 times and lost 10 minutes

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,640
right and so we had to go through a bone

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:13,150
too and make a whole bunch of changes

00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,069
right small things lots of kind of tweak

00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,329
some assumptions cleared out and so on

00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,069
just to make it super easy we all say

00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:20,770
give me a machine on Amazon it and I go

00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:22,720
and we unleash this fantastic creativity

00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,280
on the cloud it was people were going to

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,740
do great stuff on the cloud anyway right

00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,410
but we made it go faster just by taking

00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,869
care of all of that housework and today

00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,849
it's this today this is what I see right

00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:36,910
that same crowd of people right there

00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,160
tinkering soul during putting stuff

00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:42,280
together and again there's this huge

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:47,349
world of paper cuts right cryptographic

00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:50,140
keys updates SSH flaky networks and if

00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:52,750
we can make that all disappear right so

00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:55,480
you can focus on just grabbing some

00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:59,319
hardware grab grab some stuff rose and

00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:02,079
apps right will I think will unleash the

00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:03,880
same kind of creativity for you and for

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,170
a million other people who want to want

00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,329
to build on the stuff that you are

00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:09,609
building stand on your great shoulders

00:41:07,329 --> 00:41:13,359
but and to do that we have to allow you

00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:17,109
to focus and it's always a bit of a kind

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,970
of exploration right so what I want this

00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:21,190
weekend what I really hope to get this

00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,839
weekend is just to listen to all of your

00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:25,660
problems right like what's difficult

00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:27,549
what do you love what's easy what would

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,770
you like to make easy because that's

00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:35,109
what we do that's the that's the core

00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:37,150
story all of them too and I think well

00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:38,690
nobody has an opinion of the question of

00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,079
the day clearly

00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:45,069
and i think that's it Brian thank you

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,069
very much have a great weekend

00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,390
questions yes one in the back

00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:14,030
integration I can you slow

00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,760
right so yes sure so I think the

00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:30,580
questions about you know how do we

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,440
support validation and integrity and

00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,720
continuous integration type processes

00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,970
both in the lab like in the in the build

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,450
process and in the field so one of the

00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:41,950
key ideas of snappy is that the most of

00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,060
their dependencies will be bundled with

00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,800
your software right so it's a huge

00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,810
departure from the traditional approach

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,520
right and the traditional approach is

00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,380
really great if you're if you're in the

00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,840
lab and you and you can fix those

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,340
dependencies and its really efficient

00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,510
there's lots of security benefits to it

00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,740
and so on but when you ship a product

00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,510
right you're going to take

00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,300
responsibility for the security of that

00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,680
device not your users and so you bundle

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,940
all of your dependencies so one of the

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,050
things that we do is we say look you're

00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,310
going to bring your own Python you can

00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,200
bring your own Java you're going to

00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,700
bring your own that tree of libraries

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,750
there is a set of libraries the system

00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,060
provides and if you want to use that

00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:15,190
that's great but we totally understand

00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,349
if you want to shrink wrap the whole lot

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,140
which allows you to do a test process

00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:22,270
which is awesome right which is your

00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,220
knowing exactly what bits for your app

00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,810
are going to land on the device instead

00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,240
of having like 2,000 packages on a

00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:30,369
system you can have like five right and

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,440
so the number of dependencies and moving

00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:33,400
parts is greatly greatly reduced so

00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,700
that's one of the things the other thing

00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,910
is that in your snap you can and I'm

00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,570
describing 1604 but in your snap you can

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:45,250
include to health tests so basically

00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,550
like our smoke tests you can say a

00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:50,290
static test which is like is this should

00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,240
this app stock basically you can look at

00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:54,609
and that script you provide that script

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,020
or hook that can look at data it can say

00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:57,369
look my database is there that data is

00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,609
all well structured the configurations

00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:02,290
grades etc etc thumbs up and the running

00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:03,369
tests which is is is everything that

00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,450
should be running running and does it

00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:06,580
appear to be responding well so you

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,440
provide those and so snappy can do

00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,540
automatic updates right you can publish

00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,700
an update and we will canary it out

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,650
across a million devices like 1% than

00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:16,540
five percent than ten percent and they

00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,190
update run those health checks in the

00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,630
field and if there's a problem we backed

00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,849
up all the data right if there's a

00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,869
problem we do transactional rollback we

00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:24,010
go back to the previous version of

00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:27,160
software the previous version the data

00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:30,520
no change so it's really designed to be

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,110
on Rails right you write the tests

00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,640
and and that update process the health

00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,050
check there will be as good as the tests

00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,340
and we know how that works right the

00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,510
tests are not very good initially and

00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,790
then they get better and better as

00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,050
people you know learn to take get

00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:51,940
confidence and take advantage of that

00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:54,370
does that answer your question hey I was

00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,790
going to be that narrow-minded you don't

00:44:54,370 --> 00:45:00,730
have to repeat that all right thank you

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:03,640

00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:07,000
