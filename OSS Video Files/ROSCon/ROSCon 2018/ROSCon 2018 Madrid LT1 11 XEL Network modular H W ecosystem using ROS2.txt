okay hi my name is Ken I'm a primary

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,620
engineer at robust cooperation now I

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,679
will introduce Sela talk projects which

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:19,770
aim to moderate hardware ecosystem using

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,850
lost to main purpose of Zelda talk is to

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,689
make practical system with

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:31,500
microcontroller jingles - this is the

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,690
premier architecture we are designing we

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,630
are applying this architecture to

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,640
support on top of three rows - at the

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,969
April it can be also used on Adina ID

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,870
and we used this architecture to make a

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:53,160
cell network post as prototype from the

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:57,949
reps concert poster and census cell each

00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,530
cell has on accessible memory area hold

00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:07,680
control table we used it to plug and

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:10,350
play and transmit data currently dynam

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,380
cell protocol is applied for this

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,759
communication and other protocol will be

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,830
applied and added in the future and

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,939
there is the GUI tool and called the

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,930
style manager to access easily or to

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,040
control table for using DDS we are using

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,780
micro at peace

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,770
developed by approach ma on console out

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,490
there are three main features of della

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,490
talk first Eugene style manager you can

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,030
set topic type and name of the sensor

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,280
sensor connected to sensor sell a second

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,680
you can use see it's a sensor

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,430
information as it was the topic by just

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,930
a plug or unplug third Hardware

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,119
completion it were coming out because

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:09,470
page chaining is possible by Dynasty

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:12,110
protocol there are plans for the future

00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:16,640
but time is

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,060
right for our detail please lippo to

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,920
develop monster dot in our wiki or visit

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,970
our booth and we welcome the Earth's

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,900
contribution in any way Thanks

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,900
