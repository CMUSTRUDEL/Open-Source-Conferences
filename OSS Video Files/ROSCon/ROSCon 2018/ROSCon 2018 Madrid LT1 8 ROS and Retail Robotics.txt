hello everyone I'm Aaron Blaisdell I run

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,970
the robotics team at bossanova

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:11,309
and we do retail robotics so I want to

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:15,480
kind of tell you about what retail

00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,490
robots kind of do so retail stores

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,920
actually know surprisingly little about

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,619
their shelves and what's going on in

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,570
their stores day to day because their

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,349
customers are constantly modifying those

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,210
shelves and doing really bad things like

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,669
you ever seen like a package of meat on

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,170
a random shelf yeah that's not good for

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:40,770
them so just not knowing how much of

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,510
each product they have yeah repeat would

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,539
have been nice how much they have on

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:50,340
each item on their shelf at any given

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:55,670
time costs cost them worldwide cost

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:58,500
robot sorry yeah so worldwide costs

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,629
retailers one point one trillion dollars

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,159
annually and so what we at bossanova

00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,439
help them understand is what's missing

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,770
from those shelves and what's in the

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:15,990
wrong place among various other things

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:19,020
and so let's switch over here so what

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:25,970
bossanova actually helps them understand

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:29,009
is that state and how how they can

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:33,030
manipulate that oh we're doing great

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:35,570
okay who needs slides so yeah and so the

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,610
bossa nova focus is on production grade

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,490
real-world robotics in an unconstrained

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,860
environment and so we drive around the

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:47,100
stores and we have lots of these kind of

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,560
things to deal with and currently we're

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,500
delivering in 50 Walmart's every day

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,689
multiple times a day to get them the

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,579
information they need to to support

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,790
their restocking processes and those

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,140
kind of things and right now this if the

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,030
slide was up it would be showing you

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,000
that we have three main development

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,910
offices in Pittsburgh

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,590
Mountain View San Francisco and we also

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,390
have sales offices in the US and UK so

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,150
if you want to go and talk to them today

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,370
feel free

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,590
to go by and feel free to come by in our

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,030
to see us at the kauffman coffee and ask

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,710
us questions about how we actually do

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,539
all of this so thanks for listening

00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,539
