let's restart it so my name is aadmi

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,740
tree and and I work in LG Silicon Valley

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,389
lab as well and my video is exactly

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,510
three minutes up at the end of the video

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,689
I'll just jump on the stage what you can

00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,449
see right now is a simulator which we

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,769
built with the unity 3d and we

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,980
integrated it with us

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,519
so you can run autonomous system like

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,540
Baidu

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:38,120
Apollo or outer wear with the simulator

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:42,960
we mainly look at the integration with

00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:46,710
with autonomous vehicle and we have

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,680
multiple things in there you can

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,289
basically see that we have a multiple of

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,960
use from the cameras we have an

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,680
integration with slider with Ryder with

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,550
radar we have also an ability to

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,640
generate 3d maps from the simulator

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,960
itself so if you just make the map put

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,720
it into the place where Apollo wants to

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,340
find it and it is possible to load it

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,950
and just to run it there so we aim to

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,869
make it really easy to use for

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,490
developers so if you're not playing

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:30,869
around without we're always Apollo you

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:35,430
can find the simulator on a github and

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:40,200
if you want more information we can have

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:43,500
conversation on on on iOS next week what

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,320
you can see here is basically the

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,470
simulator running to beat Apollo it is

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,100
able to follow the path it is able to

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:57,049
see the obstacles and also predict the

00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:03,329
motions of other vehicles and it is also

00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:07,049
using a virtual cameras to basically see

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:10,679
the red lights we didn't actually do any

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:14,849
changes in a power to make it run

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,610
all changes are in simulator itself yeah

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,840
and the later you will be able to see

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,569
that it's actually able to simulate a

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,579
kind of sophisticated environment where

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:30,959
multiple vehicles are at the

00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:34,890
intersection and you can see right now

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:41,220
and like from the right side you can see

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:51,599
how Apollo underst like sees everything

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:55,040
around it that's mostly if you're

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,040
interested yeah just

00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,270
