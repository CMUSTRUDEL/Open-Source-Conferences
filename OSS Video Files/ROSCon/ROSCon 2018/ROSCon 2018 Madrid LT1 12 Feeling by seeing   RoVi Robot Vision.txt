so hi everyone I'm Ruben I'm an

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,960
electrical engineering student from the

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,540
Technical University of Munich and today

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,210
I'm going to talk about a camera based

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,790
sensor for smart robots from roving

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,039
robot vision which is a spinoff from the

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,100
Technical University of Munich

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,130
so Rovi mainly aims to improve the

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,890
affordability of robot arms but still

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,130
maintaining a relatively high precision

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,289
and current intelligent arms they rely

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,719
out on all kinds of electronic sensors

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,510
for example joint encoders for storage

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,579
sensors or haptic sensors and this makes

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,850
the system rather complex and also

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,430
results in relatively high costs so the

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,309
key idea of Rovi is to use a camera

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,250
based sensing technology which replaces

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:53,489
the electronic sensors you need on a

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,230
robot arm and so you can build an

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,850
entirely sensorless robot arm which

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,530
should reduce the entire costs yes and

00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,260
the solution actually relies on three

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,650
components first is a camera which looks

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,689
onto the robot arm and second is passive

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,180
elements for example visual markers

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,580
depicted here in green and passive

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,950
flexible elements like rubber films and

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,430
also you of course need an image

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,590
processing software which searches for

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,220
the components of the robot arm in the

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,920
camera image Roby builds like three

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,170
prototypes so on the left you can see a

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,329
robot finger with two passive tactile

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,280
sensors actually it's just a three

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,729
different part with two rubber foam bars

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,729
so and this robot rubber foam bars they

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,030
deform when getting in contact with an

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:47,280
object and so this deformation is sensed

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,530
by the camera and therefore you can

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,930
calculate the forces in the middle you

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,210
see this robot finger integrated into a

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,210
gripper system and on the right is a

00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,579
camera controlled robot arm based on

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,000
off-the-shelf hardware sent Hardware

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,430
parts and which is entirely sensorless

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,039
so except for the camera you have no

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,649
sensors on this robot and as for the

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,629
software part everything is of course

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,250
built in Rus and fully integrated into

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,670
movie

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,040
and for the last applicant or a slight

00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,140
Ruby is looking for partners investors

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,390
and team members and if you have any

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:27,080
questions or are interested feel free to

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,750
contact us or visit the iris booth where

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,210
we also will present the robot arm thank

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,619
you

00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,619
