what am I did I'm Carlos as Matt and I

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,410
lead a robotics team at piaggio fast

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,839
forward Pho fast forward is a member of

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,710
the piaggio group that you might know

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,840
from brands like the Vespa Aprilia moto

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,439
Guzzi all those light transportation

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,810
vehicles

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,369
so at piaggio fast forward we we're

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:35,820
based in Boston and we are making Drita

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:39,390
so Drita is it's a word in Italian that

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,309
means the short trip and it's a robot

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,460
that follows you around and carries your

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,350
things so when I joined the company the

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:52,020
company is very young when I joined it

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:55,320
we didn't have any robot or only a few

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,410
prototypes and after nine months we were

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,329
able to to finalize a robot that could

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:05,129
accomplish all these things and do that

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:10,650
in in an instructor environment so this

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:15,810
is what it looks like being a being an

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:18,900
Italian company we are very focused in

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,380
design and making sure that things are

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,530
not only functional but that they look

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,530
pretty good

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:31,110
so yeah so that's jitta it follows you

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,560
around you open it up you put your stuff

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:38,490
inside and then it carries it the the

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,440
main challenge of this is not to make a

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,600
robot that does this because thanks to

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,490
Ross and thanks to all these open tools

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
we were able to put this together pretty

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,930
quick

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,390
however the challenge is to make this as

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,380
an affordable technology and so that's

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,229
so that's what we've been working on

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,869
basically bringing this and making it

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,369
into a consumer product and that's

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,729
that's also something that we want to

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,690
carry Ross with with us into that jump

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:14,340
as well so the world many many

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:16,050
challenges and the joy worked yeah so I

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,090
mean we had to build a team and then we

00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,690
had to basically architect this entire

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,090
system and it took a lot a lot of work

00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:28,370
but yeah I just wanted to thank everyone

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:33,239
who made cross possible and and also

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:35,040
just saying that we are also hiring and

00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:39,390
we're growing a lot and it's a lot of

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,960
fun to address all these challenges so

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,759
thank you

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,759
