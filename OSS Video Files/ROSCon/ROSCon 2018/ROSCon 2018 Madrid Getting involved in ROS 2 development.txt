hi everyone yes that's it I'm Deanna

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,470
from a perma buttocks work on Ross -

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,510
they're my colleague Mikael as well who

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,190
you heard from before we put this talk

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,990
together to answer one of the questions

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,299
that we get asked most frequently at

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,320
Ruskin which is how can I contribute to

00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,880
Rus - so there are a lot of options we

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,710
like to think that there's something for

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,180
everyone but this is a short talk so

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,330
there are gonna be a lot of links

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,189
instead of details so if you want to

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,109
download the slides this is the link to

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,649
do that but in general I'm gonna start

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,840
with sort of and an overview of the

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,629
processes that we go through in ROS - in

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,820
general and then start to call out

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,460
different entry points for places that

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,950
are good for a contribution so to start

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,079
with the general workflow for features

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,570
in ROS - particularly for large features

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,449
like rust bag or rust lunch we're gonna

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,670
start with a discussion try to get some

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:00,030
feedback from the community as an

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,030
example the rust to work for navigation

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,220
there's a discourse post where he asked

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,900
what worked well in ROS one would can we

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,180
maybe change for the better and this

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,630
input from the community helps to shape

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,670
the direction of the projects so that

00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,710
then gets condensed into what we refer

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,450
to as a design doc and this tries to

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,040
capture the decisions that have been

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,810
made and sort of the rationale behind

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,790
each of them and also the high level

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,390
goal for a feature or whatever work is

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,820
being done so as an example that nodes

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,500
can have their namespace remapped or

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,079
topics renowned for the command line

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,920
there's a design doc that was written

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,799
first for that

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,840
that explains consider how it worked in

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,380
Rose Wan what needs to be different for

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,720
ROS to what syntax we might consider in

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,369
the different use cases that that allows

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,890
or maybe doesn't allow what's in or

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,990
what's out and generally that sort of

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,460
high-level overview of how we want it to

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,250
work not necessarily the technical

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,380
details of how exactly it's implemented

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,860
so once we're on the same page with that

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,149
we move to the code changes and for

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,600
something that is a large feature like

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,780
this we try to first step back and start

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,039
with kind of an overview of wire what

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,690
the different code changes are going to

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,690
look like so again

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,700
in the case of remapping we have this

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,370
sort of meta ticket on github because

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,650
our hope the Rasta code is hosted on

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,120
github and then changes are made through

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,650
what we refer to as pull requests and

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,510
sometimes these pull requests will be

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,410
made sort of incrementally and so it's

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:33,450
good to outline the different stages the

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,950
reviewers of code can expect it's gonna

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,680
start with sort of minimal functionality

00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,180
and then over time once the groundwork

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,080
is there add more functionality at a

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,770
time and also we think we whoever is

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,170
developing the feature think that the

00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,240
given the the layered stack of rows too

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,680
we think that maybe the function this

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,510
functionally is gonna live at the core

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,160
and the different data structures that

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,330
are gonna be used in the different

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,870
client libraries this is something that

00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,710
we want to get all on the same page on

00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,940
before the work actually starts so then

00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,830
of course there are a number of for

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,870
requests that get in and at some point

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,240
the feature reaches the stage where it's

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,310
ready for release in packaging which is

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,170
sort of the process through which the

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,820
code gets bundled into something that

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,170
users can install without needing to

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,310
know that there was ever code in the

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,720
first place um there are status pages

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,640
that sort of will show you the different

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,980
packages that have been released as well

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,220
for us one as you might be aware of in

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,170
Ross okay they exist in rows two like

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,830
you might have been aware of in Ross one

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,380
but the point is that there exists a

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,600
time in a features life cycle where it

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,030
has been implemented in the code but not

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,360
necessarily released and packaged out

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,489
for users to install but when that

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,980
happens there is usually an extra step

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,890
which involves a bit of celebration

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,720
so recapping then the workflow for

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,220
future development again this is in

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
general and then we'll call out for

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,060
contribution entry points in a minute

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,800
it'll usually go through this sequence

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,959
of steps but it's not necessarily a one

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,879
and done process there are a number of

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,980
times where we iterate back and forth

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:14,290
through these steps and it can be the

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,269
new information comes up maybe a year

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,340
later that causes us to revisit one of

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,260
the decisions that we made in a design

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:25,270
dot so and then we go back and iterate

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:27,820
through those so usually there's another

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,580
flow that's happening in parallel that

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,770
was the feature workflow that's more for

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,180
developers but also the users will

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,820
usually going through more of the

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,770
troubleshooting work so and this starts

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,720
the entry point for that is usually Ross

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,550
answers where you can get a lot of your

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,430
troubleshooting done and occasionally

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,680
that will spin off into an issue on

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,440
github that says there's this bug or

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,710
there's some feature requests that we we

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,139
as a community would like to see so this

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,389
is another workflow that happens again

00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,930
I'm just laying groundwork here and this

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:05,470
is more of the user facing one so now we

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,990
probably have enough that we can start

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,750
considering the opportunities for

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,200
contribution so the user facing

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,060
opportunity one of them if you're

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,350
getting familiar with Ross - as a user

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,090
then you might be able to answer some

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,510
questions that come up from other users

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,760
of Ross - so if you browse answers no

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,910
trusted or with the Ross - tag if you

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,410
can submit any answers but also try to

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,789
take a step back and think like why are

00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,289
people asking these questions there

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,330
might be somewhere in the documentation

00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,860
that you can help us to improve it might

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,930
even be something that sort of only

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,120
users can see sometimes we're too close

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:44,320
to these things to know how is best to

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,030
improve this documentation also as a

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,520
user you might come across something

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:51,010
that's not working correctly or not as

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,800
you expected and so this then can lead

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,979
to a bug report but there are some steps

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,720
are important that you take in order to

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,080
create a bug report that's sort of

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,520
usable so I'll call out to some links in

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,340
a minute for each of these yellow

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,650
bubbles but in general I

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,470
are there's particular information that

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,970
we need in order to get the right the

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,230
right context about a bug report and

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,060
there's troubleshooting that you can go

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,960
through in order to narrow the scope of

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:24,070
where that bug might live looking back

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,860
at this feature workflow this is more

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,770
getting into the area of less sort of

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,199
user facing ways to contribute a more of

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,360
developer facing ways to contribute so

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,240
contributing code is of course one of

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,740
them it can be that it is if it's a

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,400
large feature then it's gonna go through

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:45,460
all of these steps but it we also have

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,260
some tasks that we've carved out from

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,790
larger features maybe all of the design

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,430
has been done already but there's one

00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:53,260
aspect of the implementation that is yet

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,389
to be done and we have a list of those

00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,630
sorts of tasks but then different users

00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:02,580
or developers users as you wish can

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:05,050
contribute as part of a bigger process

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,419
if you don't have time for contributing

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,539
code one of the things that experienced

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,400
users from Ross one can do to help Russ

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:16,120
too is to give input on these design

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,919
discussions a lot of different use cases

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,510
in Ross one it's important to hear from

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,490
all of them and even if you just go and

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,990
say I agree that's very valuable

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:29,220
feedback for us to hear so this is the

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,680
process that we recommend for Russ to

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,169
development because we is the process

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,880
that we've found is most likely to have

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,620
everyone on the same page at the

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,270
different steps and so then you're

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,389
likely to actually get the code in at

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,970
the end but for your own projects is

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:49,990
totally up to you how many of these

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:52,270
different pieces of the puzzle you want

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,750
to incorporate into your project if you

00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,030
have time as an organization to take on

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,530
one of these features from one to four

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,419
then that's something that as an

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,150
organization people can contribute

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,430
larger features but also if you're just

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,410
working on your own projects sort of off

00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,770
on the side then there's the opportunity

00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,050
for you to tackle it as you wish we just

00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:17,620
ask that in the end you can contribute

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,240
back to the community as we know that

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,060
sort of the community is what

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,289
behind Ross one end - is what makes the

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,780
ecosystem so great so recapping then

00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:30,819
you'll see that there are a number of

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,099
different ways you can contribute to

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,539
Russ - and it's gonna sort of depend on

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,510
your profile the resources that you have

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,979
available your experience we you don't

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,680
have to be like a really experienced

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,750
developer we or have had open source

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,970
experience before we have particular

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,850
tubs that have been carved out for

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,200
especially for new contributors so we

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,410
like to think there's something for

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,060
everyone take a look at these links tap

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,770
someone on the shoulder maybe there's

00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,240
someone next to you that has gone

00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:04,980
through this process before and yeah ask

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,980
around and if not ask us

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:13,270
[Applause]

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:36,150
let me ask you a question which you

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:39,850
recommend for our new Wii user or a

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:43,630
student that really begins with Rose

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:48,310
which is the the form you recommend to

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:51,460
contribute so I think in this case to

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:54,850
make I mean two ways we would see is so

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,040
we use a lot of labels on and one of

00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,110
them is good first issue and so if

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,330
people actually look at like look for a

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,340
good first issue labels most of them are

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:04,660
like died size contribution that unless

00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,930
they require a lot of knowledge about

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,760
how rose to work and and then if it's a

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,080
programming language that people like

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,380
knows they should be able to contribute

00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,280
and twist like not too much work another

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:22,000
ways you can really like even if you

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,890
have very little experience it's a lot

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,140
of questions and answers that Prospero

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,750
rose to that that you would be surprised

00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,890
how much moles and some other people you

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,630
know and they are always new people

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,230
coming and so answering question is very

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,230
very other thing

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:47,180
so the question is is there any

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,490
financial incentive to work on rusty

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,990
I don't want we don't have a bounty

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,850
system or something similar I think

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,360
that's a decision above my paygrade

00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,500
I don't know if there is a plan for it

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,210
but there are a lot of organizations

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,440
that are like starting and including

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:08,570
like with the TC contributing people

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,600
contracting or SOF to allow to move

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,950
faster on the roads to development and

00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,840
there is a lot of interest in that cross

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,010
to moving faster so I wouldn't be

00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:26,300
surprised there are some opportunities

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:28,220
for contracting for some companies I so

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,050
these are always how to get in touch

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,420
with the people who are doing things or

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,610
how to find some topics but can you just

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,050
right now give some topics for tasks

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,860
that you're actually looking for help

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,410
with I mean launch you know that was

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,210
mentioned I'm guessing actions so I

00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,820
think yes there are several parts

00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:48,350
available actions like not connections

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,670
are good example like actually something

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,710
that has been discussed we don't have

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,510
like a design document like merged yet

00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,270
so it's some things that like is more

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:59,390
like the first type of exists work flow

00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,650
lounge there is a design document and

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,820
like several pieces reference

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,250
implementations that have been pushed

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,200
but they are still several parts missing

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,360
and for other thing I mentioned earlier

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,980
like roster modes or like we hope even

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,180
further in the development process but

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,460
there are a lot of small pieces missing

00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,700
and all of them has their own negative

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,230
issues so it's a matter of like how

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,930
early in the development you want to be

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,760
but like all these topics could leverage

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,750
some contribution either

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:31,310
opinions or code contribution so with be

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,920
a source of topics as well yes so the

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,140
road map is definitely a good good

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,570
source and then we have I think we have

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,460
that in the links here we have like a

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,200
water ball Kanban board we use to

00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,150
aggregate all the issues and also rose

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,650
to repositories and

00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:48,140
we have labels in there on things that

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,750
like we want to get in by the next

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,970
release and these also like things that

00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:56,000
are like higher priorities that the rest

00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,440
of the issues to us and so in general

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,160
like anything that has the crystal

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,930
milestone needs or Berg label are things

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,140
that like are very good like we're

00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:10,280
looking for fixing soon and this early

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:14,530
in house thank you thank you very much

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,530
