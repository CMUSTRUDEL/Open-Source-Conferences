hello my name is your hand right here

00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:07,799
from pills and I'll talk about service

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,370
for body modules from pills it's a small

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,410
or medium-sized company from Germany

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:17,340
offering a safe automation product and

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,240
services and pills launched its robot

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,869
manipulator PR bTW it's a six axis robot

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,300
this year and has six kilograms of

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,920
payload 24 volts power supply which

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,610
makes it perfectly suited for mobile

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,370
applications and it has can open

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,260
interface that we use to command it

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:43,800
directly from Ross so a turn trajectory

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,870
having individual joint positions over

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,610
time is directly commanded of the

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,530
keynote and interface to the individual

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,879
drives so you can use Ross as a robot

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,010
controller you do not have a vendor

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,520
specific Robert controller if you use

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,719
this manipulator that can use the can

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,489
open interface directly therefore in

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,010
industry you'll probably often have

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,119
linear and point-point movements where

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,630
you want to have reliable reproducible

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,299
commands with trapezoidal velocity

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,000
profiles and with support from Rosen we

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,509
developed a package called the factory

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,450
generation integrated with the movie and

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,820
the Ross control stick to generate and

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,270
retractor ease for a given linear

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,630
command check out the code it's open

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:41,630
source at the pills robots or pills

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,979
industrial motion package what's next we

00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,710
look into integrating more pills

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,950
products like the laser scanner or like

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,090
our safety met interest to get those

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,450
data into a unified environment model

00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:03,240
and with the large potential into using

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:07,469
Ross as a platform for Ross and yeah

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,119
just meet us we welcome feedback try it

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,180
out let us know what you think about it

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,860
and

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,360
we are over in the coffee breaker there

00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,280
was another booth where you can see the

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,439
Fitz manipulator in action see you there

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,439
