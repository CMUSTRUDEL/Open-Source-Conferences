my name is Martin Eden and I'm from the

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,970
TMZ technology consulting my colleague

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,830
presented this morning I'll work on

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,860
porting artists and now having finished

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,049
that we are still being paid by Bosch to

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,519
now work on Ross back so I wanted to

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,320
give you a quick overview because I

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,800
think this is very much anticipated

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,630
feature for us too if you if you want to

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,550
get involved or see whether your use

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,250
case will be covered there's a design

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,840
document that you can have looked at so

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,130
in principle there was a video I don't

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,880
know whether this will this will

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,760
probably not work this is why I had it

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,530
also so let's let's first have a quick

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,000
look at what the status is I will show

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,550
you a video where this is actually

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,550
working so we can do recording and

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,329
playing and we are storing into an

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,250
SQLite free back end so no performance

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,530
tests have been done except in advance

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,170
where we check that SQLite worship

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,010
should should also have very performant

00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,809
use cases

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,420
hello very performant use cases the

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,790
SQLite back-end is a plugin so if you're

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,400
really unsure that this will work for

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,100
you you can already start implementing

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
your own plugin the code is there also

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,729
if you want to help we can use some help

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,280
implementing some plug-in to to read old

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:24,270
Rosberg ones for from rows one because

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,350
this would be very useful so let's see

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,350
whether I can get the video too

00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,070
no probably not so because for some

00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,020
reason anyway as I said B yes exactly

00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,100
there we are so as you can see we have

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,840
some fabricated data

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,500
it's obviously not real data and now we

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,780
just press Rosberg record and it will do

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,729
something storage will set we set up it

00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,950
will actually use the serialized data

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:00,680
from the middle WAV format and store

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,420
this directly this is much faster but

00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,520
it's also not portable to all formats

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,840
right so there will be some conversion

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,550
plugins but this has not been

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,340
implemented yet

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,040
now we stopped it and we are going to

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:17,690
play it back so there we go

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:21,080
Rosberg play back as I said this is

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,050
sqlite3 back-end and there we go

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,250
the timing behavior should be accurate

00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:30,140
except if you're trying to to Ross back

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,030
your whole car setup I guess the

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,590
performance will not be as good there

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,040
but the architecture should in principle

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,540
allow for this so as I said maybe this

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,660
is already interesting for you maybe you

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,180
want to play around or even help us or

00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:47,830
even start to develop your own storage

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,189
plugins alright that's it

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,189
