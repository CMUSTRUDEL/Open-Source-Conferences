hi everyone my name is Adam Alami and

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,450
this is July flu and from we are from

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,059
the IT University of Copenhagen and we

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,040
are part of the rosen project the Rossum

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,350
project has been running for over a year

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,529
and we thought it's an opportunity to

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,840
come and provide an update to the wider

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,960
community this is a two-part

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,289
presentation my part is more about the

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,840
process how we go in about implementing

00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,570
Rose rose in quality assurance practices

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:38,850
and initiative and July is more about

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:42,149
building tools for passing testing so

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:48,120
what has been going on and the rose in

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:50,340
project we establish a working group a

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,309
quality assurance working groups as a

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,109
mechanisms of representing the community

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,600
and as a conduit for the rosen project

00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,760
and the community so it's a decision

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,610
mechanism it's a branch storm in

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,610
mechanism for the for photo Rose in

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,170
initiatives working group so what do we

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,689
do at the working group who were meeting

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,340
a monthly basis and we discussed the

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,350
initiatives of the Rosen's

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,900
and we discuss how to go about

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:23,610
implementing them and we do the work

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:27,600
basically what are these Rosen

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,240
initiatives we compiled 16 initiatives

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,210
with pakistan's and two for iteration of

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,720
implementations and these the first

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:39,180
iteration is making Rose quality visible

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,100
the second the second initiative is a

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,380
point ownership for these Rosen

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,720
initiatives the third initiatives

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,630
energize the code review process the

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,490
current code review process the fourth

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,829
initiative is implementing a code

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,380
scanning tool and technique the fifth

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,469
one is addressing the current

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,530
maintenance issues the second iteration

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,600
we will be looking at updating and

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,469
energizing the current continuous

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,610
integration tools and services and

00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,970
implementing a quality hub or a

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,580
knowledge base for quality assurance

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,010
practices

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,770
and formalize the code review ownership

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,130
process and implementing an onboarding

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,530
process for the core and non-core

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:26,080
community members the third iteration we

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,990
will be looking at putting in place a

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,370
model and the loop testing to

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,860
implementing a continuous improvement

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,250
process automated testing and the

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,980
quality discourse the last iteration we

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,680
will be looking at implementing some

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,990
Quality Assurance promotion events and a

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,190
model driven tool and a hashtag for

00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,950
quality assurance initiatives so how did

00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,770
we come up with this list over a year

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:56,680
ago and I did a talk last year at Ross

00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:59,530
cond we conducted a preliminary study

00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,200
and to the state of Ross quality

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,420
assurance practices and we wanted to

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,450
understand where is the community at

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,390
when it comes to quality assurance

00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:13,390
practices and we have identified a list

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,670
of problems and opportunities and each

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,420
problems and opportunities we propose a

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,400
set of solution to address those

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:26,769
opportunities or to take opportunities

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:30,780
of those opportunities so for example

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:33,370
for a lack of a centralized source for

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,769
community quality assurance practices

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,260
practices and early sharing and

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:41,320
collaborations we do believe that the

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,200
issue comes from a lack of a quality hub

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,019
or a website where knowledge can be

00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,630
shared as a first issue the second issue

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:53,320
to address is a quality discourse as a

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,680
quality forum so what's the intent for

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,350
example of a quality have the intent is

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,450
a single source of truth for Ross

00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:05,140
quality assurance knowledge and

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:07,600
practices and methods so what's the

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,570
output what we excel in tenth from the

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,489
output the output there is a quality

00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:15,430
feature or capability we try to

00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,470
implement into place which is a

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,530
knowledge based sharing for quality

00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:23,289
assurance practices and we intend also

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,570
to create a community impact what the

00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:29,260
community impact we try to

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:31,720
to create it inspire people to share

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,490
knowledge and experience and foster a

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,760
knowledge sharing behavior in the

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,130
community so this is just an example of

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,430
a problem and how we try to address it

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,160
and/or our initiative follow this format

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,950
there is a problem that we see in the

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,810
community and there is an initiative or

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,540
a set of initiative to address it

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:54,180
we intend to create a capability or a

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,310
feature that is a quality assurance

00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,670
capability and by that capability we

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,410
intend to create a community impact so

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,070
where are we at with this initiative

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:09,520
there is some progress five of this

00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:12,120
initiative are working progress and some

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,590
of them have been implemented as phased

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,210
implementations and two of them have

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,880
been fully implemented

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,930
I will go truly quickly through some of

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,300
them and give you an update

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:30,400
making ROS packages quality visible this

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:34,750
is community requirements so ROS user

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,790
wanted at each time they go to a package

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,580
they want to be able to have a

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:43,120
visibility and to the quality of the

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,090
package so we implemented this in two

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,850
phases the first phase is what we call

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:53,740
the CI badge the CI badge gives you an

00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:56,710
indication at each times there is a CI

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,140
run it gives you the result of the run

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,280
the last four to five runs and the

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,710
result of the run

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,320
if there are no defect it goes green if

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:10,420
there is a defect and the last one of

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:14,280
the runs it goes red so the last two

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:17,680
example are two packages with around 50

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,280
150 to 200 test cases one test cases has

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,680
failed and this example over 200 test

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,700
cases and few test cases have been

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,610
running and the last sixer built so what

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,310
we want to do after this thing about we

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,840
want to extend it to something we call a

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,889
quality a quality dashboard what is the

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,569
quality dashboard

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:45,960
as a working group we work to identify

00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:49,090
some software engineering matrix and we

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,819
utilize in a tool called Harris Harris

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,699
we extend the net we working on the

00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,789
package at the moment we extending in

00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,740
Harris to extract these metrics and to

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,930
display these metrics and the value of

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,789
this matrix and the historic of these

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:10,500
metrics for each package so what's the

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:13,449
next initiative appointing ownerships

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,639
we decided as a working group that's the

00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,400
individuals the groups or the company

00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,529
that works in a particular initiative

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,750
and implement the initiative are by

00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:25,060
default the owner of that Quality

00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,919
Assurance initiative at least they say

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,169
otherwise if they say otherwise as a

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,839
group we look for owners in the

00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:33,460
community the same second initiative

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,979
which is a work in progress it has

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,830
commenced so we will be running a pilot

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:41,710
the intent is to energize the current

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,800
code review process so it's a good it's

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:49,419
a process that has been in place however

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,150
it its implementation has been sort of

00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:56,800
abandoned we look at a tree Institute in

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,750
the code review practice and a pilot

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,349
will commence into repository move it

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,599
and RV's so the next initiative is

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:06,969
implementing a code the scanning methods

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:10,389
and tools the word has commencing in

00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:14,560
extending Harris to cover Python but not

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:17,469
only C++ there are two initiative which

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,060
they are in package three and four we

00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:21,909
have implemented because they are easy

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:26,219
to implement the first one is a quality

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:26,219
hub which we implemented within the wiki

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,919
so if you go to do wiki Rose org slash

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:35,440
quality that's the quality hub what is

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,870
missing what we intend to do is because

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,579
it's a wiki we'd like the contribution

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,690
to come from the community so the

00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:46,000
knowledge is community driven so way we

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,060
like people to go if you have a quality

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,610
assurance item or themes in mind and you

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,940
wanna write it up please write it up and

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,060
pub

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,310
or just get in touch with us and we will

00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,460
help you in writing it up and publish it

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:04,510
so it's a wiki it's a community-driven

00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:07,450
it has to come from the community so the

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,400
Quality Assurance forum so the forum has

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,350
been there for nine months if you have

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,800
any question about the work we do in if

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,720
you have any related suggestion

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,170
regarding quality assurance in ROS

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,840
please go and publish it so to sum up

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:27,910
this is the list is a long and extensive

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:29,950
list 16s initiative to implement so if

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,930
you feel excited about quality assurance

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,280
and he wants to contribute please get in

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,750
touch thank you July

00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,750
