hi everyone my name is alipin waha dan

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,440
and I'm a project engineer at hi-tech

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,540
robotics today I will introduce you to

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,219
guy tech BCI which is raw space

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,559
comprehensive hardware and software

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,560
platform for building interesting brain

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,439
robot interfacing applications so we

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,330
have Ross and neuroscience experts in

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:29,160
our team who worked very hard to come up

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:31,969
with this product so so I would reflux

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,800
plain how brain computer interface works

00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,719
our brain has billions of neurons which

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,000
carries information in form of

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,210
electrical charges these electrical

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,640
activity produces electrical potential

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,280
on scalp which are very minut in

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,920
magnitude but can be measured using

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,390
metallic electrodes according to

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
research this electrical activity

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,859
correlates with the underlying brain

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,030
activity so researchers try to extract

00:00:57,859 --> 00:01:02,750
features out of these time series

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,949
signals and eg based brain computer

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,500
interfacing has number of interesting

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,799
and potential applications in

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,720
rehabilitation robotics neuromarketing

00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,070
self-driving cars and entertainment and

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,170
security so this is a comprehensive and

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,610
high-quality software and hardware

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,240
platform that we have developed so it

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,210
has 10 channel violets non-invasive EEG

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,909
headset it has dry electrodes along with

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,579
set of very useful ross packages and

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,060
ross based software and tools for

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,159
helping researchers especially during

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,799
early phase of BBC application

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,020
development so there are three as you

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,500
can see there are three main Ross

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,200
packages that we have developed you and

00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,380
this is an open source contribution you

00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:02,090
can see the source code at this github

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:07,020
link so this is the AG device and it has

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:12,330
dry spring-loaded electrodes it can for

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:15,120
a hairy part it can get the result

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,370
so get the signals out of it and form

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,160
for me electroform electrodes are for

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,840
bearskin on the forehead so a thorough

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,400
research and development effort has been

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,960
done in order to come up with good

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,600
quality signal acquisition and

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:34,140
processing at hardware level so so I

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,470
will quick be quick so this is the bring

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,250
up package it can bring all the

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:43,770
real-time data from et device and there

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:49,200
are a few other details that you can see

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:57,060
on the github page so I will be quick to

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:59,730
show the demo video can it be played so

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,450
this is where I am trying to control the

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,450
turtle

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,729
