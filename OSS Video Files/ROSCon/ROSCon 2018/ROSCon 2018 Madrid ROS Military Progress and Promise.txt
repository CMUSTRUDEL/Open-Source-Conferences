well good afternoon good afternoon my

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,030
name is Jerry Tobler I work for

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,250
Southwest Research Institute which is an

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,009
independent non-profit research

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,900
institution in San Antonio Texas which

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,190
means that I kind of came to Madrid

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,420
expecting some of the food to be

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,369
familiar and it turns out the Spanish

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
and Mexican food is far more dissimilar

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:27,210
than I expected uh I am excited today to

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,260
get to introduce to you guys a project

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,740
that I've been working on for several

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,300
years and one that I think is pretty

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,910
exciting development in terms of Ross

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,360
and in terms of Robotics in a community

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,629
that doesn't really traditionally work

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,539
the way that this open-source sharing

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:50,070
community does it's called Ross military

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,350
or Rossum and I'm gonna tell you about

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,059
it but to give kind of a motivating

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,370
example I'd like to start off with this

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,180
have you ever have you ever gone to the

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,309
grocery store and you get to the salsa

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:07,020
aisle because in Texas you have a salsa

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,850
aisle and you can't remember if you have

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,710
salsa at home and you've got all these

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,140
chips in your basket you can't remember

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,170
if you've got any salsa for them it's

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,610
gonna be a travesty if you don't because

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,799
they're gonna send you you know back to

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,110
the store and in Madrid it's like a four

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,520
minute walk down to the store but in San

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,710
Antonio it's like a half an hour drive

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,780
out there so you're not gonna get back

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,869
in time for the second half so you go

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,509
ahead and buy one anyway and then you

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,310
get back to you get back to to your

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,900
house and you look in the pantry and

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,579
they're like twelve jars to salsa in

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,450
there already from the last twelve times

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:41,759
you went to the grocery store and

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,320
couldn't remember whether you had salsa

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,320
at home engineers you know we we kind of

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,299
worked like this you know you you are

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,979
kind of thinking about something that

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,530
you need and you can't find it

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,210
immediately on Google you can't find it

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,399
immediately on Ross indexed you type you

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,590
know sudo apt install Ross kinetic

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,840
automated vehicles and nothing really

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,280
comes up so you go ahead and say look

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm gonna just start from scratch I'm

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,930
gonna build my own automated vehicle

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,930
it's gonna be awesome

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,270
unfortunately building an automated

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,800
vehicle as a number of

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,660
in this room no it turns out to be an

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,760
incredibly hard task we are incredibly

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,930
hard is measured in you know millions

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,240
and millions and millions of dollars and

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,770
so if all these jars of salsa were like

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,360
four million dollars you'd be really

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,600
careful about whether you had some

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,920
already at home but it turns out right

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,840
that it's not enough to know how much

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,730
you got you also have to know you know

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,610
which brands have salsa to go with which

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,750
chips you have to know which people who

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,240
are coming over to watch the game with

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,040
you are you know are allergic to these

00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,300
particular ingredients or that like

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,680
these particular ingredients you have to

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,330
pay attention to all of these different

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,650
things and kind of make sure that you

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,970
know what's going on in all of them

00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,260
which salsas are appropriate for which

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,480
situations and which ones are available

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,280
when which groups are coming over and so

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,330
you're an engineer so of course you pull

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,310
out your spreadsheet and you make a

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:04,060
table this is a table of salsas

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,560
obviously you need to rate them

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,200
according to whatever whatever your

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,420
metrics are but this talk is not of

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,840
course actually about the rating of

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,700
salsas although again as a I guess Texan

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,300
at this point I guess I could do an

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,370
entire talk on this instead our table is

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:26,980
much much less delicious it looks like

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:30,520
this so what we have is a list a

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:33,370
spreadsheet of Rosse packages of

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:37,570
robotics packages that are in use by the

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,970
US military and the the basic premise

00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,890
behind this is that it turns out that

00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,450
there are two kind of big problems with

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,730
robotics within the US military

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,170
infrastructure and one of them is the

00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,380
salsa problem that I mentioned which is

00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,970
that you don't don't always know whether

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,380
this particular salsa is appropriate for

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,170
this particular application and so you

00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,610
just buy another one you build from

00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,860
scratch and that's something that

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,720
obviously is incredibly expensive and

00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,040
it's not really something that a lot of

00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,390
Engineers loves to do you don't want to

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,610
start from scratch you want to you know

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,260
move on to the cool new stuff in

00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,300
automated vehicles so we'd like to

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,770
enable that we'd like to enable it in a

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,420
context and this is the other part a

00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,480
context that is not really used to the

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,250
open source philosophy context where in

00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,680
general everything is closed

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:25,020
everything is proprietary everything is

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:28,050
walled off and so Ross military our goal

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,440
is to remove as many of those barriers

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,490
as we can now I want to kind of make

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,590
sure that it's clear at the beginning

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,419
here that we can't remove all the

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,789
barriers we're not just going to start

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,319
posting things on github unfortunately

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:45,569
you're not going to be able to download

00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:47,490
a you know automated tank but actually

00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,840
maybe fortunately you can't download an

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,340
automated tank however I want to say now

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,080
and I'll say again at the end that one

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,599
of the goals this project is actually to

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,340
work with open robotics work with the

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,590
Ross community and be sure that we are

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,360
actually benefiting the entire community

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,949
that we're not just staying within this

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,659
kind of walled garden because even if we

00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,250
can break down a lot of the walls within

00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:13,110
the US government US military

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,940
infrastructure we that's that's good let

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,620
me tell you that's gonna be a success if

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,729
it turns out that this works out the way

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,319
that we are hoping and the way that it

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,539
looks like it's going to but we'd like

00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,849
to make sure that we're also opening up

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,050
to the world wherever that's possible so

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,699
I'd like to give you a kind of a brief

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,009
history of Ross military something I've

00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,530
been involved in from the start I want

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,210
to be very clear that this is by far not

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,590
an effort that is just mine there are a

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,880
number of people in this room there are

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,750
an awful lot of people all over the

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,029
world there are dozens of organizations

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,529
and lots and lots of people who are part

00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:46,199
of this effort it just happens that I'm

00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,490
the one talking today so I want to be

00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,960
clear that this is not just mine this is

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,400
definitely not just Southwest researches

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,979
but it's it's an awful lot of people

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,940
behind this so it started in 2015 when

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,380
we kind of looked at the state of

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,779
military robotics and specifically

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,580
automated vehicles and we said well you

00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,930
know UGVs are being asked that is

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,210
unmanned ground vehicles being asked to

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,180
do an awful lot of tasks an awful lot of

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,090
work and we're asking to acting more and

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,050
more and more of them every day and

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,759
whenever we have a new application we

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,150
have to build a new robot wouldn't be

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,979
nice if we could just build the robot

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,529
once and add new features on top of it

00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,479
as we went like I said military tends to

00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,819
be kind of a walled garden and so when

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,250
you build one feature it tends to belong

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,580
to you and then it's hard to integrate

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,889
that feature onto a different platform

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,349
however we at Southwest Research had had

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,729
some experience through a sequence of

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,130
projects we'd had some experience with

00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,880
doing basically exactly this with a

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,100
technology that we

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,520
call the robotic technology kernel or

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,580
RTK this is a bass autonomy mobility

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,770
platform based on Ross entirely based on

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,790
Ross you know except for the tiny piece

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,060
at the bottom where you actually have to

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,400
drag the car and this is something that

00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,080
we had worked on through the office of

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,240
naval research and now through us our

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,730
meet our deck both which are research

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,740
organizations that enabled us to move

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,240
from vehicle platform to vehicle

00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,400
platform with relatively minor

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,740
reconfiguration enabled us to add new

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,140
features on top of it with relatively

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,060
minor modifications to the base vehicle

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,820
platform and as a result allowed us to

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,410
incorporate new demands new desires from

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,150
some of our clients a little bit faster

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,070
in some cases a lot faster than you

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,140
might otherwise expect especially when

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,430
you're used to military projects that

00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,790
are measured in decades instead of

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,930
months this picture right here is one of

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,430
the vehicle that we've used the picture

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,870
itself is not necessarily important but

00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,420
I felt like I needed a picture to go

00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,730
with that one so I did and the next

00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,810
piece of this so this is two pieces that

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,310
kind of came together to make Ross

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,200
military something that we knew would be

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,540
useful the next piece of course is Ross

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,760
itself generally when I give a talk like

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,650
this it turn I didn't have to sell

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,900
people on Ross and explain why Ross is a

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,130
good idea and all the benefits that

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,780
you're gonna get out of it so I'm really

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,600
hoping that that's not necessary in this

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,490
room but it's an important component of

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,080
what's going on here because it gives us

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,910
kind of this base common framework to

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,710
work against instead of you know company

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,820
a using their framework Company B using

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,990
their framework and then it doesn't

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,100
matter how open-source you are there's

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,460
no way you're gonna talk to each other

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,170
and so Ross is really an important and

00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,220
important piece here so we spend a

00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,810
little while kind of doing what we

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,130
called a concept definition making sure

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,720
that this is actually a feasible project

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,980
that is you know that is going to work

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,270
in the first place because if we're

00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,430
gonna spend time and effort and money on

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,840
this we want to make sure that this is

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,720
actually going to be accepted not only

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,580
by our government clients but also by

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,810
the industry itself and so we spend a

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,099
little while kind of figuring out what

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,110
we wanted to do what we're going to do

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,270
what would be most useful and then how

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:42,240
maybe we could do it within this context

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,730
that I've talked about in before and

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,030
then we spent a year asking people a lot

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,710
of questions we wandered into the the

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,330
military industrial community the

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,980
robotics community and we talked to

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,779
everybody we

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,040
got our hands on across the US

00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,570
government not just within the military

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,000
but reaching out to other organizations

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:01,370
like NASA that's been here this morning

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,449
and and talking to them about you know

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,889
what would be useful and how would this

00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:05,630
work talking to industry partners and

00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,949
saying hey how could this work you know

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,660
understanding that you have your own

00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:10,190
intellectual property considerations and

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,560
and your proprietary software

00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,240
considerations and frankly you know your

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,730
profit considerations which is something

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,519
that we're very aware of obviously even

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,130
you know despite our nonprofit status

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:24,199
and we we got some answers

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,639
so at the beginning of this year we put

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:27,620
together what we called a prototype

00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:31,339
which is basically just throwing

00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:34,250
together the a proof of concept for

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:36,560
everything that we've done so far and I

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,510
realized that this is a conference where

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,850
a lot of what we talk about is kind of

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,740
software based sometimes it's hardware

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,449
based but what I'm about to talk about

00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,610
is going to be a little bit more process

00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:48,410
based because it turns out that the hard

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,810
part about building automated vehicles

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:52,430
for the military is not actually the

00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,709
automated vehicles despite that those

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,420
are incredibly challenging and we still

00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,130
haven't solved most of the issues going

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,079
on there there are lots there's lots to

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,389
go it turns out that the hard part is

00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:04,069
everything else and so I'm gonna talk a

00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,829
little bit about what's going on there

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:09,350
we start with this this thing the

00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,649
infrastructure that we needed to put

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,660
together for this so if you're going to

00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,920
figure out you know this is you're gonna

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,510
figure out how much salsa you've got

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,769
left you need to make a list of all the

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,120
salsas that you have if you're gonna

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,279
figure out what robotics capabilities

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,870
you have available in your arsenal to

00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,699
bring to bear against a new application

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,410
or a new mission you need to make a list

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:28,579
of them we call this list a registry

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,620
partly because it sounds a little bit

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,690
fancy and partly because this is heavily

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:38,750
metadata rich repository of information

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,120
this is a place where we want to gather

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,440
as much as we can about each of the

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,870
robotics projects each of the robotics

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,120
packages that are available and then

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,110
present that to the end users now this

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,240
presents a little bit of a challenge

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,649
because in large part we kind of don't

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,300
want to tell anybody else what we have

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:54,529
available because we are afraid that

00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,430
they are going to go take it and they're

00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,569
gonna build it themselves and then

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,209
they're gonna sell it to our clients

00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:01,010
instead of us and by we I mean everybody

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,500
in the industry right so this is a

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,970
little bit a challenge to begin with but

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,579
we have we've made

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,990
start on it we've built some

00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:11,240
infrastructures and back-end we've taken

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,980
a lot of cues from Ross index we really

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,810
appreciate a lot of hints from there

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,430
that what was gonna be useful here

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,410
unfortunately we've then hidden this

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,540
behind some authentication requirements

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,790
because of course we are u.s. military

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,490
and so we can't unfortunately cannot

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,350
just open this up to the whole world but

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,060
we've built this this registry the

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,949
repository is kind of an interesting

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,670
example we wanted to make this like Roth

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:36,079
is federated sometimes you are willing

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,459
to open-source your contributions

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,930
sometimes you want to say yeah everybody

00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,300
can use this sometimes you want to keep

00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,829
that in-house but even if you do want to

00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,529
keep it in-house because this is your

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:47,600
your secret sauce this is your you know

00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:49,459
your competitive advantage we need to

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,930
know about it we in Rossum need to know

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,939
about it so that we can go in and

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,509
contact you and like since your software

00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:57,889
for our new application so in those

00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:59,089
cases of course we want you to host it

00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,259
wherever you want to host it but if you

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,600
don't if you've got somewhere else that

00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,639
you want to what software to be hosted

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,689
that is not necessarily public but its

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,870
public to this certain group of people

00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,860
we've got a repository set up on some

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,500
government infrastructure and then

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,300
finally the metadata here is like I said

00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,920
this is a rich trove of information

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,559
about each of these packages talking

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,240
about what it works and how it works but

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,459
also as we've heard a little bit before

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,480
about testing and certification this is

00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,459
very important in safety critical

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,139
applications like automated vehicles and

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,870
especially in military automated view

00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,459
vehicles where the whole point of taking

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,559
the soldiers out of the car in the first

00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,180
place is to protect them from danger we

00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:37,399
don't want the car putting them into

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,930
danger itself so safety is an important

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,879
important aspect here and the metadata

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,259
helps us understand exactly what kind of

00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,360
certification process everything has

00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,569
gone through and then we said well we've

00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,339
got to actually try it right so we took

00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:51,559
one of one of Southwest resources path

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,930
planners this is maverick this is a an R

00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,430
R T star based path planner that had an

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,439
I Ross paper last year if you want to go

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:02,240
know more about it it's super super fast

00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:03,860
and we converted it into Ross - that was

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,839
a little bit harder in January then I

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,649
expect it will be in December but we

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,290
went ahead and did it

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:11,959
and then we integrated it into our TK

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,490
and we put you know all of our whatever

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,870
it is to hundreds on packages together

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:18,520
on a hybrid Ross one Ross - system and

00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,620
automated vehicle around so it turns out

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,860
as we've seen already today that hybrid

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,120
Rosslyn Ross two systems work just fine

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,010
which is really nice for us because we

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,570
didn't have to do the entire vehicle and

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,190
then I wrote formations up here there

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,529
was another company that that worked

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,970
with us during this that also took some

00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,990
code and converted it to Ross too so I

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,580
don't want to say you know this is just

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,410
Southwest Research researches thing this

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,610
is as collaborative as we can make it

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,310
and as open as we can make it within

00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:44,260
this context another piece that we

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,460
wanted to a little to kind of focus on

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,960
that's very relevant to pretty much

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,060
everybody but especially to the military

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,529
is cyber security we're not gonna solve

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,330
cyber security ourselves you guys have

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,370
seen a lots of presentations already

00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,190
today about security within Ross to

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,690
using DDS Ross M requires Ross to by the

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,910
way to be listed in the registry this is

00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,370
a requirement for us largely because of

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,750
the DDS capabilities and what we can get

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,940
out of that that's not available in Ross

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,200
one but because we're not gonna solve

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,570
this ourselves what we want to provide

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,940
is kind of kind of a bottom level kind

00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,980
of a full a floor on how much we're

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,900
gonna get out of out of all these these

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,210
software components to make sure that

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,430
everybody is following a list of best

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,620
practices so that every piece of

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,390
software is as good as we can make it

00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,709
and then at some point of course you

00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,240
have to put in the effort to really get

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,500
it tested and certified and all of that

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,810
sort of thing but we want to make sure

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,670
that everybody has some base level of

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,230
capability and then finally and here's

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,310
the hard part so all that kind of sounds

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,050
hard to me or at least having

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,029
experienced it and done it it was very

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,290
hard this part is actually a thousand

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:43,150
times harder than all the rest of it

00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,790
this is the business aspect of Ross Sam

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,500
and this is figuring out how all of this

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,890
is going to play out in the context of

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,000
lawyers and it turns out that

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,770
intellectual property is hard enough

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,560
when you're not dealing with a

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,000
government when you involve a government

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,230
intellectual property becomes incredibly

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,029
challenging contracting becomes

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,700
incredibly challenging lots of things

00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,010
that are relatively easy or at least

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,930
simpler in some contexts become more

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,029
challenging well that's not a really

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,040
good recipe for adoption of something

00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:14,410
that people don't really want to adopt

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,820
in the first place and so what we wanted

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,200
to put together and what we have put

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,720
together is what we call a business

00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,360
guide which is this is how you can

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,740
incorporate Rossum into your application

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,600
this is how this can work

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,100
in a context where you're used to buying

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,930
a complete package a complete vehicle

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,300
complete piece of software and having it

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,310
delivered to you you know

00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,160
wrapped up with a bow this is how Rossum

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,570
which looks like open-source and and in

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,850
fact within the government context will

00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,980
be largely open-source this is how it

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,570
can work out in your in your and your

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,760
field in your mission and so we put

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,590
education up there as well because as

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm sure a lot of you who work for

00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:52,180
larger corporations know working on

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,040
working internally on adopting

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,210
open-source philosophies on being able

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,430
to open source software that you've

00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,990
worked on yourself is not always just a

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,550
check box a lot of times it's an uphill

00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,800
slog and this is something that we want

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,540
to help people do we want to be part of

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,390
that process so that we can bring some

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,740
resources to bear for folks who who

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:11,440
perhaps don't don't have all those

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,720
resources for themselves so this is what

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,820
we've put together so far and I wanted

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,650
to talk to you all about it because Ross

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,200
has of course been crucial to this but I

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:23,620
personally really appreciate a lot of

00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,910
the niche groups within Ross that that

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,650
have kind of paved the way for things

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,120
that that Ross and looks like Ross

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,180
industrial was it was a huge inspiration

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,980
for us taking the idea of these

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,230
commercial robotics manufacturers who

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,780
again generally in their context were

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,180
not really big on sharing and managed to

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,550
figure out a way to drive them towards

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,530
the open source philosophy and we really

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,740
loved that and we wanted to share that

00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:51,160
we are doing the same thing in a wildly

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,810
different arena and and so far it's

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,589
going very well and we're pretty excited

00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,180
about it so here's the final piece of it

00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,410
expansion so I talked about defining the

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,089
concept figuring out what we're doing

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,060
building our you know spreadsheet of

00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:05,260
salsas stakeholder input was you know

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,579
asking a bunch of questions initial

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,370
prototype is what we just did just

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:11,829
recently and then what are we doing so

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,900
in in classic you know open source form

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,550
we really want to push this as far as we

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,160
possibly can we really want this to be

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,870
across the US military and if we can

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,939
across the US government this is

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,199
something that is applicable in a lot of

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,490
arenas that are not just military

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,770
applications we've seen nuclear

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,910
applications already for example and you

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,970
can imagine why governments might be

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,650
interested in those and so this is

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,690
something that we want to to open up as

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,010
far as we can we already have a lot of

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,740
partners on board through various

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,690
consortium open robotics has been on

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,310
board from the very beginning and of

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,629
course that's a lot of connections into

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,549
a lot of folks but

00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,200
if this is something that that applies

00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:49,600
to you and you want to learn more about

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,399
what's going on I'm here obviously today

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,379
and tomorrow and I'll be at I Ross all

00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,909
week next week and I'll be happy to

00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:56,259
chitchat with y'all

00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,179
if you won't be at any of those things

00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,859
here's an email address and I'd love to

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:02,019
talk a little bit more about it here is

00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:04,059
our lovely Rossum logo which is

00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:06,519
apparently cut off on yellow screens but

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:08,320
on my screen it looks really nice it has

00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,109
actually you know three full circles at

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,249
the top and of course the email address

00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:16,749
is also cut off so that's really

00:18:12,249 --> 00:18:18,700
exciting as well but anyway I guess I

00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:20,019
guess you should just come find me with

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:27,269
that I'm done I'll be happy to take any

00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:31,690
questions Thank You Jerry

00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:38,379
all right have a question yeah hi Jerry

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:41,259
so salsa aside as a non-us citizen why

00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:46,559
should the global community contribute

00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:49,629
or in any way support Ross M there was

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,470
no discussion in this talk at all about

00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:56,229
that and your logo has a pentagon in the

00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:00,820
middle which is basically one of the

00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:02,820
symbols of US military supremacy yeah so

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,900
the question about what

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,920
[Applause]

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,890
what's the interest of the global Roth

00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,110
community here I think there are two

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,120
first I want to be very clear yeah this

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,290
is a US military centric which means

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,160
that it is going to be US citizen

00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:24,070
centric so there's certainly no no two

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:28,110
ways about that but here's here's a

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:31,240
couple of ways one is I think that the

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:34,570
philosophy here this idea of bringing

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,120
kind of robotics to the masses is one

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,090
that has a lot of traction in a lot of

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,880
different application areas some of them

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,050
are applicable to only certain

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,760
industries some of them are applicable

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,920
to only certain people

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,330
this one is applicable to actually quite

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,800
a broad swath of industry and quite a

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,780
broad swath of people unfortunately

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,260
they're just all based inside the United

00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,520
States and so I don't think that that's

00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,950
a small community I think it's pretty

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,360
large community that for which this is a

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,370
valuable project the other one is that I

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,200
think it's useful to know where Ross is

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,270
being used I think it's pretty cool for

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,670
me to come to Ross cons to see things

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,020
online to find out applications of Ross

00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,250
that I frankly never would have thought

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,460
about that I wouldn't have been exposed

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:21,070
to in any other way and so this is this

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,810
is an opportunity at least for us to say

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,250
hey here's another another application

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,300
area here's somewhere that Ross is being

00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,540
used that maybe you didn't know about

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,820
maybe he's interesting to you Thank You

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:35,070
Jerry interested of time we're gonna

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,070
