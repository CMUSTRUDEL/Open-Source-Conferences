thank you good afternoon my name is

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,000
Aaron Griffiths I'm from the University

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,880
of Manchester I'm here to talk about

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,740
karma nuclear inspection robots this is

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,230
just one of our fancy buildings up in

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,429
the north of England and these are the

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,160
people that are associated with the

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,900
group the presentation is going to be

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,070
quick short sharp and sweet so I'm just

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,460
going to talk about challenges in the

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,279
nuclear industry of karma 1 comma 2 and

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,490
our Ross contributions these are just a

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,689
list of all our partners and we're up at

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,700
the top there using University of

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,100
Manchester and you can see we have some

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,649
international partners as well so if I

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,899
get straight on to it the what is a

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,000
challenge in the nuclear environment so

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,370
in the north of England there is a place

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,219
called sellafield if you've heard of it

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,920
it's the bottom corner picture there

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,100
it's a large industrial site about 700

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,670
acres it has over 2,000 buildings and

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,949
believe these buildings are active in

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,300
nuclear and you can see that the various

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,219
challenges they have in sight is they

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,809
have to cover this ground there's all

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,460
this floor space they have to cover so

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,720
at the moment they're using human

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,270
operators to do this and they're

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,400
scanning manually to do this so we

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,530
thought as main leave you would think oh

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,900
why don't we build a robot so we decided

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,350
to build a robot and as you can see it's

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,689
based on the turbot - we took some

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,009
industrial standard radiometric tools

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,530
and we integrated it into the Ross

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,049
framework we attached the lidar on top

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,090
and then we started to do some basic

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,720
radiometric mapping in two dimensional

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,200
space and carville one was pretty much a

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,360
success it develops a maps for the

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,310
people into two-dimensional violence as

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,470
you can see each of the green points is

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,680
what the dose rate expected there and

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,270
the red is weight found radiation this

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,530
is such a success that we actually

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,329
deployed it onto the sella field site

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,369
which they were very pleased about so

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,040
they gave us a bit more money and we've

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,280
now developed Karma to using a clear

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,280
path jackal so shout out a clear path we

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,219
use better sensors how kurios so on and

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,560
so forth just a quick video of karma

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,560
which it starts

00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:15,090
so this is just a fairly quick video

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,340
just to show you in action it's not

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,390
groundbreaking in any sort of way it's

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:25,080
just as routine flam and then just goes

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,830
around in various space to produce a

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,830
two-dimensional map so this is in our

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,060
site of in Cumbria and what they

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,819
actually like about it is that it

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,590
produces these individual points on a

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,510
two-dimensional space at the moment the

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,360
nucleons three hand draws most of their

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,880
radiometric maps of the Ginn facilities

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,130
so the beauty of this system is that the

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,010
robot produces all this information in

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:53,760
much more accuracy for them and they can

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:57,560
use the dataset to then in their surveys

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,560
and so on sorry about time

00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,009
