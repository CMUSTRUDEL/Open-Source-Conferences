so hello everyone I'm little big der

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,990
Vaart so I'm a colleague from Yana turn

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,330
from before also working at front of IPA

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,450
and I'm gonna present you a 60 minute

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,350
interpreter which is a an extension of

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,119
the swash frameworks so if you're in the

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,850
Ross community from sometimes you

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,070
probably are already on Curtis mash

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,550
which is a great framework to create

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:33,030
that machine but difficult to maintain

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,450
to scare with as you get more states

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,809
inside your state machines and also the

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,149
program is everything Python so it's

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,809
difficult to non PI that user to

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:50,160
actually use the simplicity of smash so

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,850
in order to going forward I've developed

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,170
a sim a sixsome an interpreter so a 6 ml

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:01,770
is a standard used by the World Wide Web

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,920
Consortium and making the conversion

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,760
between this XML standard to smart

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,450
directly automated so actually you can

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,880
use a sixsome editor even a GUI assisted

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,590
editor like the one that present here is

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,170
from QT creator and create us6 your

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,820
smart state machine directly from there

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,159
so you still have to create those mash

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,009
States but once you're smashed ads are

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,170
created you can assemble them and create

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,780
the state machine and weird run it

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,770
directly from the s6 cement center you

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:41,100
can also use some of the S XML tools

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,399
like you data model on entry and own

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,240
exit script and conditions directly in

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:55,200
the 6ml and it will be interpreted smash

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:58,259
so this this 6ml editor and interpreter

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,560
is already used so it has been presented

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,070
last year bit

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,909
for Ares autonomous crew driving

00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:10,429
machines so it's a new version which is

00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:14,030
completely reverted and very focused on

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,770
smash it has been also used in the Ross

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,780
industry our Pekin press demonstrator

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,569
should add the last row sinister

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,150
conferences and it's currently been

00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:26,090
tested and used in the in his last

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:31,310
version at the scalable in the European

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:34,040
funded project terrible 4.0 so where do

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,310
you find it so it's on github and if you

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,970
want also QT smash viewer because it

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,430
should smash viewer is a bit unstable so

00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,650
I've been working on the reworking

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,330
introspection and qgs much it's

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,330
