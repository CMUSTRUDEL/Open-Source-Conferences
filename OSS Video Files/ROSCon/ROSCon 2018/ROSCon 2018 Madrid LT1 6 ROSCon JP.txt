00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,190
sponsors particularly our platinum

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,170
sponsor Sony without a sponsors this

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,579
conference would not have happened we

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,060
had a lot of gold sponsors some names

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,270
you'll see here today as well whoopsies

00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,560
and silver sponsors and so on as well

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,869
and of course OPA Mubarak's who gave us

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,310
a lot of support over the past year lots

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,560
of emails going back and forward saying

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,840
how do we do this what did you do to fix

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,610
this problem and so on and so off and of

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,400
course no conference goes well without a

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,990
small army of volunteers helping to make

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,810
things work out keeping the registration

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,130
just going and so on now I'd like to

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,450
tell you about the three stages of Ross

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,150
con which is the biggest lesson I

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,829
learned from the day when you organize

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,780
the Ross con you go through three stages

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,009
first is interested patient so you've

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,390
got everything set up the chairs all

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:40,770
laid out the exhibitors have come along

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,350
you've got your staff and you're

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,549
wondering what anyone actually turn up

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,079
and then everyone does turn up and you

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,189
get a whole day of continuous mall panic

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,140
as you're trying around trying to fix

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,220
problems but it's all worth it in the

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,210
end because the third stage of Ross

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,030
corners to drinking

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,360
it's all good so some quick stats and we

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,040
ahead just 14.3% of our participants for

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,960
students and the rest of all and

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,490
commercial in some way half of those

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,730
over half actually were engineers

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,350
working on Ross when we took our survey

00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,000
everyone said we did great they loved

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,830
our conference you know we had wonderful

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,210
presentation quality and apparently we

00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,350
were spot on to the presentation links

00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,230
so hopefully we'll get there right this

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,600
time too and when we ask them will you

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,190
participate next time out of hundred or

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,110
five people responded to the survey two

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:28,370
people said no one did giving a very

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,720
long list of complaints like you didn't

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,410
give us discs or place to charge our

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,000
laptops but if you're interested it the

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,650
videos and I and slides will be

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,980
available at the website you see here

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,180
sponsored by Oasis who's also here today

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,380
we're looking at a way of trying to get

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,030
some subtitles up because it isn't

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,640
Japanese apart from Brian and Nicholas's

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,810
talks but we'll see and since it's such

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,400
a great physicist we're going to be

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:52,870
doing it again next year so we weren't

00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,870
hiring but we do want sponsors

00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,319
