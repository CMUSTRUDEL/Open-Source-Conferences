all right good morning my name is Brian

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,040
Gerke from open robotics and it's my

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,040
pleasure to welcome you to Ross con 2018

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:19,410
[Applause]

00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:21,510
so we're back at it again and so I'm

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,000
gonna open it up here and then we'll get

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,980
right into the talks so first of all we

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,590
can't do this without our fantastic

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,199
sponsors as you've seen we've got a

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,719
really great crew of sponsors companies

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,760
large and small from all over the world

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,920
we're at almost 50 companies sponsoring

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
Ross con this year there are lots of

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,640
Records for us with rasca and this year

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,030
and the sponsorship is certainly one of

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,670
them we really can't do this at all

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,809
without their participation so I want to

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,539
say thank you to all of them and

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,370
encourage you to go into the exhibit

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,469
area during the breaks during the lunch

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,360
during the reception and check them out

00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,739
there's a lot of fantastic stuff going

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,359
on there every time that I come here and

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,440
I go see what the what the sponsors are

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,690
actually up to I learn something new

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,350
that they're doing with with all these

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,229
tools this is the group of people who

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,240
are responsible for organizing the event

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,500
and for putting the program together so

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
these are the people that you should

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,799
find here and complain to if you think

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,729
the event is poorly organized or the

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,020
program is of poor quality we we went

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,570
through a program committee process this

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,549
year like we do every year and again in

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,460
in terms of breaking records we had 160

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,560
submissions and our acceptance rate was

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,200
under 25 percent this year so it's it's

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,310
it's actually a fairly selective event

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,390
with a lot of enthusiasm from the

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:43,829
community about participating which is

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,600
fantastic to see we are also for the

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,149
third year running our diversity program

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,250
we believe that increasing the diversity

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,100
of this community is an important goal

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,460
for a lot of reasons and this is the

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,390
group of people who reviewed the

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,259
scholarship applications for the

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,820
diversity program and we had almost 30

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,159
scholars this year who were attending

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,810
Ross Kahn and this program gets its own

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,410
specific sponsorship from the companies

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,120
that you see here and

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,130
we're really really really grateful to

00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,190
those those companies for supporting

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,380
this important program we're doing

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,720
lightning talks as we've done every year

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,040
roschin although this year we are

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
changing it up if you've had the

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,760
experience of waiting in a really long

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,050
line hoping to get a spot for a

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,630
lightning talk you don't have to do that

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,660
this year don't line up anywhere what

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:34,200
you need to do is go to the URL that you

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,760
see on the screen there and register

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,800
electronically and what we're gonna do

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,780
is randomly choose from everybody who's

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,020
signed up and then we'll let you know

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,960
later today so you can sign up from now

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,250
until 11 o'clock this morning that'll be

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,040
the end of the first coffee break and

00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,200
then you'll get a notification by no

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,910
later than 12:30 and then we'll give you

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,280
instructions on where to come to deliver

00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,390
your slides if you're using slides you

00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,920
don't have to of course but if you're

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,570
using slides or videos will give you

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,400
instructions on on how to do that and

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,920
then you'll have to deliver those by the

00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,110
end of lunch and then the lightning talk

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,210
session will start at 20 past three will

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,070
repeat the same process again tomorrow

00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,930
so as we've always done we'll do the

00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:19,650
sign ups on the day so who are we this

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,060
is a little bit of the demographics we

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,850
sold out for our fourth year in a row

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,410
which is exciting will will get a bigger

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,350
we're gonna need a bigger space next

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,880
year we're working on that one of the

00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,220
interesting things is that there's a

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,110
strong geographic influence as we move

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,300
this event around the world so two years

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,800
ago and we did this in Seoul we had

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,780
almost half the participants come in

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
from Asia last year when we did this in

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,750
Vancouver we had over half the

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,070
participants coming from the Americas

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,180
and here you can see that we've got

00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,980
about half the people come in from

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,960
Europe and that's one of the reasons

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,430
that we we move this event around

00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,950
because we really want to involve the

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,240
whole global community you can also see

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,470
that we're the trend that's stayed true

00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,250
for the last couple of years is that

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,800
this is primarily not a student oriented

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,600
event we're really happy to see students

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,190
here and we want to continue to have

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,500
strong participation from the academic

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:14,350
community but we're I think this is just

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,419
evidence of the industry interest in all

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,019
of these platforms is that we're seeing

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:21,500
really strong participation from people

00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:25,190
I mean largely from companies you'll

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,590
hopefully be fed and given great drinks

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,280
while you're here we have coffee breaks

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,500
2 per day and we'll do lunch as well and

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,810
tonight there's a reception and each of

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,699
those events is also supported

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,860
specifically by sponsors so if you see

00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,659
someone with a name badge from one of

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:48,530
those companies raise the glass say

00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:51,169
thanks just logistics your most of who

00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,419
you hear our most of people who can hear

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,880
me are sitting in that Grand Madrid room

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,229
behind you there's an overflow room so

00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,490
if you find that there's no there are no

00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:02,449
seats in here there's another room

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:05,389
on-site where you can go also watch the

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,759
presentations and the exhibit area is

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,690
out that door all the way down at the

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,669
other end that's where you're going to

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,870
find the coffee and snacks during the

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,900
breaks it's also where we'll be doing

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,310
the reception when we get to lunch there

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
are two locations for lunch which are

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,639
located on their noted on the map and

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,349
you can also find maps outside we're not

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,030
doing birds of a feather sessions this

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,370
year last ways we didn't do last year

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,319
but there was a strong interest in

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:32,060
getting groups together who want to meet

00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,039
up and talk about something so this year

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,110
we facilitated that there's a thread on

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,330
this course that you can go check out to

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,300
see what groups have registered interest

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,860
and also you can you can sign up to

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,779
participate in one of those you'll find

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,639
different groups are planning to meet up

00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:49,099
different places here on site either

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,949
during the breaks or during lunch so

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:53,180
please go you know find your specific

00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,020
community there that you're interested

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,560
us by Honeywell and there are the

00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:08,180

recording and archiving all the videos

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,830
so as we've always done with Ross Khan

00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:20,750
we'll be posting the all the material

free after the event you'll see that

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,069

00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,710

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,439
order them we've started a special

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,330
campaign if your colleagues back home

00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,770
