all right hi everyone my name is Ian

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,679
Chen I'm from oka robotics and today I'm

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,540
gonna talk to you about another NASA

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,240
Ames project just one that we

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:21,119
collaborated with NASA Ames is about the

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,400
simulation of the moon in gazebo so what

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,880
more specifically is about simulation of

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,500
a rover on the moon this is a simulation

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,590
environment created for the resource

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,989
prospector project NASA so ago there was

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,510
to send a rover to the polar regions of

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,670
the moon and to find evidence of

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,660
volatile such as hydrogen oxygen and

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,910
water so NASA Johnson Space Center was

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,230
responsible for hardware and the group

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,090
would work to the NASA Ames they're

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,100
responsible for software and that's the

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,710
team who could I collaborated with to

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,629
create a simulation environment so the

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,699
image you see on the right there there's

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,420
a prototype our Q&A is built on top of

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,939
the kerrick's mobile platform it's got

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,880
active suspension hvo can be controlled

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,820
individually and it's got hazard cameras

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,290
all around the mobile platform and

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,000
looking at its wheels in case it gets

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,030
stuck there's also it's not a camera

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,140
looking on the back and on top of the

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,909
rover there's a mast that carries a

00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,259
stereo camera up here a mountain on the

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,290
Pentel platform so I can look around

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,299
while the rover has being driven so for

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,670
this project we created a simulation by

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,549
room to assist driving operations so the

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,189
robot itself is not autonomous as being

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,590
being driven by remote operators on the

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,040
ground so our goal is creating a

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:46,079
simulation environment Ross and gazebo

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,810
Saros is used to emulate the flight

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,720
software and ground software so we're

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,280
not Russ specifically Ross too would be

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,540
used in the actual system was there a

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,219
topic of the discussion back then on the

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,320
gazebo side of things so the simulated

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,299
vehicle is the my icing on the bottom

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,280
right so it's a simplified version of

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,700
the actual rover but scale to fit the

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,920
dimensions and

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,709
mass of the extra robber is there so egg

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,780
only using passive suspension as opposed

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,340
to active and that was fine for the

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,230
driving experience they were doing at

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,900
the time so since we are simulating the

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,810
moon let's take a look at what it looks

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:32,069
like so this is a video footage from

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,230
Apollo 16 mission as a mission where

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,569
they landed at the lunar Highlands of

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,890
the Moon so there are two types of

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,090
regions that are in the highlands in de

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,140
Luna Maria so here in the highlands is

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,989
you can see the service is actually

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,120
brighter in color it's got more craters

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,650
and is also mountainous regions of the

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,640
moon that's opposed to Maria which is

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:57,120
darker region filled with solid by lava

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,849
so what you see here is somewhat similar

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,599
but not exactly the same as the target

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,060
site that we wanted to simulate so at

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,630
the post where the rubber will be

00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,610
deployed is also in the lunar Highlands

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,010
but some differences here so what you

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,810
see in this mission they landed close to

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,299
a fresh crater so they're actually more

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,450
rocks in the same and come here to the

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,280
poles the sun's also a bit higher in the

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,380
sky so you don't see it here but these

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,590
are too small important differences that

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,590
we eventually had to capture in

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,590
simulation

00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:48,659
so compared to the projects that we've

00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:50,909
done in the past this particular project

00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,290
we focus a bit on visual simulation so

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:53,790
we also did other things I'm modeling

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,200
the vehicle dynamics but in this

00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,269
presentation I'll focus on the

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,370
environment so the image is produced by

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,379
simulation are important and this

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,180
project they wanted to be as realistic

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:08,730
as possible because that's what the

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,480
operators rely on when they control the

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,060
robots and move them around so we're not

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,250
something that we see on the left there

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,350
there's an image produced by gazebo and

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,740
for comparison we have an image from a

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,720
different mission from Apollo 12 so I

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,360
think in general we're satisfied with

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,400
the results there are always things that

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,530
we can improve them and tweak even more

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,130
time but after all this presentation

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:40,800
we'll show you how we created the same

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:43,860
they you see on the left there so early

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,090
on the project we're given a very

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,300
high-resolution

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,490
terrain file so in the form of digital

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,240
elevation maps is a format that sorry

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:55,740
supported by gazebo so what the

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,710
engineers and scientists and NASA did

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,050
was that they took the actual lunar DM

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:04,740
file and then artificially increases

00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,729
resolution and the inserted rocks and

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,010
trailers to make it as close as possible

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:12,930
to the actual site and they were

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,960
simulating so we have this really high

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,710
resolution the in file it's roughly 4

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,539
centimeter resolution so that's adequate

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,760
to simulate the obstacles that you find

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,770
what's the service of the moon and that

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,860
we did rocks and the tiny little craters

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,900
so with this high resolution DM file

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,780
which I when we try to load it in gazebo

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,120
or the first time it took over 5 minutes

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,669
to load and then once it's loaded the

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,410
framework was really bad especially when

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,699
we tried to run it run it on low in

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,750
laptops it was basically unusable so we

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,719
know that at the beginning of the

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,460
simulation we we want to the project we

00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:52,670
want to

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,930
improve performance especially related

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:58,880
to rendering height maps in gazebo so we

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,390
did three things the first thing is that

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,940
we we added the ability to catch terrain

00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:08,390
tiles so we found that a lot of time is

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,980
spent on loading a gazebo start

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,930
uploading a theme flowers on this

00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,600
parsing develop file and creating the

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,640
internal terrain tiles format that we

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,730
use in the underlying rendering engine

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,890
dogger so assuming the daemon stone

00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,660
changed the texture stones change we

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,220
could just reuse the same tiles we don't

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,440
have to regenerate them again so in

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,510
subsequent we only have to do is once in

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,150
subsequent loads we were going to get

00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,360
down the time from five minutes to

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:40,550
roughly thirty seconds so it was a nice

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:42,500
improvement by a factor of ten and so

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,510
the next thing we did was that we

00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,250
enabled level details and it's just best

00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,890
described by the picture on the top

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,380
right so the low frame rate was

00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,690
attributed by the number of vertices and

00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,290
triangles that you see when we zoom all

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,490
the way out we see the entire terrain

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,830
basically there's two main triangles and

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,250
then we can render and all so we maybe

00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,660
level details so it's a quadtree

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,850
implementation of the terrain basically

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,880
the nodes can transition to a lower

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:13,910
level based on camera distance and also

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,630
the high characteristics of the node in

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:20,170
the tree so we see in the animation when

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,610
you zoom out we have reduced number of

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,770
triangles and we were able to render it

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,440
properly around forty fifty frames per

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:33,020
second and the last thing that we did

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,090
was that we decided that for any of the

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,370
terrain that the Rovers and being driven

00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,550
on we don't need high-resolution terrain

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,040
so anything else though in seeing the

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,660
bottom picture there so the bottom right

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,240
we use high resolution TEM and

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,130
everything outside of it we just use

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,010
coarse meshes so as these are Colada

00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,320
meshes and then we build six layers out

00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,700
all the way out to the horizon so with

00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,050
the would be all these changes we're

00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:02,319
able to

00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:04,900
the entire terrain in gazebo the next

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,440
thing that we do is we focus on creating

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,759
the luminaire appearance so the default

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,639
shading model in gazebo just wasn't

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,919
sufficient for the purpose of this

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,050
project so the way I use something

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:18,990
what's known as the Hat key model so

00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,159
it's designed to capture the unique

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,680
reflected properties of the lunar

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,949
surface it's covered by regolith which

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,379
is powdery dust and loose rocks that you

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:33,399
find over the moon the surface of the

00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:35,890
Moon so to do that we what we did is we

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,399
just worked with them to integrate their

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:41,289
own custom shaders to gazebo I want to

00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,779
know that we've seen this people doing

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,630
this in the community already people

00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:48,310
create ocean waves for maritime robotics

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:52,899
applications with their own shaders

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,209
maybe you see in the in talks this

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,510
conference but that was pretty cool so

00:08:55,209 --> 00:09:01,390
for this project we help them integrate

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:04,209
shaders specifically to for high Maps

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,829
and that wasn't possible before so now

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:07,829
it's available in kizhi was 7 and above

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,709
so just a little bit more details about

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,930
the components inside of the shaders for

00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,149
those interested so using the same

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,270
software that they did to generate the

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:24,730
high-risk terrain they were also able to

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:27,040
generate various maps so the top layer

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,810
there you have the normal maps and which

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,000
gives it nice detail and I even look and

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,760
feel of the surface you have the

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,529
pre-rendered shadows we assume that the

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,199
sun's position relative to the moon

00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,630
stage Realty fix over the duration of

00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:46,120
each simulation session so we can use

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,040
static shadows for the terrain but they

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,140
also be able to access the real-time

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,510
shadows that we set up I'll touch on

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,310
this topic the later but these are the

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,649
shadows for associated with the rover

00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:59,829
and then you have the standard alb you

00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:01,420
know the views matt and rach masks for

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,990
the albedo maps you can see that the

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,570
lighter colors are are are fresh craters

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,090
you can see the splash rays from the

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,700
impact

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,220
and they can also apply their home

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:16,870
shading model the happy model to produce

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,870
the image on the right

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,910
so going one step further we work with

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,970
them to create gazebo pelicans that

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,010
interact with their shaders so just have

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,260
a couple of interesting examples to show

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,860
here so the one on the left's that will

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,590
attract plugin so we attract so

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,330
important so the room operators would

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,500
like to know where the robots painting

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,980
is they want to see tracks

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,470
I mean drunk so what we did there or is

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,530
there in that plugin we sample positions

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,660
of the wheels and over time as the robot

00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,580
moves around the environment and then we

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:59,780
draw them on top of a single channel

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,030
texture see on the top here and that

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,220
that texture is I'm dynamically updated

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,990
and I accessible by the shaders and they

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,700
use that to perturb and blend with the

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,160
terrain almost to get the look and feel

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,660
of tracks so we have these tracks drawn

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,560
while the robot who is moving around

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,450
environment and the next thing sample

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,610
there is the on the right of the camera

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:25,310
exposure plugin so there we on the polar

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,290
regions of moon you have situations we

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,790
are often the camera points at the sun

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,040
you want to test different camera

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,840
exposure settings so for simplicity we

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,660
expose the ross topic which takes a

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,430
parameter just camera exposure setting

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:45,110
and then we pass it down to shaders and

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:47,660
the effects they output accordingly so

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,480
it's mentioned before the sun lighting

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,610
is is very important so this typically

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,860
the sun is only a few degrees above the

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,340
horizon so you get a situation where the

00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,800
camera points or looks at the sun quite

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,710
a bit and i wanted to get this strongly

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,680
and we want to model these effects so we

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,510
added lens flares to gazebo

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,050
it's basically a sense a plugin that you

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:13,730
can attach to any of the cameras we look

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,690
for the first erection like in the world

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,260
and

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,700
or put the effect there so it's just a

00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,560
post-processing effect like the ones you

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,300
see in games it's not physically based

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,860
so what that means is basically you have

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:28,700
an image and then you just overlay the

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,550
effect on top of it but it works well

00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,710
with worked with wide angle cameras -

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,750
they're using Y income Y angle cameras

00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:39,610
but it has the cameras so you see on the

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,350
bottom right there we also do a

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,000
occlusion checking so basically we shoot

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,550
out rays from the cameras here with

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,770
their light sources and we look at how

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,690
many rays are occluded and then we scale

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,700
the effects accordingly to give an

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,130
illusion that is being occluded and

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,810
that's important because the rover will

00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,670
be driven into large craters they're

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,200
also distant terrains that will cool the

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:06,290
Sun so you don't want that to shine

00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:12,110
through the terrain and also the last

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:14,360
thing that we did with shadows so in

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,890
general the quality of shadows in gazebo

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,360
was just poor quality before and it's

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,780
something that I would spend a little

00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,980
time on at the end of the project so

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,800
when you have a situation where the

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,500
camera direction is coincident with the

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,900
direction these walking effects on the

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,480
camera shadows that maps ever been

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,750
generated and we get these jagged edges

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,870
that you see on the middle image on the

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,420
top so what and what's even worse is

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,210
that the the algorithm we use to smooth

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,850
the shadows wasn't good at preserving

00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,600
small features so when you have shadows

00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:56,890
as small or rip for something that's

00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:01,490
long and then like the mask on top of

00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,990
the rover previously you would had a lot

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,860
of cracks and made it look like it's

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,770
disconnected

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,870
so that was bad so we made several

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,700
improvements basically we change the way

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,100
we tweaked the way we did shadow map

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,310
generation we includes the shadow

00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,440
texture resolution as well and then we

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:20,540
also change the way we we render and

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,410
smooth the shadows which is general

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,780
faster and

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,250
there's a much better job at preserving

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,920
these small features so you get this

00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:38,730
nice shop crisp shadows that you see on

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:41,150
the bottom so to finish off let me play

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,150
a video

00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:56,440
so we'll show you a big video of the end

00:14:52,030 --> 00:15:00,670
result so this is the same rendered by

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,340
gazebo this is view taken from one of

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,590
the stereo cameras mounted on top of the

00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,220
rover so right now the rover is just

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:13,030
being driven mainly and also the pintle

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:16,330
is also controlled manually so see the

00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:18,160
terrains in these are diems that are

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,000
close by in the distance one are just

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,000
coarse meshes you see on the top there

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,160
is the lens flare effect every place

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,010
where the Sun is and robot is moving use

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,700
as kind of bumpy of the high-resolution

00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:39,640
DMS so here what you see that's slowly

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:45,220
coming into view on livia the shadows

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:48,460
but here you see the the wheel tracks

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,690
they are being drawn as the robot moves

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,690
around the environment

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,510
all right

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,830
oops last year

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,050
[Music]

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:32,800
okay so the last thing I want to show is

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:35,670
that we how we had were close to an to

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,590
the end simulation of their operation so

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,990
so the data were produced by seaman by

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,870
gazebo and simulation was published up

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,880
at Ross and over another bridge onto

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,120
their software so this is and one of the

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,490
tools they used by the members in the

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,320
grounding to monitor robots so for

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,010
example you have the image can't produce

00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:00,160
by gazebo into their software on the top

00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:03,340
you also have a data of the pose of the

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,990
robot in their Traverse City map so we

00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:13,900
almost had an to end simulation working

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:18,160
and and that's it so I'm gonna thank

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,920
everyone involved we're gonna stink the

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,710
NASA Ames intelligent robotics group so

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,620
they're we're feeling a lot of these

00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:30,160
that you see here on these features bug

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:33,100
fixes we think we were able to integrate

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,080
them back to get zero seven so a lot of

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,910
these plugins like the history of

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,110
plugins the height map they were

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,180
detailed plugins they're all available

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:43,240
and has been released

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,280
Ori that you can really use some parts

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,410
are not available it's like for example

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,540
the high resolution DM and their shaders

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,550
I know it's a very complicated process

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,420
for them to get approved and released to

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:57,130
the public so that may take some time

00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,170
but a lot of the improvements having

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:01,660
merging to conceive a serum which uses

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:05,770
the target version that were you were

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,210
using with Ross kinetic and that's it

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:17,099
thank you

00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:17,099
[Applause]

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,919
so the question was the result

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,529
interesting using synthetic cameras

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,049
generate new content cameras for cars

00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:52,620
for driving operations and the stuff

00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:56,309
that we did here are they available so I

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:59,730
would say in general like we made

00:18:56,309 --> 00:19:02,519
several improvements to on performance

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,460
shadows those are already integrating

00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,080
kizhi robot so a large part of the

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,419
appearance comes from the shaders and

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,700
but that's very application specific is

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:15,629
used to capture the reflected properties

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,299
of the server lunar service so I don't

00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:20,370
think that would help for driving

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,070
operations but what I mentioned that

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:25,350
we're working on the next version of a

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,840
rendering engine which is based on

00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:32,730
physically based rendering techniques so

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,980
hopefully that will help them how are

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,480
you dealing with the physical simulation

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:43,529
of regolith and moving through so on the

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:47,460
physics side we only rehab the high res

00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:49,379
Asian VM so that's both basically we

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,340
have so when we're just doing all these

00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:55,379
tricks to do like have normal Maps and

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,460
also level of details and all that is

00:19:55,379 --> 00:20:01,950
not fighting the physics so physics we

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,110
preserve the high fidelity DM files for

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,299
to simulate all the obstacles for

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,250
physics so does that mean is if they

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,669
could be moving over a solid surface or

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:14,669
was it more like sand it's it's more

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:17,909
like a soft solid surface okay but with

00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:20,870
