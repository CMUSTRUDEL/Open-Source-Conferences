hi I'm a minggu from draw but bear with

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,210
me I'm not really prepared for this

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:16,680
stuff but when your boss asks you to do

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:18,570
it we are located in Shenzhen over here

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,859
our goal is to build a mobile

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,359
manipulator robot general-purpose robot

00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:28,949
mobile manipulator this is our first

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:33,120
prototype we built during the first half

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:38,719
of this year and as you can see the

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,719
picking robot picks up an item through

00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,620
object recognition pose estimation and

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:50,610
grasp planning and motion planning and

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:55,199
it picks up an item and give this to run

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:59,969
the robot a similar idea to the fetch

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:04,910
robotics our goal is to make this kind

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,910
of robot that can be adapted to various

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,070
situation various environment and for

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:17,820
various tasks running out of things to

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:20,520
say so so actually we have a we are as

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,100
you can see there's a lot to improve and

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,530
we need more resources so if you're

00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,259
interested we're hiring so if you go up

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,299
there there's a booth you can as talk

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,979
with our HR and PR we are also

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,860
participating in grasping and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:44,009
manipulation challenge in IRAs in

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:47,930
Daejeon this is this footage is for is

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:53,550
the is our robot between a few of the

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:55,890
manipulation tasks the hand you see

00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,660
right now textures and is built by one

00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:06,030
of our mechanical designer engineer

00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:09,440
it has tactile and angle sensors and it

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,600
has under its under actuated so with

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:36,810
adapt to the shape of the object and

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:38,910
it's easier to control so yeah oh and

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,390
the hand is modular so we can change the

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,570
configuration depending on our need it

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,420
can be a parallel gripper it can be

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,610
three fingers gripper like this we are

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,430
one of our team is also working on multi

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,340
robot system and these are the the

00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:01,010
training sets that we are working on

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,010
