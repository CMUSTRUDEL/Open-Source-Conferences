	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
so the previous talk set a nice preamble

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,900
to my talk which is also about a PC and

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:13,799
so basically you could see in the

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,139
previous video as to then I'm the times

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,080
that the video was sped up was eight

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:22,650
times so this year many teams use deep

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,720
learning about five of the sixteen teams

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:33,059
use deep learning for object recognition

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:37,020
and oh you are not seeing the slides so

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,890
as you can see we had this year 39

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,860
different items so our team used 20,000

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,649
RGB images only RGB images and then 500

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,410
labeled images for training the deep

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,079
neural network we used cafe deep

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,050
learning framework and we had you only

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,370
look once strategy so we took only one

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,250
image and we were able to achieve

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,489
performance of about a recognition

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,519
performance in on 70 milliseconds well

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:07,530
that gave us a lot of speed up and yeah

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,890
it's getting deeper into robotics and

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,619
this was the performance as you can see

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,229
here we had quite some reasonable

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,830
accuracy in the recognition and i will

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:26,250
quickly show you a video which is not

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:28,979
sped up but i get access to it first yes

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,520
so finally the video is there this is

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:36,000
the footage of the first two pics of our

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,310
system and you can see the video is not

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,939
going to run for more than one and a

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,520
half minutes even so this was the first

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,200
and what was also disheartening last

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,360
year to hear from some of the audience's

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,110
was they used to say these things move

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,939
like icebergs but fortunately this year

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,350
I hope that they are not moving like

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,939
icebergs at least they're moving like

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,040
ships maybe next year we have speedboats

00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:05,670
so that was the first pick which was

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,810
also what one has the challenge and now

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,810
the second pick I hope

00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,690
a custom design that we had for the

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,960
gripper so well we were also a little

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,510
fortunate that for some reason the this

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,690
kind of pinch grasp was working only on

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:31,760
that bin and we luckily got the object

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:34,370
in that bin luck favors the brave anyway

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,800
that was a about Amazon picking

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,380
challenge here you can find some

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,040
information and yeah let's go deep

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,040
