hello everyone my name is fanfiction or

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,110
you can call me Frankie I'm a PhD

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,650
student in the robot field autonomy lab

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:17,369
at stevens institute of technology today

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:23,340
i'm happy to announce our total body

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:25,800
exploration package in gross it is based

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,250
on a single to the world equipped with

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,070
the rgv d sensor currently we support

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:37,530
the ross indigo but we were support last

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:39,530
version of rows in the future we use the

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,870
mutual information controller to do the

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:45,420
exploration however evaluating mutual

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,870
information at a single sensing action

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,520
requires extensive dramatic computation

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,129
for example we used the recasting of our

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,430
the robots sensory race into the

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,500
involving occupancy map so only a

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,790
limited number of candidates can be

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:10,770
evaluated for mutual information we

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:13,909
select a some random view sample point

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:18,990
to estimate the mutual information

00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:22,470
wasting action space by Gaussian process

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:27,000
regression compared to calcium process

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:30,869
estimation to the ground truth with only

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,750
20 observations we can have a good

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:37,369
estimation of the ground truth which

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:44,070
consists of nearly 200 of our

00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:47,820
observations here is the video shows our

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,670
package the video is played in 10 m

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,430
speed the access the moving access

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,909
represent the current location of the

00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,869
robot the red boxes represent the 2d

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:04,170
frontiers which is cure of generation of

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,500
candidates viewpoint the blue box us in

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,619
3d he represents the 3d map are captured

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,110
by the robot the green arrow represents

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,180
the candidate that has that

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,520
have been evaluated for mutual

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,460
information the higher and the picker

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,330
green arrow means a more mutual

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:28,050
information in there for every step that

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:32,820
the robot will choose the biggest green

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:35,460
arrow so please feel free to download

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,860
and try it we are glad to hear your

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,860
