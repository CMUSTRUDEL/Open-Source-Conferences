thank you it's good it's great to be

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,820
here again this is dr. Rosen Daschle and

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,900
it's on behalf of all the now free rush

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,599
industrial commercial worldwide so why

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,119
rush industrial soon not everybody might

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,289
be familiar with it in this room but our

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,550
main model is if today robots that today

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,500
robots can do much more than

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,840
pre-programmed motions right so we're

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,820
used to robots doing limited sets or

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,590
pre-programmed motions same task over

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,809
and over but now we have all those

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,390
wonderful capabilities and perception

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,100
than I make trajectory generation so why

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,950
don't we exploit this stuff also in

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,899
industrial robotics so all this stuff

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,300
today as we know is mostly a software

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,550
effort like those advanced capabilities

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,620
are typically implemented in software or

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,350
these more complex setups requires

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,020
so-called we call it plumping better

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,989
plumbing and distributed collaborative

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,809
development across teams of experts in

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,969
different areas central so let's bring

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,880
rust industrial robotics and that's why

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,640
we started this initiative so a very

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,280
very quick look at its history so the

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,470
very first mention actually was in Sudan

00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,240
2011 so you still find out the wiki this

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,670
headline about Southwest Research and

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,020
yes kawa teaming up to use Ross with 10

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,060
men so actually this would make the

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,580
initiative turn 5 not only for I would

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,310
say though the first public de beautÃ©

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,470
was a 2012 at an industrial forum we

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,220
have shown other words here we presented

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,049
it the year after that a consortium the

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,360
Ross and also confirmed North America to

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,820
procreate it it will be launched to

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,100
provide financial and managerial backing

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,369
to the initiative which was followed on

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,740
the following year which was again

00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,930
followed by the counterpart in Europe

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,750
there are industrial consortium Europe

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,880
in a train offer IPA and the two years

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,250
after that so as of this summer the

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,649
initiative is expanding in Asia Pacific

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,990
region thanks to the collaboration with

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,630
our colleagues at a star singapore and

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,670
again this is central because it finally

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,679
provides almost worldwide coverage as

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,080
Morgan said Santa hurts at sandra's

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,290
industrial and it's a good

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,430
but Millington from a start is going to

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,319
tell you more about this in a minute so

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:24,780
again the initiative view and we have

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,160
now a good number of members I'm happy

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,680
to know provide you with an overview of

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,010
who we are like of course we can get

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,230
into details of what everybody does here

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,010
but it's interesting to see that we have

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,260
a healthy mix of what I would call power

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,080
users and system integrators power users

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,330
as in end users of industrial automation

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,920
with some engineering capabilities so

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,470
does those fit together in the same

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,080
category as system integrators as people

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,630
putting together the pieces that are

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,269
available as components and they are

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,209
close to what I call application

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,620
development pain as they they have to

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,430
solve the problem I get to go the last

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,340
mile we have another good share of OMS

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:18,060
so hardware manufacturers mostly or

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,010
starting to see the value of this piece

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,959
of software as something to enhance the

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,940
hardware offering and we have a good

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,730
Cheryl's of research institutes

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,670
universities and government agencies so

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:31,200
again we have the actors close to the

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,299
problem they need better software tools

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,989
and they hopefully need freedom from

00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,760
vendor lock-in Oh yams are starting to

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:40,680
acknowledge increasingly the

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,569
significance of a software technology

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,370
neighbor as we like to call it they want

00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,459
to focus on their core competences which

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:51,239
is typically making hardware so they see

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:54,120
a little sense in going over and each

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,060
their own each making their own version

00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,269
of a software tool kit to sit on top

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,000
other hardware offering and for research

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,730
and government institutions so they say

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,470
that they see the benefit of having a

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,600
common vehicle to market their research

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,319
that is the case for instance at

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,139
Southwest Research from over IPA and our

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,600
folks at a start for government agencies

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:22,530
it's a good way to promote open

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,000
standards and to provide for research

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,230
education research the story

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,180
institutions in education

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,720
provide vendor agnostic education

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,300
industrial robotics so in terms of

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,450
activities so we do both technical and

00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,550
non-technical stuff for the technical so

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,930
what is most immediate is having to

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,000
drive some direct development and

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,270
maintenance to actually use Ross on

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,310
industrial robots but then if you want

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,080
to get close to the application you have

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,510
to develop some capabilities and there

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,460
is some great example of that and the

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,050
focus technical project is especially a

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,240
North American consortium developed

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,130
during the past few years and also

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,950
providing more and more accessible

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,350
training as part of our mission the

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:07,830
non-technical part though is growing

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,810
increasingly in significance and i would

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,300
say that we were particularly inspired

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,840
by last year's Roskin talk by Mike

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,030
Ferguson on how to do open storage

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,730
properly and how to use open source

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,310
software in a good way so best practices

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,050
so how to properly use open source so

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,530
licensing compliance processes

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,500
especially how does it Stan compared to

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,300
current safety regulations so I wanted

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,860
to point out the next version does your

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,510
conference less than a month from now

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,480
which you're going again over these

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,760
topics and also lobbying for public

00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,010
funding to be directed towards open

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,560
source software is another of our

00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,420
activities which is pretty important the

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,360
thing so that taxpayers money is put to

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:54,990
use in a in an open way and something

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,380
that can be reused but now let me hand

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:06,060
it over to my colleague in chunk from a

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:08,510
start okay thank you maker and thank you

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,950
osr form allowing us to speak today so

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,690
wats industrial is expanding in

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,010
asia-pacific so I just want to bear with

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,350
me I'm going to go through a couple

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,900
slides about a RTC who we are and why we

00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:25,490
believe whilst industrial is important

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,140
for this region so air artc advanced we

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,630
manufacturing and technology center is a

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,680
initiative from a star in partnership

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:37,050
with NTU NTU is nan yang technology

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,480
technological university so some key

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,310
things here I'll me

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,350
is to bridge the gap from research to

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,810
industry applications for we

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:48,860
manufacturing and manufacturing for

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:51,020
cross industries so we currently have 42

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,790
industry members we have a great new

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,350
facility which is about three years old

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,100
it's about the 50 million dollar

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:02,000
facility with a lot of great toys and

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,830
robots to play with so what is a RTC and

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,870
what do we do we have five core

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:09,710
technology themes one of these is

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:12,380
robotics and these are 42 industry

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,410
members so the key things to highlight

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,890
he is we work with OEMs MNC so walls

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,950
voice ihi and SKF and osama kinsley we

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:24,590
have to your to supply t to industry

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,350
members so these are our service

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:31,190
providers and tier 3 our SMEs all are

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:32,950
small medium enterprises so what's our

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:36,650
track record so as I mentioned before

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:40,730
we've only we were three years old so at

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:44,690
33 years ago we had six staff now we are

00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:48,050
over 120 staff our floor space increased

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,390
from 125 square meters to send 200

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,090
square meters so we're growing rapidly

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:58,580
and we're looking at expanding our

00:07:53,090 --> 00:08:00,050
manpower to about 200 by next year so

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,270
what did we do and why do we believe

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,850
what industrial is important we created

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,220
a we had a workshop earlier this year it

00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,740
was a two-day workshop hosted by a RT C

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:13,250
and n tu so the first day was in a RTC

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,070
we demonstrated a lab demonstration in

00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:19,220
the artc workshop floor we also had

00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,770
guest speakers Oh srf as well as expert

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,560
users and speakers globally day two was

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:28,130
in NTU and now so showcase their lab

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,350
capabilities as well this is just a

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,450
picture of the event participants so we

00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,070
had a good friday day one and the board

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:38,210
room that we had a no so a couple of the

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,979
lab activities shown below so what was

00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,740
the geographical importance of this

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,960
workshop we had a more than 140

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,220
participants from 12 different countries

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,500
of which 91% was from Asia what is

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,040
surprising is that the majority are

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,230
interested

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,769
during the worst industrial asia-pacific

00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:01,970
consortium of which 68 similar to the

00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:03,860
attendance here in moscone of majorities

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,350
from private sectors so we're seeing a

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,839
move from students and research

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,850
institutes into more industry based and

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,470
more companies interested in using loss

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,029
for inverse industrial applications so

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,040
we would like to start the Ross

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,750
industrial asia-pacific consortium and

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,790
we are going to kick that start this as

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:29,149
of January next year so who are we

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:32,139
targeting the hexagons on the top are

00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:34,850
our arm target members so educators

00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:37,370
nonprofit end-users system integrators

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,589
and technology providers we have lost

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,560
industrial consortium we have the

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:45,560
Singapore a star facility so we have

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,180
about 23 two other sister research

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,370
institutes and we are supported by the

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,519
governments of a government-funded there

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,279
is a non-profit as well so these are the

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,510
four pillars that were aiming to support

00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,540
asia-pacific with collaborative network

00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:01,010
open source community applications

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,380
development so these are focused

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,760
technical projects with members and of

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,760
course a lot of training and workshops

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:13,670
so this is consortium map we have three

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:17,750
in North America we have fun have fun

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:20,240
you have and now artc asia-pacific so

00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,819
we're going global we want to help local

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,010
industry gain access to and influence

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:27,889
strategic vast industrial developments

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:35,810
and also to facilitate industry adoption

00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:38,630
of us so where do we go from here this

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,160
is a RTC's plan we will are building a

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,269
factory of the future testbed in

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,579
Singapore this is a image that we are

00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,980
using at the moment it's um we've got

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:53,110
three production mythology's virtual

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:56,329
factories smart factories and remember

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,130
digital factories so one of the witches

00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:59,870
advanced robotics we would like to use

00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:03,319
Ross in this factory of the future

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,050
testbed that we're building to showcase

00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,940
to the world that

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,560
how fast can be implemented in this

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:13,390
factory of the future concept so please

00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,220
register your interest to become whilst

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:17,920
industrial asia-pacific member today I

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:32,579
would like to introduce you to sean from

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:35,470
once we thank you okay so you know I'm

00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:39,010
we're good all right much better thanks

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:41,170
Brian good job all right so I'm actually

00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,890
really excited about this expansion into

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:48,279
into Asia I think there's a great

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,470
opportunity here and when we started

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,079
Ross industrial so long ago as as

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,459
miracle pointed out we realized that we

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,420
were going to need collaborators around

00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:00,430
the world and if you're familiar with

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,070
Southwest Research and the work that we

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,850
do we really do applied research right

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,769
we take we take what academics and

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,170
universities are coming up with and we

00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,260
figure out how to apply that industries

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,899
problems and so it was very important to

00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,279
us that when we found organizations

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,200
around the world to work on Ross

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,300
industrial that they they have that same

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,240
kind of mission and we found that with

00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:28,959
franja for IPA and we've now found that

00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:32,170
with a RTC in in the asia-pacific region

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,810
so I'm I'm really excited about that you

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,880
know I think this was a great

00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,810
opportunity opportunity to kind of

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,570
announce that so I hope you guys always

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,339
excited about it as I am and I'm an

00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:50,980
engineer so this is about as excited as

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:53,680
I get so they didn't want me to come up

00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:58,600
here and talk about mine but I think

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:02,470
I've lost it now I kill it well that

00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,920
looks close enough alright so in

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,630
addition all that programmatic stuff

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,250
there's there's a whole technical aspect

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,850
to Ross industrial and I didn't want to

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:16,329
lose lose that here so one of the things

00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:19,000
we've done is we're pushing to get other

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:21,220
contributors to join Ross and

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,780
drill and you know being in Asia and I

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,960
kind of our expansion of the consortium

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:29,500
Asia it makes sense to to try and

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,200
recruit technical contributors part of

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,060
that though is if if we're going to

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,190
create the software that we're going to

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,260
deploy in factories we have to be really

00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:40,570
worried about the quality of

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,010
contributions so one of the things we've

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:46,330
done over the past year is just put

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:48,100
together a software process that would

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,730
allow us to take open source

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,860
contributions but do so in in kind of

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:57,520
robust and reliable way see if this

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,790
works I totally screwed that up there we

00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,850
go alright so the first thing we want is

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:07,150
contributors right if we want people to

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,860
contribute though we we have to it has

00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,950
to be interactive right we just can't

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,740
take a contribution from somebody we

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,990
haven't interacted with and enroll that

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,150
into ross industrial and we have

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,340
processes for doing reviews just like

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,470
you know Oh srf does for Ross the raw

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,050
score but what I wanted to point out

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,960
here is that if you're interested in

00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:31,900
contributing to Ross industrial we want

00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,960
you to kind of interact with us I get

00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,060
involved with us early so that we can

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,550
kind of guide you guide you through what

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,350
your contribution might be so we don't

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,210
want to tell you how to develop your

00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,980
code but if you're developing something

00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,010
and you want to contribute it to Ross

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,930
industrial we want to help you do it in

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,980
kind of a standard way in a way that

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:56,080
would allow us to accept it and so this

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,210
may seem like a pain but what I'd like

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,339
to promise anybody who's interested in

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,710
contributing is that doing this will

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:06,030
actually save you work because we'll

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,200
probably do a lot of work for you then

00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:11,260
all right so now that we got

00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,470
contributors and on our software process

00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,390
how do we how do we handle those

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,510
contributions coming in well we use a

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,820
standard kind of pull request review

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,730
process that is kind of standard within

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:28,990
github again there's nothing really knew

00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:31,270
about this Oh srf does this as well but

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,800
essentially when somebody makes a

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,140
contribution to Ross

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,390
industrial it goes through a review

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,380
process we iterate with the contributor

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:43,660
and eventually hopefully it gets

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,730
successfully kind of pulled into ross

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,990
industrial and the contribution is

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:53,890
accepted again we're doing this to to

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,750
basically ensure for our industrial end

00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,490
users that are using ross industrial

00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,350
that even though it's open source

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:04,029
there's these level checks that go on

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,399
and then the other thing I'd like to

00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:08,740
point out is that we we have continuous

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,550
integration tests everybody knows that

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,079
that OS RF if you build devins that this

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,140
will happen on the server's

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,660
automatically but all in Ross industrial

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:23,470
we also created some continuous

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,440
integration tests our software that

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,529
allows us to run on Travis which is kind

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,260
of a cloud-based continuing continuous

00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:34,660
integration platform the cool thing is

00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,760
is all that software that allows us to

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,440
run on travis has been open sourced and

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,959
i think others might find that useful as

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:48,459
well but we find it useful just for

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:50,170
ensuring quality all right so i said the

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:54,730
major thing we were doing is is

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:59,350
recruiting so where this is a pretty

00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:03,209
simple graph right do you have a job if

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:06,459
you do have a job do you like your job

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:09,220
if you don't there's a whole list of

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:13,600
organizations right all ross Industrial

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:15,490
Organizations we're all hiring but I

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,069
don't want to promote that too much what

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,290
we're all good places to work by the way

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,470
all right but if you do have a job and

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:24,970
you like it you know perhaps you work in

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,579
an organization that uses ross

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,870
industrial and you like your job but we

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,929
would still like to invite you to

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,580
contribute right and so you can be a

00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:35,460
member of the ross industrial team

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,350
because we're an open source project

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,790
right so if you have this interest if if

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,250
you really want to contribute to ross

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,550
industrial please come see us at our

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,300
booth out there we actually have kind of

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,360
position

00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,760
for open-source contributors so the

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,430
other half of this graph is if you don't

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,650
have a job and you would like one now

00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:02,620
again we're hiring but if your student

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:05,230
or you know you're just not hobbyist so

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,790
you're not really interested in getting

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,380
a job immediately but you're like you

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,550
know what in the future I'd really like

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,590
to make some connections again I would

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,870
encourage you to contribute there's

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,990
great that's a great way to make those

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,750
connections and if in the future you

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,850
find yourself in need of a job you know

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,830
it might be a lot easier to get one and

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,660
I would say this is true in general not

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,620
just of Ross industrial but if you're

00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,140
going to choose to contribute to

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:37,360
something I would choose Ross industrial

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,940
alright so I'm just going to play the

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:55,050
video in the background but we can take

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:55,050
questions I messed up ok any questions

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:11,620
and none for America over what load the

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,980
what oh oh we're gonna do a birds of a

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,470
feather tomorrow right all right now I

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,120
totally swung this on me birds of a

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,350
feather tomorrow for Ross industrial if

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
you if you're interested to learn more

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:28,560
and more informal if you're too
