good morning all right welcome to ross

00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,900
con 2016 my name is Brett thank you

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,130
thank you my name is Brian gerke I'm the

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,450
CEO of the open-source robotics

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,690
foundation and I'm very happy to have

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,000
all of you here this we are going to

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,439
have a full house so please scoot into

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,300
the middle and make sure we've got we've

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,720
got room for everybody and just as a

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,760
housekeeping note if you did not manage

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,080
to get registered during this morning

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,050
that's okay just come back during the

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,020
coffee break and we will sort that out

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,000
so we couldn't do this without our

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,239
sponsors for whom we're very very

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,129
grateful for their support we've broken

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,750
all kinds of records this year in this

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,340
case both on the number of sponsors and

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,230
in the amount of support that we've

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,480
gotten so thank you very much to our

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,949
sponsors we've got some great exhibits

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,020
just outside of this room which would be

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,760
able to see during the coffee break and

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,190
also during the reception how did we put

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,809
this together it involves a lot of

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,030
people only some of whom i'm going to

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,439
show you here there are more people

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,409
behind the scenes who helped including

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,810
frankly all of you so our organizing

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:15,180
committee this year was my colleague

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,280
Tully Ryan Gariepy from clear path

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,439
myself and Daniel stonier from Eugene

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,130
robot right here in Seoul and then the

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,020
program program committee was that group

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,000
plus Ian McMahan from rethink robotics

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,610
Tom Moore from locust robotics and

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Melanie wives from fetch robotics those

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,810
are the folks who together looked at the

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,460
proposals that you sent in and decided

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,460
which proposals were going to be the

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,380
best fit and the best mix to be

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,850
presented here so if you don't like the

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,450
program you can come bother one of the

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,939
seven of us this year for the first time

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,890
we decided actually sorry one moment uh

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,630
there are also other people who are

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,479
really involved behind the scenes doing

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,420
the organizing my colleague and our CFO

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,549
at OS RF Roberta Friedman and I'll see

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,049
also Carly copra from meat green who is

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,460
here somewhere in the audience they've

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:04,409
done a lot of work behind the scenes

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,429
making sure that this actually happens

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:12,150
seamlessly also this year for the first

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,380
time we've put a specific effort into

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,350
increasing diversity

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,360
among our audience here at ross con and

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,070
so this is an effort that started

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,210
internally at OU srf with some of the

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,000
people you see listed there at the

00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,330
bottom and my colleague and software

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,310
engineer at OS RF deanna hood took the

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,870
lead and as our diversity chair this

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,960
year you'll be hearing from her actually

00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,400
morning presentation today she took the

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,230
lead and organized for the first time

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,600
that we've ever done this a diversity

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,640
scholarship program by way of which we

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,280
were able to support the travel and

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,780
attendance of 16 scholars from around

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,950
the world who are coming from

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,660
underrepresented groups this is

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,160
something that we think is immensely

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,930
important to the tech industry in

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,340
general to the robotics industry more

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,750
specifically into our community in

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,210
particular so we're really happy about

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,740
that and i'm very happy to say that

00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,870
we've spent in rough numbers about ten

00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,430
percent of our conference budget on this

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,780
particular effort so that's that's the

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:09,090
level of importance that it has for us

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:11,100
as always in addition to the main

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,680
program which is posted online and there

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,100
are also signs out front we do lightning

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,530
talks so we do two of these one per day

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,060
the first one will be at ten minutes to

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,430
three this afternoon and the second one

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,990
will be at 20 minutes to three tomorrow

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,520
the way this works and many of you asked

00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,770
to sign up in advance and I said no

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,600
because you can we do this on a

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,490
first-come first-served basis each talk

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,060
is a maximum of three slides three

00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:39,900
minutes this is going to you have to

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,580
find the person whose name is to do to

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,250
whom jÃ¶rgen eight so look for someone

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,310
named to do and give that person your

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,340
slides Kent where's Kent Kent is named

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,140
to do so what you need to do during

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,490
starting during the first coffee break

00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,870
today is fine Kent and get your name in

00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,970
there for a lightning talk it will be

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,800
oversubscribed so I can't guarantee that

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,740
you'll get a slot and be kind to Kent

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,600
don't don't mob him but we'll get in as

00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,860
many as we can and what you'll do is if

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,209
you've got slides you don't have to have

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,920
slides but if you've got slides hand we

00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,000
can't he'll put them on a single

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,350
computer and then we'll present from

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,880
there this afternoon and if you've been

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,770
to this event before watched it you know

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,330
that we're very very strict with the

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,730
timing at a max of three minutes and

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,500
Ryan Garrett people will take no end of

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:26,160
joy in clapping you off the stage if you

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,150
try to run over we also do birds of a

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,130
feather sessions so

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,370
this is a time that we have reserved

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:34,410
each afternoon right after the lightning

00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,870
talks and this is meant to be self

00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,460
organized so as you were lining up for

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,080
registration this morning you may have

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,870
seen a white board that's out in the

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,880
hall behind you the idea is that you

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,410
write down a topic that you think would

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,320
be of enough interest to get a group of

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,580
people anywhere from five to 25 people

00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,139
let's say who might be interested in

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,539
that topic write it down on the

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,680
whiteboard and if you see a topic you're

00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,300
interested in indicate your interest

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,060
there and then what we will do is take

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,760
all that information and we will decide

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,320
which heuristic alee which topics seem

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,750
to have enough interest and then we will

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,490
allocate space in here in the room next

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,250
door and in other places for people to

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:15,539
congregate and discuss in person those

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,310
those particular topics again for this

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,810
you want to sign up before the end of

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,039
lunch today and that's the deadline

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:24,720
that's written on the whiteboard out

00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:26,400
front so how do we do this year like I

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,110
said on sponsorship we broke records in

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,479
on registration we broke records we're

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,080
actually we sold out in advance for the

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,699
second time in two years and so we're at

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,380
an official total of four hundred and

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,490
thirty-seven as of last night I think

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
that number is probably even a little

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,139
bit higher now with some some folks that

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,150
got added in at the last minute I did

00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,310
some early demographics on this and you

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,960
can see that a couple of shifts here one

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,090
is from the first time we did Ross Khan

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,440
we were about fifty fifty student

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,130
non-student now we're starting to see

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,479
more like two thirds non-student I take

00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,310
that as one indication that we're

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,599
starting to see more interest from

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,110
industry which i think is a good thing

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,479
for the community and when we decided to

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,830
do Ross Khan here in Seoul we looked at

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,630
many different options including may be

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,830
doing it in the bay area which is i can

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,990
tell you way more convenient for us

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:14,520
because their offices in california but

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,080
we said you know we've never done this

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,310
event in asia it's important to do that

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,979
and we can see the results right here

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,970
where you know over forty percent of our

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,800
attendees are coming from the

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,570
asia-pacific region which if i were to

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,570
compare this to previous years is a

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,580
massive shift in fact i think that we're

00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,860
almost thirty percent of the people here

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,210
are from korea and that's a that's a

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,530
huge increase over what we would

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,150
normally see some and i'm really happy

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,860
to see that we're really getting to

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,400
connect with our community in a place

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,960
where where we don't normally do that

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,180
a few metrics of how how the Ross

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,699
community is doing and if you want more

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,650
details go to the wiki page there my our

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:54,800
colleague Tilly foot just published our

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,630
latest annual metrics report basically

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,509
everything is you know up into the right

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,770
as they say we're about a hundred and

00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,080
fifty percent increase year over year

00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:06,169
and how many people are downloading Ross

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,580
packages and if you look at where those

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,919
people are coming from what's happened

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,979
over the last year is that China has

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,800
become our number two location for

00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:18,229
people looking at our wiki documentation

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,850
so and and that's that's been a change

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,590
over the last few years China moved up

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,479
past Germany past Japan to become number

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,720
two so we've got a huge amount of

00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,880
interest in Asia and obviously Korea and

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,139
Singapore are up there as well so we're

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,840
really happy to see that as well as

00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,110
Japan if you look at where what distros

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,370
people are using it's a good thing

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,050
they're using the the long term support

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,360
distros so we've still got a majority of

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,130
people by way of at least by measuring

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,840
downloads who are using indigo and we're

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,840
starting to see use come up on kinetic

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:51,650
you may have heard the news a couple of

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,840
weeks ago that we created a new

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,880
organization which is a subsidiary of

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,220
the open-source robotics foundation it's

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,400
a taxable for-profit subsidiary called

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,539
the open-source robotics corporation and

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,039
what we're doing here is following the

00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,470
model that other open source communities

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,330
have done to create a company as opposed

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,010
to a foundation which can more freely

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,099
work with industry and this was really

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,720
done by demand of industry who wanted to

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,870
support what we're doing but because of

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,580
the way that nonprofit tax laws work in

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,409
the United States our hands were really

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,449
tied in terms of working with them even

00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:25,310
doing open-source work so we're really

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,810
excited to have been able to go through

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,599
this reorganization to create this new

00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,610
entity that is going to have a freer

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,800
hand to work with industry to be clear

00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,050
our intent and our goal is still to do

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,279
the open work that you know us for so

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,169
that the goal of creating this

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,150
organization is to be able to get a

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,219
closer connection with industry who are

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,170
starting to use our platform and

00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,170
interest and be able to meet their needs

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,880
I can say that we're we're interested in

00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,470
talking with any of you who are at

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,730
companies who would like to support what

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,670
we're doing and find out what it is that

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,380
you need

00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:01,050
also tell you that we're hiring today we

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,330
have two coffee breaks actually two

00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,740
coffee breaks each day as well as a

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,210
catered lunch the way this is going to

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,430
work as the coffee breaks are in the

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,640
area out behind here as well as in the

00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,650
overflow room to your left and lunch

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,630
will happen in two places when you go to

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,040
lunch most of you should go upstairs to

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,860
the fifth floor there's more space up

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,180
there but also maybe a third hat a

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,740
quarter to a third of people can stay on

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,870
this floor and they'll be lunch in the

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,400
overflow room to your left lunch today

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,520
is sponsored by arm for which we're very

00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,710
thankful we have a reception with food

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,390

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,160
sponsored by Intel for which we're very

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,620
thankful and that will happen in the

00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,830
area again just out behind you and to

your left our Wi-Fi today you've

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,800
probably noticed already it's rasca and

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,870

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,830
sponsored by Bosh we're very grateful to

a bone to slash canonical so there's the

00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,710
the website my understanding is we've

00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,120
got a couple of technical difficulties

00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,920
which I can see being resolved am i

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,410
