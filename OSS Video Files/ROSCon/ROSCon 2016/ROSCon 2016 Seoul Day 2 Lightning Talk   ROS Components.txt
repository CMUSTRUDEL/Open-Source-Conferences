hello everyone I'm Roma Navarro from

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,849
Robotnik in Spain and go into president

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,750
rose component those components is a new

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:16,470
online store focus on robots and

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:23,430
components supported by rose we only

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:28,650
have an unwanted component ruff ruff

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,650
ready component and as you know there

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:37,129
are many robots and sensors available

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:41,280
for us but sometimes it's difficult to

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:45,329
to find the place to buy them the

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,010
sensors mainly so one of the goals of

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:52,410
Ross component is to gather as many

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:57,360
robots ants as and sensors as possible

00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:03,930
in just one one side to make it easier

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,390
for you to find them apart from the

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,080
standard information and technical

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:13,439
information off for every roboter

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,060
component we we want to provide all

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,570
roles related information regarding the

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,770
Rose package compatible supported

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,590
versions tutorial more information

00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:33,119
normally we want to to link to the

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,820
official rose quickly and all the all

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,950
the extra information will be will be

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,549
added to the roast weekly because we

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,540
don't want to duplicate information and

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:48,720
another an important goal of Rose

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,750
component is that we want to contribute

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,509
to the Rose maintenance and development

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,210
and therefore with the open stock

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:03,119
robotic foundation so we are going to

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:06,329
donate part of the sales to the to the

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,599
Rose community just to help so every

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:13,760

to ship worldwide for most of the

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,670
