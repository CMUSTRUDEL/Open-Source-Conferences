okay so hi I'm Steve okay so I wanted to

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,589
feel a little bit upstaged by the

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,469
canonical guys but it's really nice to

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,830
see other people who care about

00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:16,049
configuration and deployment and stuff

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,670
like that so this is I want to talk to

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,029
you about a github projects been working

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:23,760
on for a bit called Laniakea which is a

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,260
set of an ansible roles in playbooks for

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
provisioning ross on to control our

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,380
hosts are pretty automatically it

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,030
addresses a dirty but necessary job that

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,770
I was tired of doing and I know a lot of

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,260
you out there are also tired doing and

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,790
none of us are really very good at it

00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,320
but it just kind of has to be done you

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,950
know eventually to make all this stuff

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,539
happen packages Ross packages drivers

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,730
everything has to get onto our robots

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,309
they have to do it repeatedly I got

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:58,260
tired of doing it and so I want to help

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,870
you and me do it too so far so ansible

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,820
is a deployment provisioning deployment

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,350
and configuration management framework

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,090
really easy to use requires no

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,310
controllers there's no modules to set up

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,350
you don't have to like spec out your

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,420
entire infrastructure decide what you're

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,820
going to you know have on your robot

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,400
ultimately you can just kind of jump

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,490
into it so so far what I have working on

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,950
here is Hardware roles for deploying

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:32,360
Ross installing Ross either via SD card

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:37,100
or hard disk to generic x86 platforms

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:45,570
raspberry pi PI 1 are sorry pi tune pi/3

00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:47,869
Jetson family the up board and i also

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,310
have roles for doing things like

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:54,689
installing real sense installing the zed

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,899
camera all sorts of interesting stuff

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:03,960
like that let me just walk through here

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:06,930
what do I got okay so yeah send me pull

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,539
requests send me bug reports contribute

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,599
to this I started this because like I

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,500
said um I notice a lot of people have to

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,150
do this and

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,700
now that i'm going to start up i have to

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,710
do it too but everybody kind of tends to

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,790
look around they find that nobody's it

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,650
looks like nobody's done it because

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,570
everybody adds their own special sauce

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,790
to things and then it kind of disappears

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,280
inside the organization and nobody

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,000
learns from anybody else's previous work

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,780
so check it out oh and the name really

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,410
quick Lenny ikea is a turtle hatching

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,840
ground in Hawaii so robots Ross Turtles

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,640
yeah you see what I did there I actually

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,640
