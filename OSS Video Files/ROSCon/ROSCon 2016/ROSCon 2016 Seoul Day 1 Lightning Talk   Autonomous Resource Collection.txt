hello everyone my name is Matthew Frick

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,629
I'm from the University of New Mexico

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,750
and Kennedy Space Center NASA wants to

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,460
put astronauts on Mars in 2030 and they

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,580
realize they can to take the resources

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,980
they need to support that so the plan is

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,810
to send swarm robots up first to gather

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,910
resources water ice are just going on

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,310
Mars not too long ago so you have oxygen

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,170
of hydrogen these robots will mine those

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,570
resources and have them waiting for

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,769
astronauts in your life so this provides

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,230
initiative from NASA to develop

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,070
algorithms and robotic technology to

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,860
support this mission what we've done is

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,629
recruited 40 universities in the u.s. to

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,280
come up with algorithms for discovering

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:52,590
resources gathering the resources and

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:54,420
return them to a central location there

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,039
are two missions here one is to create a

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,230
technology support this mission and

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,850
secondly to train people in robotics so

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,280
the next generation of Ross programmers

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:10,320
will be able to contribute to future

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:12,689
missions NASA we provide for free we

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,939
provide hardware to these teams based on

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,189
desert harvester ants that exist in the

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,540
deserts around New Mexico so these ants

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:20,369
are really good at finding these social

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,439
environment and bring them back to

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,530
central location so these robots are

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,040
based on the behavioral reasons that we

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,170
observed in these ants there are two

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,659
competitions one is with real hardware

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,759
and the other is a gazebo simulation so

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,579
teams can enter their algorithms we have

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,869
a virtual competition and we see who can

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,520
gather the most resources in the least

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,320
time and then eventually these mining

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,970
robots that we've developed these are

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,720
low g robots that can be sent to other

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,689
planets the red light they will actually

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,009
carry out these algorithms mine water

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,509
ice and return to central location so to

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,280
find out more about the Swimathon you

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,479
can go to NASA's home alone calm and

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
it's really motivating to be able to see

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,989
students out there as soon as you say

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,340
we're going to other planets they say

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,910
okay

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,910
