okay good hello everyone I'm in some way

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,780
from I'm research fellow in the robot to

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,599
research center at an alien technology

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,100
university in Singapore so I don't know

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:19,740
how many you have reached singapore so

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:23,990
okay some of you so singapore we are in

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,900
a small island with 5.5 million people

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:31,140
but the Singapore government I really

00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:34,730
invest a lot in robotics so we just

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,829
launched the National robots programming

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:44,309
in total ho budget of 500 14 million

00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:48,809
singapore dollars so far behind ginseng

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:52,440
abdallah pair per person so we are ross

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:56,430
user so i'd like to show you a bunch of

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,670
videos to show our involvement in this

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:08,220
community and the first one is actually

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:11,159
is a door on humanoid robots ok this is

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,530
do I'm robot doing a small parts

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,159
assembling what I have to mention is bad

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:20,130
this is done by two final year and the

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,820
creative students so by using words that

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,580
can capable programming a robot in

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:31,079
instruments this is a fantastic job the

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:37,020
second one is actually is is the taping

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:43,170
robot we use Ross industry for doing

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:48,960
taping and and we have our just over

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:51,930
here for me okay so we use driver from

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,380
Ross industry and we can automate Regina

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,820
is the taping trajectory and we have

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:04,049
some really collaboration with aerospace

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:06,689
industries so the third video actually

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:12,010
is our entry in Amazon picking

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:14,319
challenging so we

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,200
and according to Seattle for attending

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,269
this competition and this project is

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,319
combined of vision grasping task

00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:26,379
planning and decision maker so with this

00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,470
project we have attracted a local it

00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:32,470
comes company to collaboration with us

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:40,000
to explore its possibility of for

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:48,670
logistical robots we also made the sound

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:53,700
robots by ourselves this one is the ADA

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:57,519
guy so it's a robe de Zig they can

00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:02,530
imitate your gesture and the facial

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:06,959
recognition if you're not there yeah so

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,959
