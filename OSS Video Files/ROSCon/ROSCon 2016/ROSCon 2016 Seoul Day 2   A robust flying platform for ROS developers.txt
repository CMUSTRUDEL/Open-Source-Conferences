	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
so thank you guys I'm glad to see there

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,469
are still many people left since this

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,929
last station so now let's begin my name

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,630
is Norman and I'm from DJ I'm a system

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,390
architecture engineer and the cape on of

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,930
this presentation is quite simple oh

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:24,060
sorry wait he's an annoying for roast

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,380
they call it a mattress my hangar and I

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,880
want to introduce you guys to join

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,740
because i have to do many of you guys

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,060
and not familiar with it because few

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,790
people from the aerial robotics

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,410
development and I want to prove that the

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,059
joint very powerful so now let's begin

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,000
so first I will talk about how we are

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,070
part to do so technically displaced and

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,200
then tell about so we're apart we have a

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,649
protocol and we package the dose package

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,590
for it we call it unbore SDK and the

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,390
time of share some developers stories to

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,250
prove that the joints very suitable for

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,410
the ghost pepper and it's very powerful

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,309
and then we'll talk about some future

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,229
map so let's begin I believe that many

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,979
focus sitting here have already knowin

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,140
bout DGI or a list here of our some of

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,500
our products like the Phantom like since

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,420
bear and the latest ones medic and we

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,939
also have worked 14 developers weak

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,130
heart mattress mahendra and this joins

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,560
nether framers nor sending well but we

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,200
are keeping we are training her training

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,850
our hard working on it and the

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,310
motivation to build is joined the West

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,500
symbol we received many inquiries before

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,450
we launched the mattress mahendra some

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,340
of the people from the university lab

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,939
tourists or some research institution

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,360
and this is that hi DJ I have some areas

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,430
are related to the navigation or the

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,860
past planning but I don't have a

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,460
platform to test it because I don't want

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,110
to build drawn from the controller to

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,119
beginning of the controller and then

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,799
apply my algorithm I want to use your

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,090
platform I saw your drum and quite good

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,100
so unfortunately at the moment the count

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,229
and the other group people's is that hi

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,689
DJ I'm doing some drawing related

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,940
business such as some power line

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,950
checking so it's a join with camera will

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,840
fly over the power line and you check if

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,640
there are some some wrong way to

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,690
portland OR

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,280
so good so after receives loss of this

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,650
encourage they decide to build a joint

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,860
for drivers so they can build their own

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,440
sins on our platform then we launched

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,980
the mattress 900 and answer them yes of

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,920
course so the mattress 100 has very

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,480
accurate as stable and reliable come

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,850
here with some open source solutions

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,180
because each is very professional in

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,810
Aero photographic system design we use

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,330
our technology in the controller and in

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,130
some smart navigation then will you

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,709
tease maybe this stone for the driver

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,239
and we also have a serial port so the

00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,630
driver second talk to the cereal party

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,450
idly by the raw data and we call it

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,430
ambar SDK we also build a ghost package

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,070
for it i will talk you later and then

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,650
the delicate in pain still his own and

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,769
you see or some bar in Manion system on

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:12,739
a joint we have extra space for actual

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,140
sensors and extra uses and we have a

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:19,100
camera with Kimbo the web person can get

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:22,310
the live video directly it's about h.264

00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,100
format and the last one we have gettin

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,440
system the canyon system is the stereo

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,290
camera and you can get a despair hey the

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,049
taps taps information from the camera

00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,709
tech 32 for your own vision related

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:42,470
algorithm so let's move to the software

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:45,170
part welcome the mrs k 2 first the most

00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,769
basic thing lacking show you can ask

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:50,959
Joan for example 25 forward in five

00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:54,170
meters per second or as to join the fly

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,630
to the east 6 meters and you can get the

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,110
real-time data from the broadcast from

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,910
the mattress mahendra for example what

00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,489
the current velocity the current

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,660
continue and even how many percent of

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,970
battery left and the most important one

00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:15,200
I thing is a data transmission record

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:17,620
the data link you can talk with your s

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,359
know you your nuc or your humble

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,240
computational device can talk with your

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,490
mobile device directly by the data link

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,830
which means you can choose different

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,840
tasks or the

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,389
in functions by pressing the screen of

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,030
your mobile instead of you of some SS

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:38,680
edge or remote desktop by the Wi-Fi or

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:42,280
some pocky very surreal part and the

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,379
range is about five kilometres and the

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,300
last one we have a camera with Kimbo so

00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:49,000
you can get a live video and can choose

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,009
the camera control the camera and to

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,189
make it look at the exact angle and

00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:57,909
position you want we also have a ruse

00:04:54,189 --> 00:05:00,699
package for our amor sdk the reason is

00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:03,250
quite simple because at first the way I

00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:05,560
totally some of the researchers from the

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,930
University to tell me Z don't have too

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,789
much in banning system program backwards

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,550
they are all working on the hello

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:15,099
algorithm design so we thing we need to

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,229
do the most painful part for home that

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:20,440
is talking to the studio part in your

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:22,750
data so there are about six packages we

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,370
provide for the roast users there are

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,500
file lists in the official repository

00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,319
the last one not because of some

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,710
third-party library dependencies issue

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,110
so the most important one is a DJ sticky

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,389
lip package it has nothing to do with

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,419
zeros actually we just put it into the

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,389
catechol space and make it a roast

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:46,330
package it has the it talks to the

00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:50,110
studio project lee with raw data like I

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,020
send 0x a B and Zurich CD for one

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,690
comment and directs dear dear 12 x tier

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,180
2 for another comment and this one to

00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:01,270
this kind of thing and it's a library

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,960
actually so the DJ SDK package is a

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:08,169
translator to translate what DJ SDK

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,719
lived to what DJ SDK lib due to the

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:14,279
roaster language says a top exists to

00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:16,569
serve basis and some action labs and

00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,719
digital map is a package that we

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:22,419
translate a DJ open open SDK protocol

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:24,099
into the mailing protocol so my links

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,159
are very popular in the open source area

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,379
when users working on the John so we

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:32,500
also want to combine the open source

00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:34,300
community with us so we design a package

00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,279
that's translating the mailing protocol

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,510
into our political and our protocol into

00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,380
the meddling protocol

00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:43,660
so the last one the red one station is a

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,060
web page based the quantitation you can

00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:49,210
put your way points on the map maybe the

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,890
google map means a beam map and then to

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,220
join will flash through this bleep

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:57,190
points we use some Africa as a package

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,380
name but it's ross transcript and the

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,230
last one doesn't show in this list it's

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,480
a camera note it reads the h.264 format

00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,540
video from our camera and then publish

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,420
it into the those network so this is the

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:14,520
whole structure forgive my ugly painting

00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:20,440
I and you can see it's layer by layer

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:24,100
okay where's the most okay this one is

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,930
drawn and the drone stairs the serial

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,300
port and the camera port the serial port

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:30,640
will talk to the tea set tjs tequila and

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,010
there is a hardware layer the medium

00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,020
layer and a PP layer because application

00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,360
layer and then the DJ has to give you

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,240
pack all these things into the roast

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,600
language sighs the topics so serviced

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,020
and action action stories so there is a

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:49,120
publisher there is a service service

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,520
server and action observer and we also

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,050
wrapped a header file record the DJ i

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,290
joined the edge I just felt the

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,760
developers can use our code directly

00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:07,750
although they have no experience with

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:10,420
josh is just an opp oops so the question

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,780
is that many people ask me why why did I

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,760
want to write a ghost package for our

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,850
drone the first reason questionable

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,860
because just very popular in DJ actually

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,740
most of our two efforts had experienced

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,290
visitors and we use just at framework to

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,350
code and use loss as the back to test as

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,270
rvs like a table and so we want to

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,330
introduce you just to our drivers and

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,490
the second reason is wishing schedules

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,490
is a universal standard between

00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:41,169
developers and us we are also developers

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,260
so is a universal standard between

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,910
developers and developers so the a

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,890
person as following the same

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,050
communication protocol so they don't

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,950
need to learn about our new embracing a

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,350
protocol

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,090
if they have some experience videos

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,010
performance you can use our package

00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,350
directly and to control our joint

00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,630
actally so to be very concerned so

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,750
developers can play with the topic is

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:07,840
services and actions we provide directly

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:11,590
without caring about how our code works

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,560
with the matrix mahendru so this example

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:17,950
that we isolated and modular different

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,280
packages first the service will send

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,690
some the service client will send some

00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,150
requests to the service handle the

00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,830
handler will judge the callback function

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,840
the carbonation will to find the

00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:33,280
corresponding application layer in the

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,780
library and the library will give it to

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,580
the medium mayor the media room will

00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,680
translate into the Halle Berry language

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,200
and not hard language the serial port

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,810
data and the raw data will be sent to

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,880
the giant Python library in different

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,790
platform maybe it's a linux platform

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,670
maybe the Windows platform and some

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:54,850
stm32 okay sorry no notice it has

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,800
demonstrated to but the hardware is

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:01,630
different in different opening system so

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,820
it's isolated and our loss is easy to

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,570
use because we're up TJ joined the edge

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:10,870
header fail and TJ I joined the py for

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,760
paddle users so drivers can include

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,280
these two files and use them in their

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,520
code directly it is and implemented

00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,770
subscriber service clan and action lab

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,050
client here you can see the example

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,220
first to this is some private a member

00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,600
of a class like the tweet to present in

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:31,120
the joint studios likes attitude

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,240
contingent the first videos and the

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,150
kimball in for joy a pitch and this is

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,550
the topic function of the subscriber to

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,940
update this variable so once the

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,310
developers call maybe the joint on

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,080
attitudes and taking gaza latest added

00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,930
to the video in carrying about how this

00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:54,220
is implemented if he has no experience

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:57,730
with just before and this is a control

00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,010
hard to service and you can just tell

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,920
the DJ joe and i hatch hi alan to that

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,420
one fly for in 10 meters per second then

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,570
we will translating into the row

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,089
subscriber and a subscriber will send a

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:15,310
request to server the server will do the

00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:17,079
control part and also our code is a good

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,910
tutorial I believe that because I'd

00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,279
always many people that doesn't have

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,290
those experienced before and after they

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,620
using our code to see what those is

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,660
quite simple the wiki is too general to

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,690
Munson's in the wiki so teensy so they

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:35,170
can I found the most important area so

00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,870
in our code we implement topic is the

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,699
services and action labs and several

00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,829
other components and put them in

00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:45,510
different fell so the users can study on

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:50,199
goes for Hanson goes directly by our

00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:51,970
example code and we also called in three

00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,990
different languages the simplest pass

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:58,870
the pattern and the transcript and

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,120
obviously studi language was very and we

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,970
put some into the same loss network so

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:10,630
the divers can know how to do one kind

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:13,269
of symbiosis in what kind of way and so

00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,490
the code part is some it's done so I'd

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:18,040
like to share some stories formality

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,680
lefferts some of them from business and

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,140
symbolism from the University so they

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,810
all use matches my handler to do their

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,910
job maybe to make money or maybe into

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:35,920
polish paper for research purpose so

00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:39,339
square one is a company in America and

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,800
the combining the joint way severe and

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,769
using the virtual variety like to the

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,690
XDS envy so use it to do the past

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:49,569
planning like they put some casings in

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,279
the air by the beer one two three since

00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:53,550
there will be a pest passing through

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,500
them and then they will pass the

00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:00,279
trajectory to the drawn and the joint

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,199
will follow the plan passed and the

00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:07,240
camera will look at the exactly same

00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:10,329
angle so in this okay in this video you

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,660
can see the below one is there is a

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:16,899
trajectory to plan in the HGC way but

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,449
about one is real footage see how

00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:24,069
shot from the drones camera so you can

00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:26,559
see idea exactly the same and by the way

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:29,139
they didn't use the matrix mahendra they

00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,740
are using matches 600 instead it is a

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:35,769
another platform support it's another

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:39,040
platform from DJ also support a more SDK

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:42,399
but has more payload so you can add your

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,439
own camera right so maybe for some movie

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,839
makers you want to install the red

00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:50,679
camera on the John and they can choose

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,629
the m600 and use this choose to do the

00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:55,809
past planning and do the shooting in

00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:59,350
reality so this one is called a suicide

00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:02,980
that's an instrument to use some laser

00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:06,040
based method to to measure into air

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,899
quality so they need a flying platform

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,119
so it's a joint best air quality

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,670
measurement system so you can flying

00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:14,379
chicken measures the air quality of a

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,579
building's through windows by flying the

00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:20,230
joint directly without carrying about

00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,509
not without her part as you can to

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,689
either directly without going upstairs

00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:27,699
and downstairs on foot so this is all

00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,709
automated work because we pro has them

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:31,480
some interface to control the drone

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:35,579
flying in certain way and it's very

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,860
convenient to use and just two videos I

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:41,949
found them from the hydros papers on me

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,100
today and not this year and to left find

00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:47,889
some visual odometry and the red one is

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,249
some online pass planning method and

00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,889
they all used mattress mahendra as their

00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:57,870
platform to test their algorithm I know

00:14:53,889 --> 00:15:00,249
the other of the right one and ask him

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,350
how do you feel about matches 100 I

00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:04,749
think it's just good because it doesn't

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,059
care about how to control the drone I

00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:10,240
mean it doesn't need to care about how

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:12,579
to design controller of joint stable

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,649
controller he just need to call our aps

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:19,749
and the drone will fly exactly as what

00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:21,399
he want and these two pictures from this

00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:23,199
year's international air robots

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,110
commendation you can see that we found

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,959
them most of the teams about eight out

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,819
of ten they used our drones ahead their

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,699
platform to modify

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:36,910
so you do some mechanical change so the

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:42,729
metrics mahendra is not what myself but

00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:45,819
looks weird so and we also hold our own

00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:48,220
commutation we call it SDK challenge in

00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,869
this challenge this year to join me to

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,910
automatically landing on a moving

00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:54,910
vehicle and there is also some other

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,160
tasks for vision guided fried or object

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,179
if you can recognize Nisshin surprised

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,509
about 100 sell 100,000 US dollar and it

00:16:01,179 --> 00:16:08,049
will also hold this year so if some you

00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:10,389
guys interested in orem earning for the

00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:15,689
price will come to join the commendation

00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:15,689
we will pride equipment for free and

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:25,689
this is what the commander's done last

00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:28,689
year so the ball one is is a videos at

00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:31,809
the joints landing a moving object see

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:34,389
all you sleep or tag so at the ball one

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:36,809
the below one is the joints tracking an

00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:43,799
a protect this guy's is running very

00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:46,419
very fast and join it's more it's faster

00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,929
you can check you can find the joints

00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:52,029
lag on the video you can see the cameras

00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:56,439
looked at closely and sidon lost the

00:16:52,029 --> 00:17:01,269
object now I will talk about the future

00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:03,189
map the future roadmap DJ is always

00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:05,289
trying to involve more engineering

00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:09,159
skills and said interesting robotics to

00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:11,769
join this area so we hold our own week

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,990
all summer caps and during in this camp

00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:15,730
the students from different colleges all

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,549
over the world should working on some

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,529
certain problems for example this year

00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:23,620
they need to modify the mattress

00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:26,259
mahendra to pick up some maybe it's like

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:29,799
a toy I don't know what it exactly is so

00:17:26,259 --> 00:17:32,169
I'm putting some certain position and we

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,720
will hold it every year to train the

00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:37,049
young college students to involve in the

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,340
robotics area and then we also

00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,159
collaborated with some university lab

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,650
trees and we want to bring our devices

00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:47,830
equipments maybe the mattress behind

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:51,220
maybe some other sins to the lab tree so

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,260
the lab we can have some platform to

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,010
test their algorithm can do some

00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:00,130
projects and I think the most important

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,920
one is developer community so we are

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,410
trying hard to put more attention on the

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,960
developer come hit this year so first

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:11,080
maybe provide more technical support

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,450
then maybe some more showcases of

00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,620
interesting projects from our developers

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:19,450
and we also have some plan for the

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,360
industrial application and enterprise

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,910
solutions you can see this one is m600

00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,250
you saw it in last last last last a

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:29,980
slice and we also have a controller

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:33,130
called h3 just to add for the industrial

00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,230
purpose so you can some business

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,220
companies join you leave the pieces

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:43,810
companies are using just two to design

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:48,190
their product and selling so I'm a

00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:51,670
little fast so first thank you all still

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,400
staying here to listen to the last

00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:57,070
session and we are working hard to

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,680
provide the best software and hardware

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,230
experience for our developers each I

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,050
also came with attention on the

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,720
developer instead of the normal

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:11,230
marketing because we think that making

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:13,540
moneys is yeah I just talked with the

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,540
guy from parrot in the counter hey told

00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:20,080
me that the DJ is evil DJI is always

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:22,030
making money but far but actually we

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,270
also pay more attention than some

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:28,300
marketing on the technology so that's

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:31,060
the reason why we design and release so

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,980
John metrics 102 the developers so we

00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,460
want to involve more people in this area

00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,070
in the aerial robotics area and we used

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,750
Ross allow rostami design join for us

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,750
that's quite simple so

00:19:50,090 --> 00:20:13,950
hanging question maybe this one hello so

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:16,919
yeah I saw that on the website that the

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,080
SDK is comparable with the rose indygo

00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,390
are you planning to release the kinetic

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,330
competitive actually you can compile the

00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:26,160
code from the source wait it's open

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,230
source in the github so it doesn't

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:35,450
matter which version of us actually I

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:37,950
grab it in the ghost hydro right sorry

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,570
what what what the question was will it

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,799
compiling kinetic kinetic do you know ah

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,809
yeah it should be we have someone

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,240
working on the connect to support by the

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:59,669
way I haven't talked about him it should

00:20:48,240 --> 00:21:02,270
work to walk act and I'm very happy to

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:05,760
say like djx actually leading the

00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:08,850
consumer UAV industry on one quick

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,370
question is luck have you ever have you

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,100
already made some you RTF model for your

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,220
clones or your help oh do you have any

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,520
plan to luck we have the you rdf model

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,140
and it works in the RVs and maybe not

00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,360
Cat table I don't remember we have the

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,360
model it's in the github thank you

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,600
excuse me yeah thank you very much thank

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,820
you very much for your instruction I

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,429
already bought two of the DJ eyes matrix

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,410
100 and we want to access to the data of

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:44,340
manifolds that is em's I think the

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:47,700
cameras name is but it seems because we

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,650
want to encrypt with the new tx1 from

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,510
their media the computer we want to get

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,720
the data and it seems we can't get your

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:57,110
source code so do you pop kind of things

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,730
this is a this is a

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,860
most important compliant from our

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,890
customers we have received many of these

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,929
cases so I actually actually we want to

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,860
release the camera code but an FIR

00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:12,020
nearly to decode h.264 we need some

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,030
hardware chip from a media and this

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,010
lever is another open sourced so we

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,880
cannot open a solution to the diverse

00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:22,460
how to decode the media from DJ we have

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,420
some software we buy the land n sea is

00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:28,429
terrible so we have to desire on-board

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,549
computer called many photos led to our

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:33,410
products to our customers ok it is

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,960
preciate if you can provide some

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,270
libraries that we can to answer our

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,770
requirements like three hours is kind of

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,740
want to provide the best have some

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,760
lessons problem at all vism they say we

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:48,760
can't sorry about it ok thank you much

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,760
