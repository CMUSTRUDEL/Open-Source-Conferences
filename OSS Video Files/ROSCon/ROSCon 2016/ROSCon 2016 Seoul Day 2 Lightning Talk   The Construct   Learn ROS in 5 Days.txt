hi i'm ricardo i'm going to present you

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,230
a platform that we have developed at the

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,630
construct that allows to teach difficult

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:15,120
subject in robotics like drawers for

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:19,740
example in five days so our platform

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,390
it's already online you can get yes this

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,510
is a view of the platform you can visit

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,180
this address down here what we do is we

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,279
combine on one side the explanation

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,329
about the topic that you have to to

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,309
learn in a very practical way this is

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,110
another tutorial is described in a

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,940
practical way with actions that you have

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,520
to do into the simulation that you have

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,559
on the left hand side for example with

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,360
the start of world robot that is a robot

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,789
that we use for explaining the third

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,739
unit you can configure the screen in

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:58,469
order to see better the simulation

00:00:49,739 --> 00:01:02,070
bigger or smaller and yeah so you can

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,559
follow the step-by-step instructions in

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,310
order to learn the subject that you want

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,140
to learn by doing actions over the

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,010
simulations like this for example and

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,710
copying this command into the console

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,420
that we have here down so I can move the

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,350
robot and by this I'm learning the

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,049
concept of launching a Ross program in a

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,720
very easy way by seeing very clear and

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,360
very fast the relation between one thing

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,049
and the other as I said that you can

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,189
reconfigure the screen as you want in

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,290
your more convenient way we have several

00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:42,570
shells connected directly to the robot

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,090
that you are simulating and you can

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,880
select one of them on the top side you

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,579
can see the IDE integrated environment

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,049
in order to develop your Ross programs

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:58,619
in this case reconfiguring this you can

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:03,030
hide the the explanations in order to

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:06,509
have more space and else we have also

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,750
i'm selecting now here another shell and

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,250
i'm launching for example also graphical

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,960
tools for debugging like for example

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,500
arby's

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,300
in this case I'm launching the RV's you

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,640
will see how it appears but my time is

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,920
about to to finish I would like to to

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,420
tell you that this is just an example of

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,100
the course that you will have here is

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,410
the first course that we have developed

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,830
we are going to develop more on other

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,630
subjects and if you want us to create a

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,860
course or you want to create a course

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,170
for your specific topic just come and

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,080
talk to us or if you are a company

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,720
developing a robot and want to teach

00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,450
people how to use the robot talk to us

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,550
and we'll create a course for you and in

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:55,250
this platform everything is web-based

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,250
