hi everyone thank you for introduction

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,830
so my name is Bartos Costa Rica I would

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,469
present a university of science and

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,400
technology agh from krakow poland and

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:17,039
i'm here with with the team and yet we

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,939
are new to you too Ross but we hope to

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,769
jump into community quicker so what we

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,130
are doing and how we want to contribute

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,070
so the things that we create rockets

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,619
balloons Rovers things connected with

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,829
space systems and testing here on earth

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,380
so first the stratospheric balloon it

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,610
was prepared for global space challenge

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,149
for by experiments with automatic

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,070
control with attitude control and

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:50,100
observation of the of the earth so this

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:54,059
is the platform that can go up to 40

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,340
kilometer high and test the the system's

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,090
planetary probe developed for cancer

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,930
competition organized by by NASA and it

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,080
was prepared to a to monitor the earth

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,619
to simulate landing on on the other

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,130
planet and we can ultimate deployment

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,600
decent control observation and recovery

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,439
sounding crockett yeah this another one

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
yeah at this this actually works and the

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,909
sounding rocket is just for for

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,880
deployment of different different

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:33,119
systems in earth atmosphere at low

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:37,619
attitude so another one is just got it

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:41,119
hopefully yeah the nanosatellite just

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,770
just a simple simple stand to to create

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,479
to create a small stand for satellites

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:51,149
and test robotics onto the onto the

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,759
satellite especially for attitude

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,070
control and determine determination for

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,119
now we are using rhodos operation system

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,759
however we hope to to test another one

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,920
so as a mechatronic design Ross as you

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,099
know for rapid prototyping maybe not for

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,250
a flight for flight systems however it's

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,850
perfect for prototyping for research and

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,310
developing of control systems

00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:19,250
and Harvard hardware in a loop so right

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:21,280
now we are experimenting with FPGA with

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:26,810
redundant systems so if redundant

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:30,200
processes so yep and the big

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:35,330
implementation of the of the Ross all

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,330
right of the Ross operation system would

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:42,020
be presented by a panic in the next next

00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:46,280
speech so right now I just want to thank

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,650
our our great partners our a perfect

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,100
team they are all here we are with

00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,370
strong team of 10 people or maybe a bit

00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:59,150
of a bit higher and soon space if you

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,500
are interested in contact us just keep

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,500
