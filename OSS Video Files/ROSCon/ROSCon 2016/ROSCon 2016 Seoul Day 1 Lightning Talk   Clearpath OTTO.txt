thank you very much last up is me

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:17,100
actually all right so um so we just we

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,880
just raised 30 million dollars and this

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,880
is what we're doing with it

00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:30,340
I apologize for the lack of technical

00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:31,270
details this is meant for marketing now

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,640
that doesn't mean we're actually

00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,229
abandoning our research clients far from

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,770
it because we're just releasing

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,770
something else too

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,520
this platform was actually done in a

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:09,330
partnership with another organization

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,610
that actually the base was done for the

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,349
Canadian Space Agency in NASA and now

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,970
they've taken it customized it further

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,840
and we turn it into something a little

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,840
different

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,640
