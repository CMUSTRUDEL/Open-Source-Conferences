alright so if somebody from you was

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,980
there at last year's ross con there was

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,200
a bird of the feather session about like

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,330
how to actually program like what's the

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,269
right way of like what what editor do

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,190
you use what should my IDE use like be

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:15,960
like how should i configure it and all

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,250
the stuff and it was an interesting

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,480
discussion because of course everybody

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,640
has his own opinion what the right

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,189
editor is but since last year a lot of

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,769
stuff has changed me personally I worked

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,869
a long time this sublime text and since

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,939
last year actually was able to switch to

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,740
Adam and I just want to give my short

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,170
experience and also how to easily start

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,420
with that so one big advantage of Adam

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,430
is that's very highly customizable so as

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,579
I would say almost nothing you can just

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,800
add as a plug into it and of course for

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,030
everybody who programs all the day you

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,530
just don't want to touch your mouse you

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,850
just want to have your hands on the

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,710
keyboard all the time so it's good that

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,719
you can do every single shortcuts but

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,610
that's pretty common the good things

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,289
it's very feature-rich editors so you

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,870
can have syntax highlighting standard

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,230
you can have linters which will validate

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,840
that your code complies to a certain

00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:06,060
certain constraints like Python code for

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,729
example to the pep have a tour to pep

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,320
257 standard or you want to ensure that

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,210
actually your code while your type is

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,380
not actually enveloped if it's c++ you

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,200
don't even have to start the compiler

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,810
for that and we can happen in background

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,250
or if you write like a gazebo model you

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,689
just want to like just validate it

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,360
immediately if you miss type and

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,500
attribute it just tell you immediately

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,210
all the completion also also very

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,220
standard and you want to have access to

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,350
all the documentation so def docs that

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,360
IO is a place where documentation from

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,650
different languages gets accumulated so

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,590
it's good to have that like at the

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,119
fingertip but there are also features

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,740
like this example where you have a

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,210
really complicated in this case not that

00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,770
complicated regular expression and you

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,479
just want to visualize it and the editor

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,649
just has plug-ins for that you just go

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,140
to the regular expression you see the

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,960
nicer a little diagram it's just a lot

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,220
of benefits for you as a developer

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,720
usually it's very difficult like set it

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,750
all up because there's so many packages

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,360
involved so how can you get bootstrapped

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,090
easier to get started and try it out

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,979
well the steps are really simple by now

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,110
that was not year that the case last

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,179
year but now you just install Adam you

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,459
install a single packet it's called sync

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,690
settings and then in order to configure

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,060
everything you

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,100
first have to enter your token for

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,660
github and then you can clone an

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,370
existing configuration you can for

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,770
example use the 1i reference that's the

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,230
1i Connolly used it's a gist file on

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,880
github you just clone that I've knowed

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,880
by that one you get the same setup i use

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,930
on my machine and that's great you

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,060
sometimes have to install some

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,340
dependencies like python have eight or

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,040
something so that's not optimal yet but

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,690
i think that's a good start to get to

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,310
try out Adam so if you want to give it a

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,780
shot and or if you want to give feedback

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,050
or if you want to see the configuration

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,640
just see me later and I can show it life

00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,640
