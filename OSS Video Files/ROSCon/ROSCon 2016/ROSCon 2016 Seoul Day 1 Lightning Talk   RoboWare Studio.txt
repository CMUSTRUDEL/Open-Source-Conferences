everyone just before that presentation I

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,160
just asked how many people use ID for

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,769
your laws

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,740
ross programming please raise your hand

00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:20,760
not too many that's quite a few when I

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,430
start to use Ross I always I was always

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,160
struggling with programming with like

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,610
just text editor and then come on the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,210
line so I always asked myself why there

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:38,940
there is no environment for Low's

00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,090
programming my own so it is I'm not

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,420
smart enough so that's the reason why I

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,879
need that but after I had several

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,260
interviews many interviews with with

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,750
some college students to ask them what

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,420
do you feel about Ross they always said

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:02,480
the entrance level of Ross is quite high

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:08,460
so it's not easy for them to start their

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:11,070
development being Ross so we know Lobos

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,770
business and research is you know

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,409
getting developed faster and faster so

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,909
we can we need more people to go to this

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:23,460
area so I think probably we need a quite

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,799
good tool to help them to get into that

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,130
area so that's the reason why we

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,869
developed a lot of ways to studio just

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:37,140
as Adam said we also send to github

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,500
because we use election estep based code

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,610
as well and we use a vs code as the

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,079
second level to support us to develop a

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,970
tool specially for lost development so

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,399
that's provided lost works basement

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,560
management code editing beauty in

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:03,680
debugging etc and that make makes Ross

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,570
development quite easy I just give you a

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,420
demo

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,600
this is the procedure if we use rubber

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:20,470
worse to do just lunge it then we can

00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:25,860
set up a workspace and then we can

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,860
create a new package just put name in

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,890
then we can see if we want to add a note

00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:40,300
logo our studio will ask you to boot up

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,600
executable file or a Lib file say it

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:50,380
will automatically modify Simic vilest

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:53,800
to do that and you can edit it you can

00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:58,480
get the syntax highlighting code

00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:02,080
completion go to definition etc to make

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,590
the programming quite easy and then you

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,820
can debug it you can set a break point

00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:11,620
and track everything okay after compare

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,440
you can see you can see the know the

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,220
list here and then you can put the

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,220
arguments in

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,120
