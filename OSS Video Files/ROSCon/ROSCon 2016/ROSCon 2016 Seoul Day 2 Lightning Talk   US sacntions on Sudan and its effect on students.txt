okay this is kind of a strange topic to

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,760
be talking about here but the effects of

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,620
the sanctions also done its first of all

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,019
we're not politically motivated in any

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,750
way we're just University students and

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,490
we we have experienced this firsthand so

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,460
we'd like to share this story with all

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:25,830
of you the negative impacts of the US

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,960
sanctions are irrefutable okay the whole

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,060
Sudanese community is actually affected

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,989
by these sanctions for example whereby

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,840
they can't import medical equipment the

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,360
Sudanese community is deprived of

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,510
importing or exporting leading to very

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,700
immediate negative and tangible effects

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,600
that have that lead to chronic poverty

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:52,640
poverty the correlation between

00:00:47,600 --> 00:01:03,080
sanctions and poverty cannot be denied

00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:06,090
okay sorry why first of all letters of

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,090
credit letters of credit cannot be

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,060
issued for people and this compels them

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,520
to go and find alternative ways to go

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,890
around this and so they can't really

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:23,549
import or export in the usual manner our

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,820
personal experience is we have tried to

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,450
obtain equipment to actually develop and

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,790
start Ross and it has been tough because

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,560
you had to find someone there that you

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,530
know so that they can buy what you want

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,030
and then send them to you which can take

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:44,119
months but we are here today and we have

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,890
been successful in learning Ross in

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:49,770
about four year now but without

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,170
mentorship and no form of course is just

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,990
learning online and trying to find

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:59,509
whichever code we could find to try and

00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:03,030
implement something that works okay and

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:05,969
for this is a girl telling President

00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,890
Obama about the effects of the sanctions

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:10,590
on the Sudanese community and you can

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,120
see the pictures there how what we get

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,340
when we try and access some of the

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,560
websites

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:21,019
so this is what we've been working on

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,629
it's a turtle bot and we've been

00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:25,870
successful in making maps and

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:28,970
implementing some path planning

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,150
algorithms such as a star and right now

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:35,569
we're working on integrating this simple

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,950
arm here with turtlebot so that it can

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:42,110
do like regular taken place you know

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,030
objects around the house so that's what

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:50,959
we've been working on I cannot express

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,549
my gratitude for everyone here who

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,440
actually helped the sponsors and Diana

00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:59,660
it's it has been amazing an amazing

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,260
experience to actually network with

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,560
everyone here this is what we're trying

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,510
to do here we're first of all we have to

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,010
develop our project further so that it

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,250
can be used for homes and restaurants

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:17,120
and we are actually among the first

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:20,420
people there I say in my country who are

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,760
using Ross so that is something that I

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,530
like to tell everyone like one of the

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,660
first people to use roster so and our

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,790
next plan is well to start a robotics

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,940
lab in the in our University the

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,739
University of Khartoum then we can maybe

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,190
go on to high schools and start

00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:43,430
academies there and maybe sometime later

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:47,090
organized Africa's first frost con I

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:52,900
don't know expert so that's that's it

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:56,120
I'd like to thank Diana for ah just I

00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,290
don't really find people like this a lot

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,440
in life and she she made the process so

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,959
much easier and you know you're getting

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,000
depressing email sometimes and like oh

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,370
you're from Sudan so can't really do

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,549
anything about that no we actually tried

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,349
and really helped us get here so I'd

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:20,150
like to thank her and thank everyone

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:23,720
behind scenes that we haven't met I have

00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:26,020
no words to express myself

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,020
