I'm Sanjay sorry from topeka robotics we

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,910
build low-cost connected robots this is

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,910
kind of an introduction

00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:20,240
so the takeaway from all this is

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,369
basically connecting robots opens up

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,690
possibilities that weren't possible

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,490
earlier and though it does this it adds

00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,850
an additional layer of complexity right

00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:34,060
and some of these examples are like if

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,410
your robot is sitting at a client site

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,960
thousands of miles away you still need a

00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:41,539
way to talk to the robot updated deal

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,860
with those sort of things if you have

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,410
the cloud it gives you limitless

00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,020
computation in storage but you need a

00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:52,640
declarative way to actually manage the

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,560
application lifecycle and also actually

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,200
harness the benefits of the cloud like

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,630
the elasticity of it the robustness off

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,190
the cloud and now that you have the

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,100
cloud you have a web browser you have a

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,170
robot you have an edge location you need

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,880
the some sort of messaging layer to

00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,550
connect all this up and make everything

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,580
work together and all these complexities

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:16,130
basically mean time and I think that

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,200
basically the robotics developer should

00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,900
spend time on building the best robotic

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,459
experience for instance a robot that

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,550
quickly gets me my beer from the fridge

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:28,880
in an optimal way that would be great

00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,650
and the cloud platform should take away

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,620
these things from the developer and

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,349
actually provide a basic building block

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,390
and I think that's very similar to how

00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:39,430
what brought along the mobile revolution

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,349
and you have

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,930
add the app store and you had all these

00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,450
distribution channels and the entire

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,010
ecosystem that was built up and that

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,019
actually allowed you to scale to

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,909
millions of users and if you can do that

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,409
with the cloud for robotics we can

00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:57,040
probably see the next generation of

00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:59,019
robots evolve that said I'd love to talk

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,650
to you people about this come say hello

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,650
