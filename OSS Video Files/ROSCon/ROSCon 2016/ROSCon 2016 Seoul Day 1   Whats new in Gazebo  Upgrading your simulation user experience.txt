all right let me try to get my

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,540
positioning right hello everyone happy

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,400
ross khan my name is stephanie key i'm a

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,160
cofounder at open source robotics

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,469
foundation and was previously the user

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,269
experience designer there and I'm

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,880
currently with Toyota Research Institute

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:19,830
as an interaction designer and I'm

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,650
Louise fobel I'm a software engineer at

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,980
the open source robotics foundation I

00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,240
have a very brief disclaimer against our

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,810
better judgment we made our entire

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,090
presentation a live demo so we had some

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,040
we'd had some issues last night getting

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,719
our very well tested machine working

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,850
with the AV system so we're using a

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,219
borrowed computer right now so bear with

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,340
us cross your fingers that the live demo

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,969
God smiled upon us and we'll just hope

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,610
for the best so we're here to tell you

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:57,059
today about gazebo and what's new in

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:59,010
gazebo seven so just to get a sense for

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,340
the room can you please raise your hand

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,789
if you have heard of gazebo okay that's

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,610
a good number

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,670
um how many of you that's a good start

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,930
how many of you are using gazebo okay

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,200
and keep your hands up if you're using

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,060
gazebo seven okay great so it's not that

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,920
many that's not the great part but we

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,450
have a lot to share with you about what

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,729
is available to you in gazebo seven so

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,619
just at a high level gazebo is a dynamic

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,810
simulator that lets you simulate robots

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,270
in indoor and outdoor environments and

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,860
the idea is that a simulated robot is

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,920
the next best thing to having a physical

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,880
one with a simulated robot you can very

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,439
quickly easily and cheaply make changes

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,420
to your robot and your code and see what

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,000
the outcome is so if you have a robot

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,920
that runs Ross the Ross code will run

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,619
the same in simulation as it will on

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,549
your physical robot the actuators and

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,899
the sensors wall behave the same way and

00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:57,299
again the benefit there is that you can

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,740
very quickly iterate through changes in

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:05,520
your development process and so we have

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,350
a very quick video to show you and it

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,509
goes very quickly because we have a lot

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,120
of features to get through but just to

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:13,650
give you a sense for the use cases and

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,040
how cuz he Bo's been used

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,319
so we have a lot of industrial arms that

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,970
have been simulated in gazebo mobile

00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,760
bases a lot of humanoid robots

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,409
that's the Atlas you may recognize it

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,319
from the DARPA Robotics Challenge a

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,680
swarm robots so large large groups of

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:39,269
robots you can simulate those aerial

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:43,110
vehicles underwater robots are also in

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:47,790
their modular robots their support for

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,099
that we support indoor and outdoor

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,690
environments as I mentioned we have a

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,129
lot of sensors available to you and

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,379
we'll go over those in more detail

00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,209
raus integration you may have very

00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,819
briefly seen our VA's being used next to

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,440
cozy bow a number of hardware

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,359
integration examples which we'll talk

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,400
more about and gazebo has been used a

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:14,670
lot in competitions as well also

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,349
education and for prototyping so you can

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:25,380
simulate something in gazebo and then

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:26,940
build it afterwards so as you could see

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,980
by the videos there is a lot going on in

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,629
gazebo it can simulate a variety of

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,819
different robots in a variety of

00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,620
different environments and this all

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,780
starts with SD format which is the

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,370
format we use to describe everything in

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,650
a simulation from the mechanical design

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,730
of the robot to all the visuals and the

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,549
sensors and everything you're seeing

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,739
there I know this is a hot topic that's

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,560
being Ross con most of you probably use

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:56,419
you RDF I just want to say that we come

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:58,829
in peace but also we are using 3/4

00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:02,069
physics engines in gazebo right now and

00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,290
you write the same SDF description of

00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:06,000
your world and you write the same C++

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,260
plugins and at runtime you can choose

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,930
which one of these physics engines

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,699
you're gonna use so this is a very good

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,560
advantage of gazebo that you can choose

00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,359
the one that is most suitable for your

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,489
application the ones we support right

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,430
now are the open dynamics engine OTE

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,930
bullet dart which is changing its name

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,140
to Quito and we're gonna support that as

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,420
well and same body for rendering we're

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,910
using auger and

00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,640
rendering is not only about what we are

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,560
seeing here in like the user sees but

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,960
also what the robot sees so cause if is

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,580
not only simulating the actuators of the

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,440
robot and how the robot interacts with

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,750
the environment physically but also that

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,580
all the sensor data that is that it

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,740
would get in the real world we are also

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,740
generating it inside gazebo for your

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,360
robot just like it would be in reality

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:54,650
and ogre is being used for the camera

00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,650
and all the rendering of RGB data we use

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,150
cute for the graphical interface so all

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,280
the menus that you're seeing here we're

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,200
done with cute and we're gonna show some

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,380
demos later that also have different

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,940
menus done in cute we use protobuf for

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,850
the messages passed between clients and

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,350
server and we use the we're using more

00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,060
and more of the ignition libraries a

00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,820
little bit of a big backstory here

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,840
gazebo itself is very big and composed

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,670
of many different libraries so there is

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,740
gazebo Math gazebo physics rendering and

00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,480
each one of these is a separate library

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,070
but they are all bundled inside gazebo

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,070
right now and we're in the process of

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,650
separating them into their own packages

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,330
that can be reused by other people and

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,760
in the process also making a zip itself

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,130
smaller we're also making sure that

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,100
these libraries are cross-platform from

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:47,420
day one so they work equally well in

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,790
Linux Mac and Windows we are ready

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,680
deprecating all of gazebo math and in

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,720
favor of ignition math and there's

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,430
ignition messages in ignition tres part

00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,230
being used in gazebo soon as well and

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:01,910
we're actively working on ignition

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:03,200
common and rendering so before we get to

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,090
the features I want to tell you a little

00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,830
bit about why I'm up here I mentioned

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,870
that I'm a user experience designer and

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,660
what that means is that I advocate for

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,570
the end user and I worry about user

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,800
friendliness usability and that the

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,610
features we're building are actually

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,150
useful to people

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,860
so when OSR I first started working very

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,320
heavily on gazebo a number of years ago

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,690
the primary user base was what I would

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,020
consider a power user so folks in

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,730
academia PhD students professors people

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,920
with a lot of computer science and

00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,990
programming skills and that was great

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,880
but we also wanted to see boat to be

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,840
more accessible to a wider variety of

00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,330
people

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,700
so these are folks with maybe no

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,340
simulation experience or not a lot of

00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,990
programming experience to begin with so

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,910
to achieve this we focused a lot of

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,460
effort on the GUI the graphical user

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,100
interface and making that usable and

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,870
we've gotten it to a point now where the

00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,180
GUI is helpful for both groups of people

00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,740
so you can interact with gazebo in a

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,090
meaningful way without ever touching the

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,160
command line which was a huge

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,430
accomplishment for us I think it's a

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,310
great thing but more advanced users who

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,400
may normally use gazebo only for the

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,169
backend stuff now can use the GUI for

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,120
things like debugging their model

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,150
tweaking their environment and plotting

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,740
variables that they're interested in

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,590
we've also put a lot of effort into

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,880
improving the C++ API we like to say

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,770
that if you can write a plug-in you can

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,150
change the world and I'll tell you about

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,790
that later

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,440
we've also added quite a bit of

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,320
documentation to the website and we'll

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,210
show you those links later so the common

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,400
denominator here is user built usability

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,919
and user friendliness so I'm gonna talk

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,840
to you briefly about sort of the

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,169
workflow we have at open source robotics

00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,700
foundation and how a UX or user

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,620
experience designer can best work with

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,650
an engineering team so the top two

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,539
examples are sort of less than ideal in

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,400
the first one you often have a UX

00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,750
designer designing something and then

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,070
they throw it over to the fence to

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,840
engineering without really having a

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,600
sense for what's hard and what's gonna

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,919
take a long time and then it gets built

00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,190
and then that's the end of it there's

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,440
not much usability testing now the flip

00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,090
side of that is the engineering team

00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,530
just built something and then maybe at

00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,360
the end there are some usability issues

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,970
and you try to kind of slap some user

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,139
experience on at the end and you can

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,320
imagine that that doesn't necessarily

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,490
have the best outcomes so ideally you're

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,490
following the iterative design process

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,289
which is how we do it at OS RF there's a

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,000
lot of UX work upfront but the

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,890
engineering team and the UX person are

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,870
always talking and always working

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:38,380
together those little blue spikes are

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,990
usability testing and iteration on

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,919
features so that's all I will say about

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,910
that if you're interested in talking

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,680
more find me at a coffee break

00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,100
so now we're gonna do some demos and see

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,620
how it goes

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,060
the if you haven't noticed yet this

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,630
whole presentation is happening within

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,680
gazebo we're showing you we're doing it

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,170
this way because it's the best way to

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,300
show you what gazebo is capable of and

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,850
some of the features were showing you

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,710
are available now in gazebo seven but

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,480
some of them will be released with a

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,160
gazebo eight but if you're comfortable

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,840
building from source you can get

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:19,230
everything right away so an important

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:22,410
part of making simulation useful is

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,150
having compelling worlds sorry everyone

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,880
has different needs when it comes to

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,460
simulation so we've added support for

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,410
scripted trajectories or actors you may

00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,150
notice the drones circling the slide and

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,330
this is a very simple scripted

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:38,820
trajectory at some point you may see a

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,760
person walking around or moonwalking

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,800
backwards that is also an actor keep an

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,780
eye out for him we have support for

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,510
digital heightmap digital elevation

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,100
models and this is really useful if

00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,920
you're interested in a very particular

00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,390
piece of terrain in the real world so

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,040
there's a tutorial online that'll show

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,100
you how to cut out that terrain and

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,110
import it into gazebo to use in your

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,150
simulation world and the image you see

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,010
up there is a screenshot of Mount st.

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,800
Helens and we use that in a gazebo

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,870
simulation if you're interested in

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,160
autonomous vehicles it's also easier now

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,320
to add roads to your worlds another

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,800
important part of having a good world is

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,050
having good models we now support nested

00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,670
models so if you have a model of a

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,470
sensor that you want to add into another

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,200
model that you're building you can have

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,840
a model within a model we also support

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,650
populations of models so you can insert

00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,180
a population of models in a specified

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:39,300
configuration so those raus dots of

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,830
there are an example of a population so

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,630
instead of having to drag models in one

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:47,940
by one you can kind of do it in one fell

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,890
swoop an important part of having a good

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,080
world is being able to get around in the

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,270
world and I should say on this slide

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,440
there's a little wireframe and we we put

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,080
a few of these in just to give you a

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,800
sense for how designs start out in an

00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,840
iterative

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,360
design flow so this is a very low

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,190
fidelity paper prototype we did for the

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,170
demo that we're about to do the feature

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:12,480
we're about to show you so you can kind

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:14,520
of see how it progresses so if if you're

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,279
curious to see how your model responds

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,620
if you apply force or torque to it it's

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,930
easy to do that now within the GUI and

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,430
the weasel show you what happens if you

00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:32,370
shove this slide a little bit and you

00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:34,760
might know it's gonna fall yeah I really

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,980
appreciate your enthusiasm this is great

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,690
so one major usability feature that we

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,029
have added which I'm very proud of is

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,029
the ability to undo this is a new thing

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,220
so you can undo and you can redo to your

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,510
heart's content which we're very excited

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,940
about if you're interested in sort of

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,680
inspecting a model from close up we make

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,630
it easy to switch between perspective

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,370
and orthographic views you can toggle

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,800
back and forth we also have these

00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,040
predefined view angles that you can use

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,450
to zoom in around your model and if you

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,980
find that you're in a weird spot you can

00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,660
hit the home button and it'll take you

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:19,140
back to the view you were in when you

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:20,670
first loaded the world one of the most

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,440
difficult things in simulation is

00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,960
getting all your mechanical parameters

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,550
right for your robot it's very common

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,950
than people have a robot that just

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,470
explodes in simulation or behaves in a

00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,150
very weird way and tweaking all these

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,070
little parameters can be something very

00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,050
hard so we're adding a lot of

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,839
visualization tools to gazebo that help

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:42,240
you quickly look and spot what could be

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,850
the problems in your model so right here

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,680
I have a you are 10 robot that I'm gonna

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:50,220
show you some of the visualizations we

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,420
have right now so first I'm gonna make

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:57,510
it transparent so I just click on it and

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,580
see parent and then I'm gonna take a

00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,529
look at the joint frames sorry the

00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,240
linked frames which are basically the

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:05,400
origin for each one of the links so you

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,250
can see that this these frames the red

00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,810
green green blue lines show the frame

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,820
for each one of the links and as you

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,310
click on them they highlight so you can

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,230
quickly

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,170
associate the link to the origin of that

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,880
link and you can quickly see oh I have

00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:22,390
the wrong axis that's what was going on

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,890
or I have the wrong sign another thing

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,890
you can take a look at are the joints

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:32,230
and you can see that for each joint you

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,510
can see the joint frame and you can see

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,180
the joint axis itself is marked in

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,890
yellow in case of revolute joints as all

00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:41,830
the joints in this robot you can see

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,650
that they are marked with this circle

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,450
here and you can see this one is on the

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,610
y axis because it's green this one is on

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,880
the z axis so you can also have very

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:54,190
quick feedback on how the on where the

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,370
joints are placed another important

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:00,460
thing to look at our collisions and all

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,350
the robots basically have collisions and

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,330
visuals collisions are basically what

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,490
the physics engine can see and visuals

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,770
are what the red ring can see and in

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,270
general you want to have collisions that

00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:12,640
are formed of simple shapes by simple

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,490
shapes I mean boxes fears and cylinders

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:18,580
so you want to approximate the shape of

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,380
your robot as much as as better as good

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:23,080
as possible with these simple shapes

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,240
here we can see that you're you have all

00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,520
these cylinders approximating the Rio

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,350
the visual shape of the robot there and

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,640
these are the shapes that are actually

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,680
are gonna collide with each other and so

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,480
on so let's turn off collisions and

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:40,300
let's take a look at the center of mass

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,640
so for each link we can see the center

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,580
of mass of that link represented by a

00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,490
sphere that has this that is a sphere of

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:50,950
lead the very heavy metal that has the

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,780
same mass as your link so if the sphere

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,910
is as big as your link it means that

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,230
your link is as dense as lead and maybe

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,390
there's something wrong there maybe your

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,640
robots just heavy but it gives you this

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,589
notion of if something is wrong or maybe

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,300
the center of mass is completely away

00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:05,650
from your robot which happens more often

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,170
than you would think and you can quickly

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,580
see that it's also good for you to have

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,310
a notion of how the mass is distributed

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,589
in your model so sometimes you can see

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,940
oh there's more mass on this side that's

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:19,240
why the robot is behaving kind of

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,730
weirdly so I hide that for a bit and

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,220
this one is really cool it's the inertia

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,720
visualizations and inertia is something

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,209
that is really hard to get

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,399
real intuitive idea about it's a matrix

00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:32,620
it has a lot of values nobody says like

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,500
my robot has the inertia of one point

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:38,199
something and X and you know nobody has

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,430
an intuitive idea of this so when you're

00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,079
just tweaking the numbers it's kind of

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,509
hard to see what's wrong but when you

00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,420
visualize it you can quickly spot the

00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:49,149
mistakes so here for each link we show a

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,790
box that has the same inertia as your

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,459
link as if it was a box of uniform

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,170
density and in general you want this box

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,600
to kind of match the shape of your link

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,490
and the size of it of course it's just

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,980
an approximation you're real robots

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,019
probably not gonna have uniform density

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,120
and this might be dislocated a little

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,149
bit but it already gives you a good idea

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,759
of where the problems could be coming

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:17,399
from finally we're gonna make a

00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:21,040
wireframe view and I'm gonna turn on

00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,660
contact so contact is not as much for

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,490
you to debug one model but more for you

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,930
to debug how models are interacting with

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,509
each other you can see that when the

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,040
robot hits the slide we can see these

00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,660
points here and this is where the

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,680
physics engine is actually calculating

00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:38,350
the collisions so you can quickly take

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,850
if you have your robot interacting with

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:46,509
the objects you can quickly see where

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:48,550
they are touching or not Louise is gonna

00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:50,500
show you the building editor so this is

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,259
a tool that lets you create very simple

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,809
models of a building just using the GUI

00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:58,449
and again there's an example of a low

00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:01,930
fidelity prototype and you'll see the

00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:04,360
current state of the building editor so

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:09,270
let's open the building editor I'm gonna

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:12,010
place the view here so we have here the

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,319
on the top it's the 2d view of our

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,179
building and on the left here we have a

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,490
palette with a lot of options for our

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,600
building so the first thing that you can

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,610
do in the building editor which is

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,829
really cool is import a floor plan of an

00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,990
area that you already know and you just

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:29,260
want to draw that so we have a floor

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,880
plan here of a little place so we

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,799
imported if you know the resolution you

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,419
can just type it here if you don't you

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,159
can kind of click on two points in the

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:38,169
image and you know you have a rough

00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,510
estimator this is about 5 meters and we

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,389
scale the image for you

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:44,639
and now it's just about starting to draw

00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:46,320
walls in it so you can just here with

00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:47,820
the wall to draw you can see that they

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:54,210
are showing up in the 3d view as I'm

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:56,510
drawing this mouse is really fast so I'm

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,549
drawing here let's put another wall here

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,169
you can also add stairs and everything

00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:06,029
that you're adding in your building you

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:08,190
can just double click it you can double

00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:11,149
click it and see and tweak all the

00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:14,070
numbers if you want them wide one by one

00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:15,840
we can add doors and windows so the

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:19,500
doors and windows right now are

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,700
basically just holes in the in the walls

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:27,240
so this is gonna be cut out of well once

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,100
the building is saved let's place a

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,380
window here and you kind of can't see

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,000
because you're what you're drawing is on

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,549
top of your floor plan so you can

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,820
quickly with hotkeys visualize and and

00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:43,200
hide one of one and the other to see the

00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:45,120
other one and have a notion of it a

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,669
little bit bigger you can also add

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,230
colors so you just click here there are

00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,480
some preset colors it can also click on

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,179
more to add your custom colors you can

00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,970
add textures here just you know click on

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:59,909
things around and make your very ugly

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,559
then you can also add another level to

00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,299
your building and it just copies all the

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,039
wind I'll do it walls from the previous

00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:07,260
one you can always just like click on

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:12,240
them and delete them and do what you

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,919
want so let's close this save it and

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,289
then we're gonna be back in simulation

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,019
with our building ready to be used

00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:23,039
you saw that the hole was cut out from

00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:25,320
the floor to give way for the stairs and

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:44,340
here inside the building we can see the

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:46,470
windows and things like that so this is

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,389
the building edit that the model editor

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,740
and the model editor is more general

00:19:48,389 --> 00:19:53,870
than the building editor that you can

00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:58,370
edit any robot and any object in your

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,900
right there on the spot so to edit a an

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,610
object that is already simulation you

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,890
can just right click it and say edit

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,299
model and you're gonna be inside the

00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,380
model editor I'm gonna delete this

00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:10,669
because I was playing with this earlier

00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,350
so the first cool thing that you have in

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,120
the model editor is the schematic view

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,799
up here and it shows you all the links

00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,120
and nested models that you have in your

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,870
model and how they are connected by

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,490
joints the first thing we're gonna do

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,900
here is insert some simple shapes so if

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,580
I insert the cylinder here it's getting

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,470
through the link that has a visual and a

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,049
collision that are both cylinders you

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:33,110
can just use the scaling tool to scale

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:38,059
it and rotation tool and so on to make

00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:41,809
it the the shape that you want you can

00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:45,410
also import Colada meshes and STL meshes

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:49,040
and you can extrude SVG files which are

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,799
2d files into 3d shapes you can also

00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,030
right-click any link in your model and

00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,370
here you have all the options that you

00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,590
would have in SDF and you can just come

00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,330
here and tweak the values and see the

00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,610
changes in real time so like if I make

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,400
it blue you can see that it turned blue

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:07,669
immediately we can use the alignment

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:12,770
tools so I'm gonna select these two and

00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:15,799
I line them on the top here and here and

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,840
just place it there let's try to move

00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:22,210
this one to kind of match that target

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,770
that we have on the yeah right here and

00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,140
you can use copy paste so if you select

00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,360
it and you do control C control V you

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,270
have another one of the same link so

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,590
let's also align this one here again

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:39,020
just using the alaman alaman tools okay

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,200
let's move it a little bit here let's

00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:44,150
see what I'm making we can also insert

00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,040
in this insert a nested model so you can

00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,520
get any model that isn't the Gazebo

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,130
online database right here or any models

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,429
that your you have locally installed so

00:21:52,130 --> 00:22:04,480
I'm gonna get a where did the help we

00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:04,480
are go hmmm this is Derek's computer

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:12,710
I can try to insert it it's funny oh

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,820
yeah oh that the mode at first

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:20,030
thank you bar for the Internet's so I'm

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:24,410
gonna rotate it here and let's align

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:28,370
that too so we click here and then let's

00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:30,080
unhide it and there you go so now we

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,150
have three links in an asset model in

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,470
our model but they are not connected to

00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,179
each other let's make some joint so

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,830
there's the joint creation so here you

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,260
can click on the parent link and in the

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,330
child link and we create a joint then we

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,070
can see the exes is not where we want we

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,960
want it to be green which is why so we

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,299
just choose it here and we can quickly

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,669
move it here on the Z app which is the

00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:52,280
blue one and let's move it a little bit

00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:54,350
more up yeah that's good enough for now

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,600
so we created and then let's create

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,990
another joint between this one and this

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,880
one so we also want this one

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,860
this one let's make it in minus y so it

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,980
matches the other one and let's move it

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,190
in negative Z which is the opposite

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:13,370
there a little bit more let's go okay

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,230
great now let's connect the hook who you

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,360
otherwise it's gonna fall off let's just

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,910
make a fixed joint here so I click fixed

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,400
create that's it another thing we want

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,260
to do is make our model heavier because

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,880
now that I attached a bunch of stuff to

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,410
it I don't want it to fall off let's

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,210
just make it tungsten and it's very cool

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,460
because once I select the density it's

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,350
gonna calculate the mass and also the

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,320
inertia matrix for me based on the shape

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:46,419
automatically okay so I think our mother

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:49,460
is good let's save it exit okay and

00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:51,470
we're back in simulation we're pause so

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:55,160
let's just hide this and press play and

00:23:51,470 --> 00:24:02,030
that's it so we have a very ugly double

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:03,559
pendulum there so now that we have this

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,230
double pendulum we can show you the

00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,419
plotting tool and the plotting tool is

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,270
really neat if you're interested in

00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:14,210
plotting a variable and it can be a

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:16,610
gazebo topic or pretty much any piece of

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,590
physics data so you can see Louise's use

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,530
the search feature to look for the link

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:26,179
she's interested in and then you can

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:28,490
drag the variable on to a plot and it

00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:30,470
just pops up immediately if you you can

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:33,170
have one or more variables per plot or

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,490
you can have a whole bunch of plots kind

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,750
of whatever whatever you're interested

00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:40,460
in you just add one more and there's an

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,530
export tool down at the bottom if you

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:49,130
want to come back and check out the plot

00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:51,260
at a later date yep so now we're going

00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,220
to talk a little bit about sensors these

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,770
are the ones that have been added

00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,799
recently it's not a complete list and I

00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,630
should say that a lot of these came from

00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,860
outside contributors it's not just OS or

00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:05,390
F working on this the altimeter and oh I

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,630
wanted to say the beauty of simulated

00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,580
sensors is that they're free and you can

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,080
very easily swap them in and out so if

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,309
Louise changed her mind and didn't want

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,140
the Hoku yo she could have easily

00:25:13,309 --> 00:25:20,210
swapped it out for something else very

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:22,160
quickly yeah so the altimeter and the

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,169
magnetometer were added recently in

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,890
response to the UAV craze that's

00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:31,549
sweeping the world the wide angle and

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:33,650
depth cameras were added recently you

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,030
can use the sensors on a robot or if you

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:36,770
just want to do computer vision you can

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,510
use them as standalone sensors as well

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,440
there's an example of a little camera

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:45,559
there just checking out the house and

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,780
we've had a request for a radar for

00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:54,080
autonomous vehicles that's not done yet

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:56,780
but is in the works great so now we have

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,669
the logging and playback tool so this is

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,669
great if you want to go back and relive

00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:03,290
a simulation after you have run it this

00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:06,470
is one that we recorded earlier it's

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,929
turtlebot bowling with beer cans and you

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,840
can scrub back and forth and simulation

00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:13,640
change the view angle and you can use

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,370
all of the same introspection tools that

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,500
Louise showed you a little while ago so

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:23,150
this is a great tool if you yea want to

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,150
come back to what you did before we also

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,950
now have a screen capture feature so up

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,960
in the top right if you want to create

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,149
just a regular video

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,950
won't be able to change the view angle

00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,960
at a later date but this is if you want

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,380
to send a quick video to someone tweet

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:43,340
it whatever it is you do with videos

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:45,020
that's available to you now a new plugin

00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,700
so as I mentioned if you can write a

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:51,890
plug-in you can change anything in the

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:53,600
world within Gazebo these are really

00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:55,970
powerful tools to help you control

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,340
either the back end or even the front

00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,899
end and the example there's a little

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,279
plugin on the top of the slide the

00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:05,929
blinking Halloween plugin the there's a

00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,350
buoyancy plug-in if you're working with

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:11,659
underwater devices an elevator plugin

00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,299
this whole presentation was made using a

00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,980
GUI overlay plug-in so you can see that

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,529
it's a really powerful tool to help you

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:24,620
control gazebo and get it to really fit

00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:26,149
your particular use case we've also

00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,980
spent a lot of effort on hardware

00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:31,370
integration so if you have an oculus or

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,899
Apple Hemus 3d classes you can use those

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,640
and it's a great way to kind of bridge

00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:37,010
the gap between simulation in the real

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,240
world you can use these gadgets and

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,360
control what's happening in the

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,090
simulated world with your physical body

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,270
which is pretty neat the top photo is an

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:49,010
example of a demo we did for the DARPA

00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:51,620
Robotics Challenge that's using an

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,289
oculus and a Razer Hydra and the bottom

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,700
is the Polhemus with 3d glasses and you

00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,159
can see on the screen in that image

00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,429
we're using a GUI overlay plugin for

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,860
that project there's a custom custom GUI

00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:06,649
on the left side and the arm that's

00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:09,080
being simulated is a prosthetic that was

00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:11,120
being tested for use on folks with

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,309
transradial amputation

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,230
yeah so it's a great example of how

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:21,710
plugins and hardware integration can

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:24,590
work together and we're doing great on

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,029
time so what's next those are some of

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,929
the new features we weren't able to go

00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:33,380
over everything but we had whoops that

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:35,090
was kind of a grapevine so we have some

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,970
GUI specific features that we're working

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,620
on one is a terrain editor so you'll be

00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,500
able to within the GUI create a

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,780
customized terrain we're working on a

00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,360
visual redesigns well

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,400
if you notice the plotting utility had a

00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,610
much different look and feel that was

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,690
based on the Google's material design so

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,420
we're slowly moving in that direction

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:58,120
that was kind of a prototype just to get

00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,420
a more cohesive look across the whole

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,040
system we're working on a GUI console as

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,040
well that'll help you with debugging

00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,480
within the GUI and graphical inertial

00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,820
resizing so if you remember the pink

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,650
boxes Louise showed you that represent

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,810
the inertia on the introspection tools

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,790
you'll be able to if it's too big or too

00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:18,730
small you'll be able to drag it to get

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:21,460
it to be more what you want it to be so

00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,760
you can quickly tweak your tweak your

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,140
robot that way or your models that way

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,690
we'll also be adding graphical tools for

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,480
physics validation and a bunch of other

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:34,030
stuff on the non GUI side we're working

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,040
on Prop Shop integration and prop shop

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,320
is an online database of models so you

00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,290
can share your models and download other

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,180
people's models that they've contributed

00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,460
it'll help let you have a wider variety

00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,780
of models to use within simulation it's

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:51,790
gonna be a really cool thing

00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,500
there's cloud sound classroom and GZ web

00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,750
you'll hear more about those later

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,250
ian is giving a talk on that but at a

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,750
high level if you couldn't guess it from

00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,410
the name clouds and lets you run

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:06,060
simulations in the cloud will be working

00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:09,180
on improving SDF and you RDF support and

00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,830
working on adding deformable shapes

00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:13,810
there's a complete list of the roadmap I

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,900
think its gazebo sim that org slash

00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:19,000
roadmap something like that status slash

00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:22,930
status if you're interested you can look

00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,090
there so you may be thinking at this

00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:28,780
point how do I get me some gazebo and

00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,700
the answer is on this slide I'm sure you

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,520
all know that each Ross version ships

00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,290
with a particular version of gazebo but

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,670
it's possible if you follow that link to

00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,850
make your own combination so if you

00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:43,810
don't want to switch to a different Ross

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:46,140
distribution you can customize it and

00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:47,980
get a newer version of gazebo working

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,810
it's also important to note that

00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,190
starting with gazebo seven the current

00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,810
release we're now synced with the Ross

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:57,429
releases so it'll be easier for you to

00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:58,309
stay up to date so here we have some

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:00,679
reason

00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:03,260
if you want to learn more those folks

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,720
down there are the Gazebo team at open

00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,130
source robotics foundation but again

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,320
there are contributors from all over the

00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:11,960
world and if you check out that QR code

00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:15,830
if you're into that you can get our

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,929
links to the slides and with that we

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:22,240
have more time than expected for

00:31:17,929 --> 00:31:22,240
questions thank you for your attention

00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,470
so we'll we've got a few minutes for

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,450
questions there are three mics in the

00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,550
room left center and right please go to

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,380
a mic because we're gonna record and

00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:40,380
broadcast the questions for the audience

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:48,160
and your last slide you showed that

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,640
there's a gazebo wrap gazebo wrappers so

00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,320
for example if I'm using indigo and

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,530
currently gazebo - can I jump to gazebo

00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:59,620
seven and integrated there yes if you

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:01,900
check this link there is a tutorial on

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:17,070
how to make a ear combination of

00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:20,770
versions all right we'll we'll all

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:23,160
plugins be focused on C++ or there will

00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:26,640
there be options for other languages

00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:30,420
right now we only support C++ plugins

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,420
maybe in the future there will be

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:45,430
represented or it efan tastic will you

00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:48,460
support importing from yeah we support

00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:51,370
you can bring your COLLADA files or STL

00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:55,840
files we're also starting to work on obj

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:58,030
files as well but not the whole the

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,440
whole set up like a SolidWorks model

00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:01,840
with all the links in joints you can

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,630
think for the whole thing at once yet

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:17,620
but just the mesh is to use in your

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:20,230
model yes it's there it on the subject

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,390
of the model editor if I were to want to

00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:25,420
bring in a model and tune it and then

00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:30,040
run it again for repeatability can I

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:33,250
save to an SDF file or export that or is

00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,920
that something you have Road mapped it

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,540
currently it saves in SDF there's

00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,669
current it currently doesn't save into

00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:42,830
you or IDF yet but as the eff that's the

00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:46,759
the format we're exporting it cool thank

00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:49,730
you I have to say that was a super cool

00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:52,159
presentation and totally awesome to run

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,980
the whole thing is evil amazing the

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,659
question I have is we do a lot of multi

00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,299
robot systems and we record a ton of

00:33:56,659 --> 00:34:00,950
bags and typically if we have a problem

00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:04,100
we're visualizing it after the fact by

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,899
playing the bag into our biz and I'm

00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,179
wondering if there was some kind of way

00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:12,139
that we could synchronize multiple bags

00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,639
and then reconstruct and use gazebo is

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,990
an after-the-fact visualizer for

00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,579
something that took place in the real

00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:21,589
world and so I'm wondering how how kind

00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:24,859
of accessible the data format is that

00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:27,079
you're using for that playback scheme so

00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:31,520
the format that we record the log files

00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:33,700
right now it's in SDF it's a state it's

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,669
a state stack that we record

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:40,010
periodically I have never seen anyone

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:42,559
converting for from Rose bags to Gazebo

00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,460
log files but maybe there's some people

00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,099
doing it already

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,740
you can't play Rose bag directly into

00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:50,599
gazebo unfortunately but yeah just like

00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,740
a Siebel log files themselves we'll

00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:58,849
definitely the killer app is the

00:34:51,740 --> 00:35:02,059
scrubber I mean that's are there any

00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:05,799
plans to allow for import from common

00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:08,960
slam packages so basically Ross Maps

00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:12,799
importing from Rose Maps yeah any of the

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,280
various Ross map formats more simply

00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:17,839
than a building editor I'd say yeah I

00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,829
don't know if we have any plans for this

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:26,030
I don't think we do thank you thing

00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:28,549
hello I have more of like 200 requests

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,200
have questions one of them regards the

00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:32,180
API of the code I know that there's been

00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,400
a lot of changes and that it wraps

00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,470
around different physics engines but I

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,900
see some inconsistency in things like

00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,369
you can do different supposedly

00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,799
different functions do the same thing

00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:44,540
but actually documentation kind of likes

00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:45,980
and you need to trial and error all of

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,450
them until you actually realize which

00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,520
one works in this version is not

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,250
yesterday is that plans to kind of get

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,740
finally cleaned up

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,359
yes the question was about the API and

00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,329
some inconsistencies and documentation

00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,950
with the API and inconsistencies on what

00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:03,619
the documentation say and what they

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:05,540
calls actually do or something like this

00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:07,549
yeah that's unfortunately something we

00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,700
are aware of and that we are actively

00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:13,190
trying to work and most of the features

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,260
that are there there are not documented

00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:17,569
well it's because also they are not very

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,069
tested very well so yeah we would

00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:22,940
recommend you use the calls that are

00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:30,170
more better documented because those are

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:34,069
also better tested can you talk a little

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:36,140
bit closer yeah sorry when you just kill

00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:50,329
gazebo with control-c just make it close

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:51,859
faster noted hi might I say that I speak

00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:53,839
for everyone in the audience when I say

00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:55,700
Wow wonderful presentation you got going

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,160
there and I can't wait to get myself

00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,410
some gazebo so what Evers wondering was

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,089
you know what kind of a bug reporting

00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,770
and passing up system have you got in

00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:09,170
case the users experience some kind of

00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:11,839
bugs or errors with gazebo bug reporting

00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,869
so currently we have a gazebo is hosted

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,760
on bitbucket and we have our that they

00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:18,710
issue tracker there so you can report

00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,400
bugs there there's also gazebo answers

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,329
which the link is here which is more for

00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,849
questions and answers kind of like raw

00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:27,440
sensors as well but yeah most of the bug

00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:28,880
reporting happens through night all

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:36,710
right thank you good to know I wanted to

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:39,710
get awesome presentation hi Dan LOFAR

00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:44,510
from George Mason University a question

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:46,579
about your simulation time sometimes my

00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:50,119
calculations require a longer than your

00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:54,650
time step is there a way to trigger your

00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,299
next same time update yes from a plague

00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,400
from a world plug-in you can basically

00:37:56,299 --> 00:38:01,880
kind of run the world in paused mode and

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,940
call the update yourself at every

00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:08,390
iteration as fast as you want

00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:11,180
what distro was that released with I

00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:13,240
believe this works with most visible

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,850
versions don't quote me on that

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,200
thank you a great presentation I think

00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,030
you're giving Prezi a run for their

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,010
money

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:25,460
I was just curious has anyone tried to

00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,830
run like simulated production line like

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:34,420
for example like manufacturing a car or

00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:36,860
something or is it possible well

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,870
personally we haven't seen a full

00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:41,180
production line being simulated we've

00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:43,850
seen individual industrial arms with

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:45,230
conveyor belts there is even when a

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,240
couple of them in the video that we

00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,440
showed but I've never seen the whole

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,560
production line that would be really

00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,560
