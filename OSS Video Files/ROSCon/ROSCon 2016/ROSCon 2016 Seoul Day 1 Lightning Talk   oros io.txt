hi everyone so great to be here so I am

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,820
the co-founder of hizmet robotics and we

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,380
want we've been working on a project

00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,400
that we want to share with you today and

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,160
it's called orous I oh so it's a web

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,189
platform or to help you create Ross

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:27,480
system so let's take a look so you can

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:29,849
create Ross system by adding nodes by

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,690
describing your system with notes you

00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:38,309
can hide your whole notes you can remap

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,500
the topics just by matching the the

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,460
blocks you can hedge it you you are the

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,649
F driving to directly online and finally

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,140
you export your system as a roast

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,120
package and you just launch it on your

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,910
machine so this is just the beginning

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,010
Russell is not just a graphical

00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,260
interface to Russ it will be a full

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,070
development environment for robotics

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,820
based on Russ in the future you will be

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,470
able to use a rocio to create robot

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,420
application from software selection

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:19,439
choose the user interface generation so

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,850
how can you help us a Russell is in

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,810
better it's online so you can go on the

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,420
website and request an invitation so

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,900
give it a try give us feedback we really

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,900
