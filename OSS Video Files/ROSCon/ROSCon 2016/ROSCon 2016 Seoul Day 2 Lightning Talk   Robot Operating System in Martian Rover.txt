okay hello everyone I'm Sonic logic I'm

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,470
student of agh university of science and

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,639
technology in krakow and member of agh

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,549
space system scientific club I'm bro

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,680
glad to be here today and I want to say

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,740
that we found drawers very useful in our

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,300
project especially in a Martian rover

00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:23,340
project designed for european /

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,490
challenge that's why I want to read say

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,349
thank you the whole community our first

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,269
rubber Phobos has a rocker buggy

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,790
suspension known for example from

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,640
curiosity rubber its motor drivers

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,430
communicate via can interface and can be

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,960
added or removed without any effort we

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,989
used two onboard computers Raspberry Pi

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,309
for communication and control and laptop

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,710
for stereo vision and visual odometry we

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,960
started everything from simulation in

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,860
gazebo at the beginning it was only a

00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:01,489
simple box with bottle with few

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:10,110
cylinders as a wheels now as you can see

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:13,710
it's quite a big model oh yeah currently

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,170
we can simulate Robert dynamics motors

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,200
controllers encoders IMU cameras

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,689
particularly everything we need to fully

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,880
test and develop our software with this

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,220
simulation we tested external Kalman

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,110
filter visual odometry will

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,890
automatically IM you before rubber could

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:36,299
even drive through we used RVs to

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,090
visualize 8a data from a free freedom

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:45,299
app from stereo vision and the rubber

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:48,659
position and post of its joints we used

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,280
ross also for estimating loads according

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,159
in joints in this simulation we wrote

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,560
the plugin which estimated those loads

00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,350
during traveling in rough terrain and we

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,990
use those data later in FEM simulation

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,729
we also create a plug-in to simulate

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,009
differential mechanism with two PD

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,470
controllers as it's not possible in

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,330
order to create a close kinematic chains

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,510
I know it's not perfect solution but it

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,970
just works

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,700
we used ross also in our vision system

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,890
as we got some failure with our

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,110
fpga-based camera drivers one week

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,500
before competition we had two really

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,790
fast create a new solution and this was

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,620
for nano pi microcomputers streaming a

00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:38,250
image from USB cameras via ethernet

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,780
network and we froze this was as easy as

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,700
exporting cross master very last thing i

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,560
want to say is that i learned rose

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,569
during in their internships in robotics

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,580
inventions company if not day out

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,030
probably never learn trust and never

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,950
bring it to my team that's why i want to

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,290
really encourage everyone to promote

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,480
rose in student society because it's

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,760
still underestimated and not well known

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,120
on many university thank you and see you

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,120
