thank you Brian so hi everyone my name

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,020
is Ian I'm a software engineer at OS RF

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,820
and I work on simulations and today the

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,510
title of my talk is cloudy with a chance

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,070
of simulation so as you may have guessed

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,670
I'm going to talk to you about cloud

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,800
simulations a little bit of history here

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,980
what are we doing simulations on the

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,420
cloud so it goes back to the DA para

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,980
virtualized challenge which happened in

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,660
2013 it happened before the DARPA

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,160
Robotics Challenge so this is the VRC

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,559
where the competition happened in

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,539
simulation so we were asked to create

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:51,300
this online centralized platform for

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,539
teens from around the world to join in

00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,520
and compete in simulation so they had to

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,879
control the simulated Atlas robot to

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,340
perform various tasks like driving a

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,299
vehicle walking on even terrain and also

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,210
manipulating tools so this win will

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,390
return to cloud technology and it's also

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:16,020
when the first cloud simulation to was

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,360
born it was called claussen so with the

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,090
use of cloud soon we were able to launch

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,610
hundreds of machines on the cloud and

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,159
provision them without software which is

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,560
gazebo and Ross and then give them to

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,130
the teams to use the practice and also

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:37,280
we use them for the competition so

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,380
claussen with Carlson the VRC went well

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,950
so and more recently we being approached

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,380
by different other groups they come to

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:51,390
us and then they also want to host and

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,740
run competitions so here just a few so

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,979
we have the space robotics challenge

00:01:52,740 --> 00:02:00,960
it's coming up SRC that's been recently

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,759
announced so so the competition involves

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,280
this Valkyrie robot will be performing

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,259
some repair tasks in space in simulation

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,200
of course the nature of the competition

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,870
is somewhat similar to the VRC where you

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,380
have one primary robot doing stuff in

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,290
similar

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,540
and then in the middle you have the a

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,650
gel robotics for industrial automation

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,870
competition area that involves aur robot

00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,710
in a more industrial warehouse like

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,150
sitting so in this competition the robot

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,080
will be fully autonomous there will be

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,690
no remote operator interaction and down

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,780
the bottom there is a comin swamp

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,610
competition as hasn't been announced yet

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,340
but i'll just give you a little bit of

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,650
details so in this competition is the

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,630
setup where there are two teams swarms

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,830
and they will be doing stuff in

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:55,500
simulation and so all these projects are

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,320
very exciting as we learn more and more

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,110
about them we found out they're actually

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,000
quite a few different requirements like

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,550
how the competition will be run who will

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,350
be running the simulations and how we're

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:14,400
going to get the user code up to these

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:16,590
machines on the cloud so so that is also

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,320
one of the main reasons why we're

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:23,010
looking into developing a new Kyle

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:27,150
simulation tool so let's go Klaus in bio

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,870
we're actively working on it and the

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,420
plan is that by some time by the end of

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,490
this year or early next year we have

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,530
something ready for the participants of

00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:46,020
these competitions to actually use and

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:48,959
practice so so what's near in the new

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,120
claussen tool so the goals are still the

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,970
same one to have a set of tools to help

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,300
us launch simulations and manage them on

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,860
the clown but underneath the hood we

00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,530
actually wrote everything from the

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,190
ground up one of the main reasons for

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,870
that is because over the past 23 years

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,060
we observe that the web and cloud

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,520
technology has evolved quite a bit and

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,160
really want to take advantage of all

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,090
these new tools out there so we decided

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,660
to write everything from scratch a quick

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,100
overview of the architecture so on the

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,620
front end we're started building these

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,580
web components so we looked at all these

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,250
different

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,340
and all the requirements that we have

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,439
and then we identify a set of

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,240
functionalities you I functionality that

00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,400
could be shared between all these

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,680
projects and then we turn them indeed

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,240
these generic reusable web components

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,449
that we can use to quickly piece

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:50,099
together a new UI for different special

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:51,900
projects and on the back end so we're

00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:54,180
moving away from more of a centralized

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,909
approach to a more distributed one we

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,039
split up the backend server into

00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,870
multiple servers so now we have an

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,669
authentication server we have servers

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,560
who are launching machines where the

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,830
server's who are managing tasks that are

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,479
running on the machines so I can see

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,819
here is that we're taking more of a

00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,110
bottom-up approach we create all these

00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,699
building blocks that we can take to

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,900
quickly put together and make

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,909
specialized web applications for

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,340
different projects and hopefully all

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:25,259
these tools will be a mature enough

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,180
later on and will be released all to the

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:32,009
public in fact they're all open source

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:34,050
right now you can download them the next

00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,960
one is flexible configuration of machine

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:40,740
instances so back in the VRC everything

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:44,069
has fixed cluster of machines to work

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,509
with they get a simulator and they get a

00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:47,669
couple of few computers that's where

00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,800
they deploy the code so the walking

00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:52,440
controllers notion planning perception

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,599
whatever and then we have a router to

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,759
route traffic but we in the new upcoming

00:05:54,599 --> 00:06:01,229
cousin we want to make that as flexible

00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:04,080
as possible so 11 users to be able to

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:05,550
just launch any type of machines can it

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,580
can be simulations it can be few

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,919
computers and then let them group them

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,759
into together into one like virtual

00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,800
private network we also support resource

00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,529
sharing so you can share your machine

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,169
instances like you will share a Google

00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:24,900
Doc for example and we also let them

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,849
share on the simulation level so

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,180
sometimes you don't necessarily want to

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:32,310
give users access to your machine you

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,560
but you want to invite them to join you

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,240
in the simulation all right so you can

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
they cannot ssh a machine they can

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,100
actually machine but they can come in

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,120
and

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,340
interact with you in simulation and then

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,700
we're looking for different ways to help

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:54,990
improve the process of getting user code

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:57,780
up on to the machine instances so here

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,510
quickly going over their front end so as

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,940
mentioned before we're helping lots of

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:06,740
lots of web components some of the key

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,910
ones are highlighted here in green and

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,490
the web components on the front and

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,190
talks directly to the backend so there's

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,110
no central place to route requests so

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,870
for example on the top right you have

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,640
the component for logging in it talks

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,610
directly to the authentication server

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,980
and once you're authenticated get a

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,720
token and with that token you can do

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,160
stuff like laundry machines by talking

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,600
to the portal server in the middle and

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,450
at this point in time you have one

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,150
machine running in the cloud but it's

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,340
idle nothing exciting is happening so we

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,040
support this notion of creating and

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,600
loading tasks on to the machines so then

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,020
on the bottom there and we have a widget

00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,730
for creating simulation tasks so these

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,570
tasks would be things like for example

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:57,810
Ross launched my gazebo with an empty

00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:00,000
world or for example and so with this

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,820
widget you can load various tasks onto

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,440
the machine instances we have a server

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,600
to manage it and then when you run it

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,510
just execute that command and then

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:15,900
brings up gazebo or any other your Ross

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:17,970
launched groups so just quick overview

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,760
of their workflow so you login you get a

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,350
token which is very common these days

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,680
with the coke and has your User Profile

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,990
use it to talk to the portal to launch

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,940
machine it will verify if you have

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,810
permission to launch a machine if you do

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,700
we launched a machine for you and then

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,830
once the machine is up and running you

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,770
can start creating tasks and once

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,380
everything is up and running we can get

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:46,380
status back over WebSockets so you can

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,810
see that your machine is as running is

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,350
being terminated as terminated or as if

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,649
it's in the arrow state

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:59,550
and the next feature I want to talk

00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:01,290
about security groups so what what

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,709
security groups are just basically

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,779
control the traffic between instances on

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:09,779
the cloud so we're going to show you

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,880
this with respect to a conveying swamp

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:15,120
competition which motivated us to add

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,649
this feature in the first place so in

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
the swamp competition we have this set

00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:21,720
up so we have the blue team and we have

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
on the left we have the go team on the

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,889
right and then they need to interact

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,139
with the simulator and then we also want

00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,670
to prevent them from listening on each

00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,860
other so we want to prevent cheating

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,389
right so we wanted to make this

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,149
configuration to set up as easy as

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,550
possible so what the for this is

00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,680
intended for competition admins so what

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,740
I can do now is just create a group

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,420
called blue and then you launch your

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,310
instances in the group we have default

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,720
configuration set up so that all the

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,579
machines in on the same group will be

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,399
able to communicate with one another and

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:58,680
then the other need to do next is just

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,279
create a rule that says I want to allow

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,500
incoming traffic from the simulator of

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,930
the simulation group and then we open up

00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,800
all the necessary ports for that to

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,110
happen and now you have the machines in

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,660
the brew group you can now subscribe and

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:20,790
publish to topics advertised by the

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:23,100
simulator and with that I would like to

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:33,050
just show a live demo of some of the

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:37,410
features i've been talking about so

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,930
again we are actively working on calcine

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,850
and this is the current landing page and

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:46,470
i'm going to show things like laundry

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:52,259
machines and shearing machines so i'm

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:57,019
going to login as an admin we're using

00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,019
our zero for allocation service provider

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:07,310
by the way this is our dev server

00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:12,230
running somewhere in the US and here we

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:15,500
have a very simple UI we expect the UI

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:19,250
to be to evolve quite a bit and where as

00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,320
we add more features to us so you can

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,720
see in the middle we have a rigid widget

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,120
to launch machines and there are a few

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,829
options to choose from and down on the

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,930
bottom we have already have a machine

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:31,430
running so I started it before the

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,579
presentation I'm going to use it very

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:37,880
soon but here i just want to show you

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:39,949
the process of launching a machine just

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:45,170
hit lunch yet some notification down

00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:46,970
there and a new entry appears and has a

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,310
status that it's launching so the

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:53,029
machines being brought up somewhere on

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:57,139
amazon in the west coast oregon i think

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:59,660
and then we get the IP address here so

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,730
now the machine is booting up we have we

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,519
just to create these simulation tasks

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:07,279
that i talked about we observed that

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:09,440
actually takes around a minute or so for

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,899
the computer to fully boot up so that's

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,970
why I had the Machine down here on the

00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:19,430
bottom that's ready to go and with this

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:21,800
I wanted to show you creating tasks so I

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:26,570
click the Add button and I already have

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:29,089
a demo setup Jesus demo I will add the

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:35,000
task and for now we just execute this

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:37,010
command automatically so you see a

00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,279
spinning is running the process has

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,260
started what Jeezy demo is just it

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:53,959
brings up gazebo with an empty one very

00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:56,810
very simple demo and with this hopefully

00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:01,010
the internet connection allows and now

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:03,260
we are in our simulation so this is a

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:05,949
jeezy web for those of you haven't seen

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,880
this is our WebGL front end for gazebo

00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:10,190
has

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,930
a subset of the features as the desktop

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,400
version that doesn't have all the model

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,590
editors and building attitudes that you

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,600
saw yesterday morning those are great

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,410
features but we want to keep this as

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,970
simple as possible for now all right so

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,120
now we're in the simulation we can

00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:29,210
interact with it you can insert simple

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,860
shapes you can insert lights you can

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,610
also insert models from the model

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,280
database we're quite a few and we also

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:42,110
have a century so just like jeezy client

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,840
so I'm just gonna quickly insert a box

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,700
just to show you you can inspect them oh

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,640
yeah you also you can also configure

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:53,210
physically physics params but I'm gonna

00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:59,780
inspect this box that I just added to

00:13:53,210 --> 00:14:04,010
see the post data I guess someone also

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,840
access the simulation and it added this

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:09,200
the sphere over there yes someone was

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,880
waving their hands yeah so you can

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,380
collaborate with your team members if

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,220
you want yes yeah so we need to secure

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,460
this is something we need to add okay so

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,860
i just want to show you that everything

00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:27,530
is running up in life there's physics

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,920
running so if you rotate your cube you

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,330
can see the values here so yeah so

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,600
everything is like learning we get all

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,070
the data back over web sockets so now

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,970
you have this great simulation you want

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:45,530
to share with your friends or prevent

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:49,700
people from joining okay so I want to

00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:53,540
share with myself which is I'm just

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:58,190
going to type in my username here you

00:14:53,540 --> 00:15:00,530
can set the read/write access level so

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,400
I'm gonna add and then I'll get this

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:07,630
little notification that pops up and

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,630
then we're going to login as Ian

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:29,089
take some time all right so now I can

00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,879
see this machine died just being dead

00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:33,019
the end and has shared with me so I

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,910
don't have the widget to launch a

00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,610
machine because I'm not am but I'm a

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:42,949
just a user regular user I didn't go in

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:44,990
there and open up with GL and then so

00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:49,220
yep someone who is playing with the

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,079
cylinder over there so yeah so you can

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:56,899
see that you can now access the

00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:59,809
simulation ok so because I have write

00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:04,579
access to this machine I can just kill

00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:06,110
it and now I just say terminating and

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,930
you go back to the end in view and you

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:16,069
see that oh SI is terminating as well so

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:33,860
everything is in sync ok just got

00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:37,420
closest and that's the demo so a future

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:41,089
work so is work in progress we're

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,339
actively working on it every day there's

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:46,129
the upcoming competitions of course that

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,660
we have to get done right so the

00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:49,790
competition's require different versions

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,980
of Ross and gazebo so we want to make

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:53,509
this as easy to configure as possible

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,100
they should just be able to select the

00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:56,860
version of Ross and gazebo and then

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,300
everything should be set up for them

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,519
there's a little bit of work to do on

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,740
the web GL front-end that you just saw

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,120
we recently had a google Summer of Code

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,709
student that contributed to the inquiry

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,439
to integrate a new backend for us and

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:14,510
then now we need to work on things are

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:18,020
improving performance and stability of

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,209
GG web there's also traffic shaping

00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,890
which is a feature that we had during

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:26,160
the VRC that that has limit

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,320
bandwidth and latency between machines

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,180
we hope to bring it back and then for

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,960
the competition's we need to implement a

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,850
leaderboard but in the long term what

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,460
we're hoping to end up with just a set

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:41,280
of software libraries and packages or

00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,190
tools that for the community to use to

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,040
fold any of your cloud simulation needs

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,050
you can use all these packages to create

00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,360
your own custom calcium if you want to

00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:53,970
or you can just use a subset of these

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:59,160
tools to just launch simulations on the

00:17:53,970 --> 00:18:01,380
cloud whenever you want to so an example

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,120
there would be a GC web we've heard

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,950
quite a few groups or have started using

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,840
it which has been developed as part of

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:11,820
our cloud effort so for example in the

00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,370
next talk we have the construct we will

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,740
show probably hopefully some of their

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:20,850
sub using GC web and then they're using

00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:24,090
it to visualize their Cal simulations in

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,980
the longer term we think that simulation

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,010
long cow is generally really good for

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,620
continuous integration testing powerful

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,690
ages to spin up machines on a clown run

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,270
your tests your entire software stack

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,970
and get results back and they're for

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:41,250
things like training and education so we

00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,340
help we hope workshops before with

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,020
calcium & jeezy web then it just really

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,610
takes the hassle out of us from

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,070
preparing all these setting up all these

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,050
laptops putting him down leg putting in

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,210
our luggage carrying our luggage and

00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,650
taking it to workshop we're passing a GC

00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,560
where you can just launch machines and

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,620
then deliver your workshops for things

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:06,030
like also everything is configured for

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,910
you if you're new to Ross new to to

00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:10,500
robotics in general so you can just

00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,640
launch a machine with everything set up

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,590
for you you don't have to worry about

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,630
kicking workspace and then you focus on

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,490
learning the core about concepts right

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,640
there and then solving the actual

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,740
robotics problems another idea that pop

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,590
up recently you just have something like

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,480
interactive Ross tutorials for example

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,250
you have these code snippets you run

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,309
them immediately and then you see the

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:36,519
results as you are learning and

00:19:33,309 --> 00:20:03,490
with that that's all I have thank you

00:19:36,519 --> 00:20:06,129
very much it's not on this one's on

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,980
excellent so cloud some seems really

00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:10,600
cool if we're advanced Ross users do you

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,809
think it would be possible to have a

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,840
work space on your Ubuntu workstation

00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:20,710
and then network to cloud sem and see

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,210
the interaction between the two ah yes I

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,429
believe we can do that we can just

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:27,610
expose the right ports in for you you

00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:30,309
get an ssh key you can log on to you and

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,529
log on to it to configure it if you want

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:35,320
to manually otherwise you can just open

00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:36,909
the ports and then you can start your

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,529
roster on your local client and they

00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:52,350
connect to the Machine up on the clown

00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:52,350
