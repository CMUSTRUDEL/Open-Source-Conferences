hi my name is doing from autonomous and

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:10,290
I want to present the depleting robot

00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:14,880
demon robot is a research robot that

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:17,100
help you to be AI for your robots so

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,869
what is deep learning deep learning is a

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,410
branch of machine learning that is

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,240
extremely powerful any major tech

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,400
companies today Google or Facebook or

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,289
investing heavily in too deeply and

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,610
using it in every major project working

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,440
on right now and autonomous um we

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,860
believe that deepening is a very very

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,270
good tool for robotics and why is that

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,030
if you look at deep learning and what is

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,850
deeply is good at decent extremely

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,489
relevant to robotic community so for

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,649
example last year depleting outperforms

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,289
human level at object recognition in

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,960
this year alone a deeply an ample from

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,180
human speech recognition and a bunch of

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,410
speech and and natural language

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,760
understanding task so if I can build a

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,250
MicroBot in a way that it can outperform

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,170
or have human level as some basic tasks

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,490
at object recognition or speech

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,880
recognition on natural understand i

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,729
would love to have that um and recently

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,100
we see some progress in terms of

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:21,540
manipulation or navigation in a row up

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,090
line deep into integral buttocks to so

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,920
if deep learning is good and if we want

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,250
up like deep into robotics how do we get

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,810
started um so over about a year ago um

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,090
there wasn't anything like this on a

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,119
market um so a bunch of us about 20

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,380
engineers we build this in in-house so

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,009
that we can play around with deep

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,320
learning um into our robots so thanks to

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,960
Julian Melanie and a wonderful people at

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,909
eugene robotics with the turnabout to we

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,610
clone tool about to and we make a lot of

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:53,220
modifications on the total bot um you

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:55,920
still get the same things with to the

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,320
bar things i def camera the kabuki base

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,259
but the major contribution we do here is

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,140
that we installed the nvidia tegra k1

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:07,049
and sunnah tx1 and we fight turn these

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,280
little libraries on to these bores and

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,259
very soon we're gonna release some of

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,879
the models that we joints so out of the

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,100
box you can do things like facial

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,620
recognition after

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,030
recognition ki will be tackling speech

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,290
recognition and things like that one key

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,250
thing when we build a diamond romo is

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,200
that we want to make it really

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,050
affordable and the reason is that we

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,150
want to remove the barrier into robotics

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,950
so first we launched a product at nine

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,830
hundred ninety nine dollars and we saw

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,980
on I think today / cigarette robots in

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,360
the past six months we may be the

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,880
quantum that ship the most during the

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,380
past six months in the world and then

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,390
recently we want to make it even more

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,000
affordable so we get a financial

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,770
financial agreements so that today for

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,470
eighty eight dollars per month over 12

00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,490
months you can get a diamond robot today

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,770
and I don't think it's a lower better

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,770
