okay so you didn't know this week Google

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,469
released cartographer which is a really

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:14,429
awesome open source

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:17,220
slam library so I work for TR I and we

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:20,160
added support on our robot HSR and we

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,140
really think it's awesome so let's go

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,570
ahead and see how it works why would you

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,670
want to use why would you want to use

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:32,880
this because awesome loop closures guys

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,219
I know this is a big all right Lu this

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,210
is a big problem in slam loop closing

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,340
and also this 3d slam so what this does

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,590
is does a vertical occupancy map as well

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,360
as though as a planar occupancy map and

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,059
it's able to track up and down stairs

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,910
and through large spaces and so this is

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,789
from the joist museum and Google's also

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,100
real also going to release three years

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,539
of data collections from this museum so

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,480
there will be a lot of data that you can

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,270
test your algorithms over and see how

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,150
well it works in comparison with this so

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,680
we can see it going around and and

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:15,479
actually doing all these loop closures

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,890
as it's going it's really awesome all

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,530
right so what do you do when you get a

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,540
new piece of code you have to test it

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,130
right so we decided at your eye that we

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,610
were gonna have a little bit fun with

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,860
this test and we were going to create

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,189
this little video showing a small

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,909
location but with a large array of

00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:38,070
dynamic dynamic things so I do want to

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,650
point out that we shot this on HSR this

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,150
is actually shot using a Ross bag so we

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,399
collected all the data including the

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,990
camera data and we went through our

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,110
little lab which is set of like a mock

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,310
kitchen and a Rumaki livingroom home and

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,049
we did a whole bunch of fun things so

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,880
we're testing out like things that are

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,950
statically dynamic like chairs in the

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,049
background things that move around that

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,469
the lighter catches like drawers that

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,020
move out in your kitchen making sure

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,270
that things like doorways this is our

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,610
doorway here or lighter is low on our

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,640
robot that that's not messing

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,580
the the slam algorithm you can see all

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,670
the all the edges of this map are kept

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,260
for really straight and high higher

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,910
dynamic things like lolling around on

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,100
chairs actually don't really get added

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,570
at all and so this is the last portion

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,940
that we're going through here is moving

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,130
the chairs back and forth it actually

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,780
sees these chairs twice so they have a

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,250
high probability of being there but as

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,220
the robot is going through you see they

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,320
start to fade out and then once the

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,090
robot hits the end of the room and it

00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,280
realizes that a loop closure has

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:49,880
happened all of the chairs go back to

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,930
actually where they currently are so yeh

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,700
you should actually watch it with the

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,459
music there's fun music involved it

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,200
looks much more like an okay go video

00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:59,190
okay so here's the thing you should take

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
a picture of if you're gonna take a

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,630
picture go get the code it's on github

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,810
it has HSR and turtlebot support correct

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,209
currently you can also use the code at

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,330
RoboCup at home HSR and droids you're

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,330
