hello to every gram my name is Alejandra

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,510
and a and a robotic engineer at the

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,759
robotics and today we'll talk you about

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,790
the robot blog Lee package programming

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,060
rows with blocks it's the first time

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,820
that the robotics acetal here in the

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,240
ruskin so let me tell you some words

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,519
about our company the Italian robotics

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,760
going to simplify robots and artificial

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,500
intelligent creation and to do so we

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,410
build the next generation of artificial

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,540
robotic brains so you have interests

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,360
about this world please don't miss the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,820
talk about my colleague Victor morale

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,280
which is going to present today it was

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,300
last relevant work about the hardware

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,969
robot operating system so let's start

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,690
with the presentation and i would like

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,340
to start talking in a little bit about

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,000
away the experience teaching robotics

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,760
and unfortunately we talk different

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,170
groups going from high school to PhD

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,220
level and how to make use of our robots

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,650
while most of the people clearly

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,930
understand the different mechanical part

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,810
of a robot understand the underlying

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,630
software is something that took quite a

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,880
bit of a four and we're making our

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,159
training session one of the first thing

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,909
we try to introduce is the concept of

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,729
ross while there are many resources of

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,090
this topic it is a fact that Reni Rose

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,100
take Sonny for so we start with type in

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,920
some ideas to make this process as

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,560
simple as possible so this may cast

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,500
looking into system like scratch for

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,159
robot programming and the output of this

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,509
prototype has become robot blockley a

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,159
multi-platform web-based tool for

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,689
priming robots and rods that use Ross

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,619
but we are going to start step by step

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,869
and first at all this this work has been

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,350
inspired by scratch which is a visual

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,149
programming language this mean that we

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,340
are not going to see any code we are

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:12,030
only going to program with with blocks

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,510
so a scratch for design in 2003 as an

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,319
educational ramen

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,700
which by the mid-30s primarily designed

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:27,519
for a 2 18 year old but it's also used

00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:29,530
by people of all ages so this is blog

00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,470
Lee which is the second ward off of the

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:35,170
package and blog Lee is the efforts of

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,239
Google to just from scratch in a quest

00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,659
based application so it's hello with

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,370
pages to include a habitual code editor

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,370
in our case we're going to use Python

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,650
because he's fully supported by Ross and

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,389
also by blockley and we don't have to

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:55,540
compile any code so this is means

00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:57,250
Resnick which is the greater of scratch

00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,220
and he thought that we shouldn't think

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,159
about young people as the done native so

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,930
jump people spend most of the time you

00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,200
see new technologies so they are really

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:11,680
comfortable unfamiliar Rosen chatting

00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,099
texting gaming but the Essene really

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,049
makes you fluent with new technologies

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,599
so jump people have a lot of experience

00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,579
interacting with new technology but lot

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,400
less of at creating and expressing

00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:26,169
themselves with new technologies as we

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,349
can see in this picture people normally

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:32,169
takes on these technologies it's almost

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:34,810
of if they could read but not write in

00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:36,190
robotics that really means that they

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:41,650
need to be able to write their own

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:43,870
computer programs or code so now I want

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:51,280
to launch a question how many people

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:53,530
here is fluent in Korean okay anyone how

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,430
many people here is P is fluent in

00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:02,650
Spanish okay how many people here is

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:06,970
fluent in Python okay as I expected most

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:10,780
people here are able to speak or to be

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,090
fluent in a parameter lenguage than in a

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,539
foreign language for example in Spain we

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,560
normally learn English at the second

00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,479
foreign language at one of the first

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,010
foreign language the second language so

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,880
in other countries so the third language

00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:26,410
normally is friends or Germany but now

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,850
aday make mix

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,430
that learn a new language a ceramic

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,710
language for example so increasingly

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,080
people are starting to recognize the

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,300
importance of learning how to code for

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,330
example the new year Mayor Mike in blue

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,610
man is taking a coding classes in

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,370
nowadays and the Estonian government has

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:54,100
a start teaching the first grader how to

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:57,730
code and normally people seen colonies

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,640
like this and and in fact if this is

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,530
what Colleen is like it will be only

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,590
narrows of community of people with the

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,910
special mathematical skills and

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,240
technology called background that can

00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:14,650
code but we need to engage new people in

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,230
programming and programming robots so by

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,930
using a scratch or in this case revolve

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,300
ugly people are able to to become fluent

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,190
with new technologies they are able to

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,140
spread their ideas with them x x para me

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,840
so for the reason we have created robot

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,450
luckily which is a ross package data

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,550
user to create rows based algorithms and

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,430
behaviors as tracks in its complexity

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,410
using blogs the end of this package is

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,050
to hide the complexity of programming

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:59,050
rows of Roman robot sorry we are

00:05:44,050 --> 00:06:00,580
functional blocks so so this is robot

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,950
blog limb as you can see here we have

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:09,270
different buttons just to launch the

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:13,300
gold or safe or load your blocks and we

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:16,510
bottom we can see the block in this is

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:21,820
that this first block blocks are in

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:26,080
general blogs like variables or this

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:29,770
teen romance loops function and so many

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,640
things okay this is quite simple to use

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,789
this block that's all the dragon are

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,880
moving the interface right in the in the

00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:40,090
top of sending in the below of the Adobe

00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,260
me

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,180
we can see the supported robot and in

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:51,400
this case we can see the block that for

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,110
example is done up early spider for

00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,740
example at the brain that contain a

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,570
calibration for the sensor or just

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,210
different kind of algorithm like a star

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:11,199
different Chile lasers or aslam

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:13,870
algorithms okay so he will take a look

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,360
to the architecture of robot blog lee we

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,690
have two different sides in one side we

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,720
have the front end which is the

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,419
interfaith siu in the last slide which

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,580
is right all in javascript and HTML and

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:28,780
in the other side we have the back end

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,970
with contain the logic of the

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,530
application and this logic is going to

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,860
understand the blocks that we have

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,199
create in the in the front end and

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:42,070
substitute this block by a python code

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,260
on or in this case ross code and we have

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,270
two main folders one is blocked with

00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,850
contain the shape of all of the blocks

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,039
that blockley contains on the other one

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,470
is generate doors that can take the

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,400
python code of with it's going to be

00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:00,190
linked with the block and if we think

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,639
about the workflow is it's just simple

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:06,490
yeah we only need to to build our own

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,800
blogs just dragging a moving blocks we

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,690
are going to lounge we are going to

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,760
click in the button and the block is

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,520
going to send back to the logic with a

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,169
web socket and the logic is going to

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:23,200
take care about everything there was no

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:25,620
topics action or whatever and the back

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,990
in all the time is sent to the front end

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:31,770
the state of the of the block so we are

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:36,940
we are be able to see which blog is

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:44,320
executing its time so if we take a look

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:49,560
to the structure is here okay auroville

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,110
luckily i have my pork here is the code

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,779
right so it's a common

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,920
Ross package you can see the cmake least

00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:02,430
txt on the package dot XML here the main

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,190
folder is the front end so here we have

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,959
a build this package is right on

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,870
JavaScript and it's able to highlight

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:15,560
the code in the in the browser and also

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:18,149
the blog view folder is the blocks

00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:24,269
generator so if we go to the blocks

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:27,390
folder sorry we can see here the

00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:30,290
different robots that are the rubber and

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:37,620
spider in the brain so we open one

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:39,360
example rubber is licensed right and you

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,269
can see the JavaScript code that

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,490
generate the shape right so this is

00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:47,190
quite simple in the following slides we

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:51,930
are going to see how can we create this

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:57,920
kind of things and in the generators

00:09:51,930 --> 00:10:00,420
file folder sorry we can select the the

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,820
primary language in this kind in this

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,980
case is Python write scripts and also we

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:14,459
are going to select over again on for

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:16,230
example the mode so this is the code

00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,420
that is going to be substituted by the

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,230
block that change them out of of the

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:24,990
robot you can see is Ross code is quite

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:31,800
simple and I think it's really easy to

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:33,390
create your own blocks okay so if you

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,100
like to create your own blog you don't

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,339
have to know about hava scrip if you

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,899
don't know we have an interface is the

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:43,949
saying I blockley you can drag and move

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:46,260
different blocks to the definition box

00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:48,720
and in the preview in the top right of

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,480
the image we can see the preview of the

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,390
block that we are in creating so in the

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,250
language code we are going to see the

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:01,260
JavaScript code that we have to include

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:04,380
in the block folder and the last one box

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,040
they generated or box is going to be

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,110
your Rosco you have to write

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,399
they're your Ross code and include in

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,920
the generated or file so I have some

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,769
recommendation for you the first one is

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,810
to use what spy wait for message because

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,940
you have to be sure that we have to

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,910
receive the data from Napoli share in

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,620
the code block so if we use call back we

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,899
are not completely sure that you are

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,620
receiving data in this code block and

00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:35,350
also you have to check all the thing

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:38,440
about Ross is the if the Rose knows it

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:41,009
land and the topics because the the user

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:48,819
that use the front end don't care about

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:52,389
the rose okay so let's see what can we

00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:55,329
program with robot blockley so in this

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:57,490
example we got early spider with other

00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,800
brain the top with a camera so we are

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,480
going to show the red color to the

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,779
spider and the spider is going to turn

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,569
to the right or to the left if if the

00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:10,000
spider see the color so you can see how

00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:12,850
the code with these security is

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,970
highlighted and also with I don't know

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:19,300
20 or 15 blocks we are able to create a

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:23,500
behavior not so complete but enough to

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:26,079
move on spider so in this other example

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,930
we have a respite again with a chilly

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,380
laser and we create an algorithm to move

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,949
around amazed so again you can see that

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,170
with only 20 blocks we are able to move

00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:40,630
the spider so just imagine that just in

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,459
one day or in few hours you are able to

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,370
move a spider using Ross so you don't

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:47,769
know nothing about rose but you are able

00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:51,329
to move the spiders and ottoman robots

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:54,610
in this case and anything is really cool

00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:57,670
so in the first two blocks we can

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,699
calibrate the IMU of the spider and also

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:06,459
star the delay sir of of the of the

00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:11,160
spider so just if you flip you sorry few

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:13,709
blocks and just to move a row

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,699
and the last sample is a little bit more

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:20,220
more complex and yes is executing also

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:22,860
the same algorithm that we have before

00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,579
in the others example but now we are

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,560
able to create an Islam algorithm so the

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:33,329
interface was blog Lee allows you to see

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:36,540
the map that the spider is generating so

00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:41,189
again with few blocks just add in the

00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,779
the green loop we are able to create a

00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:45,180
map so if in jello you can see the

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,220
initial position of the spider and in

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:57,000
the purple curve you are able to see the

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:59,610
path of the spider in the world so to

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,319
conclude my presentation this kind of

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,930
package make it easy how to teach

00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:06,329
robotics and also make accessible

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,449
robotics for people who don't have

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:12,209
priming skills so make it easy this this

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:16,699
in turn on this wall and many people can

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:19,589
ask me that okay there are so many other

00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:22,139
solution to to program with blocks and I

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,089
say yes but for example LabVIEW or

00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,240
simulink but they are not easily

00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:28,740
extensible and also our proprietary so

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,389
that is menial you have to pay a licen

00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,639
enroll ugly is string so nowadays we are

00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:38,310
not the only one who who build their own

00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,529
robot log grip blogs there are companies

00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,779
like sell robotics building its own blog

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:46,230
to move the manipulator this how

00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:47,970
manipulators and I think one of the most

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,459
important thing here is license which is

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,670
open source license under GPL version 3

00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:56,100
so if you are you have interestin on

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:58,709
these you come for the code and start

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,230
prototyping your ideas or prototype in

00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:03,480
your blogs to make this more bigger and

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,889
you don't have the bandwidth of you

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,439
don't have the knowledge do this theme

00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:10,920
you can reach us out or hide us to help

00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:13,170
you during the process so are you ready

00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,629
to jump into robotics become a

00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,629
roboticist priming with blocks thank you

00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:37,730
no question breathing clear if I have a

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,829
cast and ropa how can I I mean not like

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:45,019
your spider or something how can I use

00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:49,220
this interface okay speak a little bit

00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:52,010
older if I have a cast on how we're not

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,170
not not the highway this I can I input a

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,060
model inside but you will like to

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,040
include your own robot you mean yeah

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,730
yeah it's questionable you only have two

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,370
particle and enjoy build your own

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,649
blocked so I explained that you have the

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,779
code the blocks and your rate or files

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:12,680
so you only have to include your coat in

00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:15,740
this to file to folder and just include

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:18,440
your own hardware oh so so no need to

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,430
making like the i/o between the rocks

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,220
and be in terrific louder please like so

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,010
so don't know need the like mapping the

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:31,730
i/o between our robot highway and the

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,290
proc sprockie and so you can include the

00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,320
robot that you will like you only have

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:39,680
to program your heart will I make my

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,990
hardware and yes you can get your house

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,000
or your robot and you can include in a

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,390
Broadway you'll have to include the

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,579
section of your robot and media pull

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:56,959
requests to the main repository okay

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:59,570
thank you hi um I was curious on the

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,950
interface you had with the mapping what

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,250
other kind of extensions might you have

00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:07,010
where you can visualize other

00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,800
representations of information to the to

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,970
the students or to the user are you

00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:17,750
using Oh machinery you're using for that

00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:20,630
but the question is that how you're

00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:22,339
exposing some of the topics or not we're

00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,230
not watching the topic what is PO the

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,540
information that is useful for the user

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,309
for example in the case of the Islam we

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,100
only see them up on the position of the

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:33,290
robot so you you'll know nothing about

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,450
the topics and this thing because he's

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,059
hidden

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:41,019
because of the blocks is that done in

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:43,720
the browser no topics are a note are not

00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:45,669
disposed in the browser okay I was just

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,799
talking about the visualization because

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:50,139
the people or the person who write the

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:53,260
blog's have to take care about topics I

00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:55,710
note the user don't need to know about

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,710
this

00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,460
