I want to present our develop lagging

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,269
about simulating the Robocop sucker

00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,230
human environment robocop soccer

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,020
simulator has been developed since 2006

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,369
and has been used since 2006 however

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,789
there is a lack of accuracy in

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,640
assimilating the humanoid robots the

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,570
roll call simulator is used in the

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,890
humanoid simulation of the Robocop and

00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,990
instead of using the Robocop simulator

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,730
we try to use the gazebo yes it was very

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,489
well developed simulator open source

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,300
modular and reliable in order to do that

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,280
we should designer plugging that can

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,340
simulate a multi-agent environment and

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,620
also the same robot model that using

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,320
Robocop should also be similar simulated

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,180
engage able and also the same effector

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,210
and perceptron message should be

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,890
developed if we do that after that the

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,399
team that participate in Robocop can

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,160
easily transfer to using guessable so

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,159
this is our overall architecture of our

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,530
simulator we have a server module that

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,650
can handle the communication between

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,590
several agents and replugging and when

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,290
the agents spawned on the plugin we have

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,810
a vector part and perceptive part the

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,909
perceptor park update the perceptor

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,979
message and the effector part

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,700
interpreted the message that sent by the

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:30,210
robot and after that each agents we

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,070
update the estate of each agents all of

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,930
this module uses the gazebo ford model

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:40,920
and we model the our robot by using a CF

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,140
format and in our simulation world the

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,030
simulation step size in what is one

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,909
millisecond and the simulation

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,189
frequencies 1000 views the OD as our

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,530
physics engine in the plugging the

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,240
joints commands are so controlled by a

00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:01,009
PID controllers so we use this plug-in

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,880
in robocop 2016 in a running challenge

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:05,430
several teams around the world

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,369
participating that challenge and each

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,280
agent ran for five times and the fastest

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,970
agent won the challenge they implement

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,400
the Dakota of each team should

00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,200
implemented by themselves and we have

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,470
already to team to release their code of

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,740
their walking agent the first thing was

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,960
from united states and it can walk with

00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,110
more than one meter they use robot

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,540
learning gazebo in order to perform that

00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,840
action the second was from Portugal and

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,270
the third from Germany and if you want

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,310
you're interested in that gazebo plug-in

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:42,610
you can find the soil release source

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,650
code in the big bucket link and if you

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,200
are interested in the release agent that

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,500
can run in the gazebo you can find the

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,150
agents code in this github agent this is

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,010
a group project with a big project

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,730
sponsored by open-source robotic

00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:01,200
foundation and summer google summer of

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,200
