hello everyone my name is reader Perez I

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,080
am a mechatronic engineering student in

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:15,990
national university of engineering from

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,449
Peru so we are developing a logistic

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,990
robot based on growth with my teammates

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,630
Christopher bass on aldo area and we'd

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,460
advise for the mechatronics engineer

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:35,219
even care this is the architecture of

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:39,000
logistic robot a whole holistic Road

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:45,420
words we use at inside microcontroller

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,230
for the coding the data sent from md 25

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,570
motor controller driver this driver

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:57,960
receive all the data of the encoders and

00:00:53,570 --> 00:01:06,600
we create a new note for communicate md

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:09,000
25 with nvidia and teen side for the

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,210
rest of navigation we use a navigation

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,119
style package if we won't know where is

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:22,200
the robot every time we use our roast

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:27,900
master uri for Wi-Fi communication with

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:36,900
that error station this is a video our

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:38,939
first prototype oh well sorry this is a

00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,970
video of our first prototype and this is

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,590
at earth station using roadmaster uri

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:54,540
for Wi-Fi communication for control the

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:59,479
robot and this is the list of topics

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,479
than we use that's the first prototype

00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:10,400
