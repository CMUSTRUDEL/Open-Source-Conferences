it's great to be here see everyone from

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,600
Ross this is actually my first frost con

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,910
so yeah it's good to see such a large

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,010
group of people and this talk was called

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,080
from the internet fields to the Internet

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,880
of plants but actually I think it should

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,230
be more called what you can do with Ross

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,730
plus OpenCV in less than six months so

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,080
you'll see that as this presentation

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,510
goes on and what's what's critical here

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,890
is that you can prototype robots and you

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,480
know other parts of your system really

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,960
quickly and then test them with

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,800
customers and pivot if you need to and

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,930
traditionally this might have taken many

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,719
many many years before but now you can

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,760
do it very quickly so what's deep feel

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,440
deep feels part of the Bosch startup

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,309
platform so this is a number of

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,289
companies much more nimble we are sort

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,020
of a hundred percent owned by Bosch but

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,620
work with very separate processes

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,539
network talk a lot to customers maybe

00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,789
every second week out with farmers for

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,520
us talking with them you know trying to

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,629
find out what they want and not just

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,299
what they want but what they're willing

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,619
to pay for which is quite a different

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,970
thing so you know I mean many people

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:14,010
here in a startup would have had that

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,290
conversation where you spend say an hour

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,610
talking to a customer it's really great

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,409
they're saying that's interesting that's

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,909
interesting that's interesting you ask

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,270
them how much would you pay for it oh we

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:26,070
wouldn't pay for it so you know that's

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,979
the sort of conversation that we have a

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:31,229
lot so what we're really about is

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:32,880
sustainable agriculture if you look at

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,020
what's happened in the past with

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,579
agriculture it's all been about

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,360
increasing the productivity of the

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,790
farmer larger heavier faster tractors

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,729
all about increasing you know his

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,860
productivity and I really believe that

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,170
robotics is going to help with this and

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,750
bring back productivity to the field and

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,390
sort of give each each plant the tender

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,189
loving care it needs so that it can you

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,719
know get as much yield as possible out

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,899
of it to help feed you know a growing

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,210
population so deep field has two main

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,540
parts one is an IOT connected part this

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,069
is part of Bosch's IOT cloud solution so

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,200
these are sensor networks really

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,490
important helping detects a frost damage

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,400
on fields before it happens

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,380
you know can really save quite a lot of

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,350
produce the other part which is the main

00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:24,840
part of this talk is about robotics and

00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:29,980
the robot platforms that we've developed

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,050
so before going on to deep field Bosch

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,120
has a number of divisions some of these

00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,830
are startups some of these are part of

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,560
corporate research others are part of

00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,960
the engineering so I mean deep field

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,490
there's also Mayfield the personal

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,160
service robotics expect to hear more

00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,260
about them next year we've got our

00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,370
warehouse and logistics type robot

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:54,790
systems so these are xena way for

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:58,450
localizing within factories and Autobot

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,300
for moving you know parts around within

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:03,700
warehouses and then indoor is sort of

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,770
more in the commercial side intelligent

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,260
transport assistance there's also

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,390
research projects many of these that

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,700
probably heaps more than a listed here

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,610
collaborative robotics technologies as

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,130
well as slam and then of course many

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,520
many autonomous car groups I mean a lot

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,410
of Bosch's businesses autonomous cars so

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,390
you know we're in that space as well as

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,750
sensor networks what's common about all

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,670
these they all use Ross hopefully this

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,930
is the most number of Ross logos on a

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:37,840
slide I win that award for that but yeah

00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:41,620
Ross is certainly throughout a lot of

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,050
Bosch and has a history in Bosch so deep

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,460
field on the robotics side three main

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:53,200
platforms so on the left is the weed

00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:56,050
mobile so this is a robot for managing

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,450
weeds it uses our patents stamping tool

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,870
to basically smash weeds into the ground

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,270
this is ongoing development to do this

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,670
in the middle is the bonny Rob I'll talk

00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,010
more about that in the next slide and on

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,950
the right is our Fino 'mobile and that's

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,810
the main topic of this talk so the bonny

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,170
Rob is the robot that most people would

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:19,270
know and recognize some sometimes you

00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:21,100
see it in green an earlier version of it

00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:24,550
it's basically a multi-purpose

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,000
autonomous tractor so you can build

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,370
various implements for

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,210
this has sensors on it to detect

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,760
obstacles

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:34,390
it has 12 motors so it can change its

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,970
width so it can navigate down track rows

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:41,120
it's been Ross since version 2 which has

00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:43,790
really helped we've sold two of these to

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,410
research partners and having the Ross

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,750
system has nailed us to collaborate with

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,840
them much more easily and expose the

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,520
interfaces that we want for them expect

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,370
to see some more about this there's some

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,550
ongoing work about collaboration with

00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,190
Bonnie Rob the robot here as well as

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:06,770
with UAVs for scouting and things like

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,720
that so plant breeding this is really

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,780
important it's been one of the primary

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,380
reasons that we've been able to increase

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:18,310
the yield of crop so new varieties are

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,560
tested in the lab and then over about

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:24,169
ten years from when they're developed in

00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,570
the lab they're put out in the fields

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:29,090
and constantly tested and working out

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,560
you know which ones actually work and so

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,080
this is important to test for say

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,340
disease resistance as well as you know

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,470
the actual yield they're going to get

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,160
and you know making sure they work in

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,780
each particular region and there's many

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,950
tens of thousands of these plots

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,810
spreaded over

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,760
you know large geographical areas and

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,290
each plot has hundreds of plants in it

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,060
and what you can see in the photo is

00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,820
really state of the art in terms of

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,940
monitoring these fields so people go out

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:58,660
and they count the plants or they'll

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,340
pick a few of them out and cut them up

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,650
or you know they'll look for diseases

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,360
and you know they're basically selecting

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,520
you know which trials go on which

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,140
varieties go on and which don't and as

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,200
you can imagine this is quite tedious

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,930
work lots of people need to do this and

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,490
it's ambiguous so you have multiple

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,110
people doing it over multiple regions

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,690
multiple cultural sort of

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,720
interpretations and yeah I mean it's not

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,300
not necessarily consistent um there's

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,220
been as well after this you generate a

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,320
lot of paperwork and state of the art

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,180
for this is putting it into an Excel

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,940
spreadsheet and then you know merging it

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,020
later and you know that's sort of

00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,730
is probably not the best practice so

00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,590
there's a variety of solutions for this

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:46,600
from satellite imagery through to

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:49,250
fixed-wing aircraft multi rotor aircraft

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,050
platforms on the field as well as in the

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,050
lab you know moving the plants around on

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,470
conveyor belts so deep field solution is

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,180
a semi autonomous platform we're working

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,760
with our pilot customers trooper on this

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,500
so this robot is diesel-powered it's

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,960
about 2 meters wide

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,520
when I say semi autonomous I mean a

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,040
person still drives it onto the field

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,230
but for each plot it drives by itself

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,040
it's actually more accurate than the

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:18,050
person when it's driving by itself so we

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,360
have some cameras and I'll talk a bit

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,070
more about them in a sec measuring the

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,930
plants and so what we're interested in

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,460
measuring though is counting the total

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,700
number of plants that have emerged as

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,400
well as ones that have died measuring

00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,590
the size of the plant so the height the

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,650
color of them as well as the canopy and

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,840
by canopy sort of mean leaf area so in

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,790
the 2d sensor when the plants quite

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,620
small you can measure the the plant air

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,600
age with a 2d measurement but as it gets

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,980
large you need to measure it in 3d so

00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,830
you can get an accurate measure of the

00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:51,470
of the plant having a little bit more

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,560
into the robot and seeing what it's seen

00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,419
so we have two cameras a 2d camera so

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,140
one of these is a jake amaura this is

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,700
RGB IR camera for measuring the plants

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:05,570
and we do this at the early stage and

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:09,320
then in a later stage we use a 3d camera

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:14,060
the Kinect to to get the 3d structure of

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:16,610
the plants so for this particular study

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,790
that you saw there over 40 days we

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,530
recorded plants 17 times so in the early

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,730
stages with the 2d measurement in the

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,690
later stage with the 3d measurement

00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:30,919
getting a little bit deeper into the

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:32,630
technical details of the platform the I

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,589
mean most of this robot is best practice

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,789
for robot design we have safety PLC

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:42,650
heartbeats between different parts of

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:44,780
the system diagnostic nodes so our

00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,450
lowest level of our drive control is the

00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,390
drive ECU I'll talk more about

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,310
on the next slide we also have our

00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:53,980
control and coordination where our us

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,560
master runs this talks to various relays

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,660
as well as our control and diagnostics

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,970
tablet for monitoring you know it's

00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,070
performance and then this also talks to

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,710
our camera app so we have three of these

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,230
recording at one time one important

00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,560
thing is that the end of each trial we

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:14,140
run a sanity check on the data to make

00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,210
sure that it's okay so that the correct

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,950
velocities were maintained as well as

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,660
say with the camera that you didn't

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,720
forget to like take the lens cap off as

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,040
many of us I'm sure I've done so we have

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,380
this robot it's in the middle of the

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,510
field we've got hundreds of gigabytes of

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,450
data recorded onto it and we need to get

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,520
that back to Deep Field so we don't take

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,550
three and a quarter inch floppies it is

00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,760
actually SSDs that we take from the

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,760
robot back to our bag bunker which we'll

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,240
talk about a little bit more in a second

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,370
so we take these two what we call upload

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,930
Bay which is connected to bag bunker

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,900
these enable us to load it into the

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,520
system when bag bunker has run a sanity

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,650
check on it and we know that this data

00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,300
has been properly uploaded a file is

00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,280
written to the SSD so that when it's

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:04,110
taken back to the robot the robot knows

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,000
that it's finally okay to delete the

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:10,210
files from the bag files from its own

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,610
computers and over the course of two

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,520
months we recorded at about 24 terabytes

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,470
of data and we didn't lose any data in

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,190
this process so it was quite a reliable

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,560
system so now we've got all this data in

00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:28,360
our system then we run our pipeline on

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,520
the bag files to you know find all the

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,630
plants and get these ready for display

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:36,160
on our website so to process through the

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,320
24 terabytes I think it's about two

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,040
million plants and takes us about three

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,930
days to run through all this so the

00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,580
drive ECU you know one of the

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,130
requirements for this was it had to be

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,960
absolutely real-time and you know this

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:52,300
monitoring of interrupts lots of

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:56,080
discussion in deep field you know many

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,209
people more towards let's go the really

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,369
embedded controller proper artists

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:03,110
type system all the way through to let's

00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,059
just get it working three lots of

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,309
hardware at it make sure you know hope

00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:09,019
that it doesn't have any problems on the

00:11:07,309 --> 00:11:11,149
solution deep field was to use a no

00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,490
droid with the preamp patch

00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,949
now obviously you trade throughput but

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,360
then that's not such a big problem when

00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,269
you're just running more motor control

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,160
loops for it the question is how

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:26,660
reliable is it and you know is it really

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,490
real time the OS ADL runs racks with

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,939
these machines and one of them is owed

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,429
roids so over a year they've been

00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:36,139
running performance tests on it looking

00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,819
I mean obviously you want to check that

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:39,470
things don't crash and all of that but

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:41,689
one of the key things you're you're

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,389
after is unsatisfying worst case latency

00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:47,749
and so in this diagram you can see that

00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:53,179
with many many tests you know it's

00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:54,470
maintained no no outliers in latency so

00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,259
that gives us some confidence that this

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,999
is a is a good platform and kernel to

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:04,220
use so lifecycle management really

00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,049
important it's coming in Raza 2.0 which

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,879
is great to see we needed it a little

00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:10,220
bit earlier so we ported it back into

00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,839
two Ross one sure many of us have had

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,119
the problem we've got launch files with

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,149
number of nodes and we need to get them

00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:19,429
all started up and sync properly and

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,990
been ordered and I'm sure many if it's

00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:23,360
done the hack where we wait for

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,179
something to publish before we start the

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,160
next node started up life cycle helps

00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,350
with this but that's not the only reason

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,509
for it it's really to help give explicit

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,339
visibility of the operational state of

00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:36,049
each of the nodes so you can really tell

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,869
what state they're in and bring them up

00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:40,939
and down you know you know defined and

00:12:38,869 --> 00:12:43,309
explicit manner we use this as the

00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:45,649
moment for controlling our cameras in

00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:48,049
our lighting system so that we know what

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:50,959
state that they're in and there's going

00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:55,790
to be released open source of this are

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:58,160
soon we also have control and

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,350
diagnostics display so I mean there is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,319
already systems in Ross for monitoring

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,540
you know Ross out or RV's we needed a

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,669
custom solution for this so you can see

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,269
the green triangle which is our robot

00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:10,269
driving along

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,020
rectangle is the plot and you can see

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,910
the robot driving along as it gets to

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,460
the end once it's run the sanity check

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,980
it now knows that that trial has been

00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,740
successfully recorded and we can go on

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,210
to the next next one so in the bottom

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,300
left you can see the camera images you

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,880
can click on these and get bigger

00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,100
pictures of them both in RGB and the ir

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,100
imagery so that you can check what the

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,020
robot is seen at the top you can see a

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,690
little green bar so this is basically

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:44,150
the proportional error so early on

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,070
people were actually driving the robots

00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,810
this would help give them the control

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,180
input that they needed on the joystick

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,920
of where to drive the robot but

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,380
eventually this was connected through to

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,260
the robot so that it could do it

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,940
autonomously in the bottom left corner

00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,740
as well when the robot starts to move

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,620
along here you'll see some of the

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,120
monitoring the Diagnostics and this is a

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,820
little bit you know picture showing the

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,130
state of the robot so for example if the

00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,740
cpu speed gets too high it'll alert the

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:19,490
user so that we know in real time that

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:22,760
these problems are happening so back

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,890
bunker on many projects I've always

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,900
wished to be able to look up that bag

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,660
file that I recorded two years ago I

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,030
knew it was some date roughly the

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,850
location I mean that's what bag bunker

00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:38,210
helps you to do you can search for bag

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:41,810
files within your storage system and not

00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:44,060
only that it also can run scripts on it

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,700
so to do as I said for sanity checking

00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:50,360
to make sure that they're okay as well

00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,560
as produce a imagery or plots I want to

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,110
talk about more about that because this

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,330
is the focus of the next talk and dealin

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,339
we'll be talking about that and

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,650
explaining this and we've released this

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:03,860
open source and yet diem will talk about

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:07,640
that more so now we have a load data in

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:11,810
bag bunker we want to actually process

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,000
it so we've recorded over 17 days and we

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,120
need to register the plants over those

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,490
days so that we get the same plant in

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,380
the same location so the first part is

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,819
this is classification so we use a

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,379
random forest tree to classify

00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:26,899
this gives us a pretty good accuracy

00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:29,899
about 90 percent on a per frame basis

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:32,149
but once we've registered the images so

00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,379
we used GPS locations for each plan and

00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,329
once we've registered these over

00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,179
multiple days we get you know really

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:40,249
really high accuracy it's much easier to

00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:41,899
check the plants later on one of the

00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:44,569
specifications for this is that we would

00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,910
detect emergence of plants down to 0.1

00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,799
centimeter squared so at that size it's

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:53,449
a little bit hard to classify but later

00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:55,429
on it becomes much easier so on the side

00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:57,769
you can see the original classification

00:15:55,429 --> 00:16:00,199
or the previous classification green

00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,759
meaning a sugar B and red meaning a weed

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,649
and as it goes through some of these

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,449
will change color because of later

00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:07,369
information as you know it's given us

00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:15,619
more information to give a better class

00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:17,569
to the plant so we also have our so once

00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:19,999
we have this data processed we upload it

00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:22,789
to websites so our customers can can

00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:25,609
view it they don't all use Ross

00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:28,399
so this is our Deep Field cloud site you

00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:32,779
can select the particular series of pot

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:35,779
that you want to have a look at and so

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,329
in here you can see an image on the side

00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:41,029
showing the the plot location so a

00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:42,549
number of varieties of plant of sugar

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:44,959
beet in this case were tested and

00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:49,100
against potentially different herbicides

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,619
or whatnot so from here you can have a

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,479
look at the average leaf area over time

00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:55,100
as it grew as well as the emergence of

00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:57,649
the plants over time as they were

00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,419
detected if you need more detail than

00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,720
that you can go and click on a

00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:06,289
particular variety and combination of

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,970
applicator on it and then get more

00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:10,159
details so you can see the emergence

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,529
rates as well as mortality how many

00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:15,889
plants died and the leaf area for that

00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:18,259
as well as see histogram of that leaf

00:17:15,889 --> 00:17:20,629
area again if you need more detail about

00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,949
one particular plot you can go in and

00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:26,000
have a look at the stitched imagery for

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:29,389
that and then see the individual plants

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,169
so Green is a sugar beet and the orange

00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:34,429
is a weed that's detected for each of

00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,500
those you can go in and click on each

00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:38,480
one and have a better look at the

00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,980
as well as some statistics on it if you

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,200
need more detail you can go into the

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,330
detailed view and in here you can see

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,420
each image that has been registered

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:48,950
across time for that particular plant so

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,950
you can scroll through each of these

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:54,590
individual plants and then if you want

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,840
to see the 3d imagery you can go and

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:03,050
zoom in and have a detailed look at the

00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:06,410
particular plant that you want okay so

00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:09,230
future for us focusing on the technical

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,350
side love bras 22.0 what's coming up

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:13,640
this is going to be really good you know

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:17,510
there's platforms have been developed

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,610
where we do it in Ross and then you have

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,050
to rewrite everything eventually so

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,820
hopefully roster guano can help us with

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,540
this in getting commercial products out

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,390
much faster offline processing so the

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,360
second part is processing our bag files

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,130
offline and Ross is great in terms of

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,810
the online processing in the message but

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,080
we really do need deterministic

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:41,000
processing of this for it and in

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,060
particular handling the node startup

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,860
clock type problem obviously you could

00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,830
just rewrite the whole thing to just be

00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,600
no Ross at the end but we want to keep

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,580
so then we can move it online or offline

00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,910
as need be so we need some solutions for

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,320
this that we'll work on has been spoken

00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,360
about this morning you can never have

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,820
enough testing if you're planning to

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,880
develop a robot system at least allow

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:08,270
half the time for testing and building

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,820
tools at least half the time and despite

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,130
having some unit tests you know the

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,400
docker build system and all these other

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,570
code code review and everything else

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,800
still need more testing and I think

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,320
we'll have to end up with scraping

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,470
websites and trying to check these

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:27,380
against our original bag bag files so

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,840
we'll need to work on that an accurate

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,940
timing of sensors for me I separate

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,980
cameras that are designed for computer

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,870
vision versus sensors that are designed

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,030
for robots whether they have a trigger

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,920
line and you can synchronize other parts

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,960
of your robot to it all too often we

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,240
just put Ross time now when we receive

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,670
the message unfortunately that's not

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,410
exactly the time that the actual data

00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,510
was collected by the sensor so I'd love

00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,740
to see this

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,030
a bit more embedded into to Ross so

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:58,300
hopefully this has shown a little bit

00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:00,190
about what Ross plus open C V can enable

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,670
you to do very quickly build an

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,750
autonomous platform as well as pipeline

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,660
which really helps if you want to test

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,210
something rapidly with customers so the

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,910
Deep Field team you can see some of our

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,790
alumni have worked with us in the past

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,980
tenaris if you want a great website

00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,200
great web tech talk to them they've been

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,550
really really good as well as support

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,550
from our Bosch corporate team

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:38,250
and Dion's here as well who might be

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:53,300
able to help answer some questions as

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:54,960
well yeah that's really hard

00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,960
particularly in agriculture

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,310
there's particularly in agriculture

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,950
that's really hard there's lots of

00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:04,140
different customers with different needs

00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,190
and you know even the same crop is not

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,090
growing the same way in different

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,200
locations so it is hard to do that we

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:11,880
just spend a lot of time talking to

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,320
customers one other thing you can't do

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,000
though is just turn up to a farmer and

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,220
just talk about an idea and expect them

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,560
to be able to evaluate the worth of it

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,730
that's one reason I mean you might say

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,440
we should have just not built this at

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,960
all and just totally focused on talking

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,100
to customers but you really need

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,750
something to show them what you're

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,250
talking about and a lot of the time you

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,930
don't get your foot in the door to talk

00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,670
to them until you've shown that you're

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:37,970
willing to do something yourself and

00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,970
build it so yeah still working on that

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,370
okay

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:15,890
so scribed it as semi-autonomous or the

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,320
drive so a person still drives the robot

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:20,330
onto the field and then just along the

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,010
plot which is a straight line the robot

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:26,140
is autonomous in that so it's actually a

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:29,720
fairly simple controller for that

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:34,309
alright so so I heard about some argue

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:36,020
coaching robots before so do you

00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:37,490
consider providing a service where you

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,230
come to the field with a robot or

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,120
renting a robot instead of selling

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,419
machines which is difficult for some

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,090
people to accept and buy for full price

00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:48,980
yeah absolutely farmers are used to both

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,840
models so sometimes they'll buy very

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,240
expensive machinery and sometimes they

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,340
will just take the service and so

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,669
they're used to both types of business

00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:03,669
cases and certainly exploring both is

00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:03,669
