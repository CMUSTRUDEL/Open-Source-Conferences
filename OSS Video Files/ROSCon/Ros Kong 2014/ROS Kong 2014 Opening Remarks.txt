as he said welcome thanks for coming

00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:06,600
after Ross Kong we're really hoping that

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,610
this is an opportunity that you all can

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,260
meet each other I believe coming into

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,450
this event the thing that I really want

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,670
to do is help build the community this

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,100
is our first event in the Eurasian area

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,480
and we really want to emphasize who's

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,369
here what the cool things are doing and

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,890
get you to get communicating more with

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,859
other people here so start off I want to

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,010
thank our sponsors they make this happen

00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:37,170
Yujin robot guy tech and ETR I have all

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,879
sponsored this event they're making it

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,320
possible that we can keep our the fees

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,559
low and try to get as many people here

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,180
as possible and in addition this is

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,190
being put on by the open-source robotics

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,469
foundation and great thanks to all the

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:55,350
people here at Hong Kong University who

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,940
have helped make this happen so I just

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,980
want to give a quick shout out to

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,449
everybody that helped me organize it on

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,660
the organizing committee with committee

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,600
we with me was Brian gerke why Newman

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,979
and Daniel Stonier we've been working

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,420
for the last several months to put this

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,590
all together unfortunately Brian

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,990
couldn't make it he had a conflicting

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,400
meeting in Houston right now so he can't

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,350
be here but he did put a lot of work

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,450
into this and i also want to give a

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,880
special thanks to any lamb who was our

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,290
local administrator who made everything

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,490
happen all the food everything so thank

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,549
great thanks to her if you see her out

front give her a thank you so this quick

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,320
overview of the agenda we've got five

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,180
talks today to coffee breaks a lunch

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,040
over lunch we're going to be doing demos

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,829
of Atlas which will be just in the next

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
room over that's why I said will be

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,049
cycling through so you can go and take a

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,250
look and see the demo um the other

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,960
important things are we're going to have

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,640
birds of a feather meeting time and

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,520
lightning talks I'll cover those a

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,500
little bit more coming up this agenda is

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,590
on a vent straÃŸe torg on the Ross Kong

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,619
website you can see it there if you want

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,689
to get more details also at the top of

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,610
that page there's now a Google+ event

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,899
link if you click on that I've started

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,430
sharing some photos there and if you

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,410
want you can also upload photos of the

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,880
event there as well

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,900
as why I mentioned we have there's free

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Wi-Fi the SSID is HQ open Wi-Fi click

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,320
accept in the browser to get through so

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,780
just give a little bit of background

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,250
mostly you probably know us by now I'm

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,980
from the open-source robotics foundation

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,890
we're a small nonprofit in Mountain View

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,420
set up with the mission to support the

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,400
development distribution and adoption of

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,470
open-source software for use in robotics

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,290
research education and product

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,880
development you can see a nice shot of

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,230
our building and this is where we are in

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:55,560
the map in California and we were here

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,170
to promote you guys really our mission

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,730
as a nonprofit is to go and grow the

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,590
community that's why we put on these

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,050
events to get everybody here together

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,650
and let you take advantage of the open

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,580
source software and robotics so please

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:14,150
do take advantage of it quick summary

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,540
this is these are the people at OS RF

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:20,640
right now we're slowly growing but you

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,130
may see a bunch of familiar faces on

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,320
here you've been on our mailing lists or

00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:29,640
github so give you a little bit of

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,420
overview what's going on in Ross right

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,440
now we're in the beta release cycle for

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,830
indigo igloo which is our next release

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,300
see our logo really want to give a great

00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,370
thanks to all the maintainer that have

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,640
made releases we've passed five hundred

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,190
packages and we're still in beta last

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,230
the last release was Hydra Medusa and we

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,630
had about 500 packages at release time

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,150
and we've slowly grown over time we're

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,250
now over 1,200 packages in Hydra Medusa

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,720
that are released so we're looking

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,030
forward to more continued growth of

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,709
indigo igloo and the release should be

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,760
coming up in the next couple weeks after

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,690
we've been through this testing cycle

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,850
another thing that we talked about a

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,040
little bit last year at ross con is the

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,940
next generation of ross one of the

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,090
things we're doing at the open-source

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,950
erotics foundation is we're working on

00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,060
going in reviewing all the lessons we've

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,620
learned during the development of ross

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,710
so we want to come back and do a next

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,360
generation of it that will provide more

00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,490
reliable product that we can

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,159
convince people that they can use in

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,379
commercial products right now Ross is

00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:33,580
heavily used in research and often when

00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,280
you want to transition a commercial

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,780
product Ross is pulled out and re

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,030
implemented in their custom

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,080
implementation and to that end we've

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,479
been exploring lots of different

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,909
middlewares I'll let you know that we've

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,740
currently we've settled our prototyping

00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:52,680
the go up build on top of dds which is

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:56,889
data distribution services I think and

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,389
the this is a standard that's been

00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,279
developed there's several different

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,889
vendors that sell implementations as

00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:03,969
well as open source implementations some

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,590
of these implement commercial

00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:07,840
implementations our flight verified by

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,779
NASA first flight on the space shuttle

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,389
and the National Space Station and

00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:17,650
because of because of that we think that

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:19,240
we can it will now give people the idea

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,580
that this is actually a standardized

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,770
product that has a really rock solid

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,529
core it's good enough for NASA to fly to

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,110
the into space with and we'll build Ross

00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:30,610
on top of that we are going to work hard

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,740
to make sure we keep all the ease of use

00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,969
that you've come familiar with Ross one

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,469
of the most valuable things about Ross

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:37,360
is how quickly you can prototype and

00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,310
develop and we're going to make sure to

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,729
keep that quick prototype development

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:45,069
cycle and simple API but we will expose

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,870
the power of dds under the hood for

00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:49,210
example it has over 20 different types

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:52,509
of quality of services but for most of

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,099
you one default will be fine but we'll

00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,289
let you get hooks to dig in under the

00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:59,650
hood and manipulate all of the 20 some

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,539
quality of service metrics so it's

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,279
exciting we'll be communicating more

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:04,719
about this to the community hopefully

00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:09,599
starting with some white papers and then

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:11,409
continuing on to open prototyping and

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:17,409
getting more feedback from the community

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:18,669
as we iterate so as I mentioned we're

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:20,409
going to have birds of a feather session

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,599
at the end of the day this will be the

00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:24,639
last I think close to two hours and the

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,089
goal of this session is that you can

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,259
come up here and propose a topic and

00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:30,819
people will come along and plus one the

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,529
topic and the topics of the most plus

00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,509
ones will separate off into small groups

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:37,029
and you can go join the group that has a

00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:39,030
similar interest to you some of these

00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,310
topics may be

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,170
something like move it or pcl or open

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,680
CVE or integration with some particular

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,140
robot and how do you leverage those and

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,070
you just want to get more people that

00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,960
are interested in talking about the same

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,980
topic this is a great opportunity you've

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,380
got people from all around the world

00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,950
coming here and it's much easier to talk

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,240
in person than on a mailing list so I'm

00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,130
going to during the breaks we'll pull

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,930
the screen up there's a whiteboard here

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,780
please come up and write a topic down

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,210
and either suggest first half or second

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,740
half and then if you see a topic that

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,620
you like come and put a plus one on it

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,500
so that we know which topics are popular

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:23,770
and we can prioritize which groups will

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:25,660
form so in addition to birds of a

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,790
feather another complementary thing

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,530
we're going to do is lightning talks so

00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,470
lightning talks you have three minutes

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:34,840
and up to three slides and you can come

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,000
up here and tell people about what

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,560
you're doing or what you want to talk

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,480
about or anything it's a great way to

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,700
promote a birds of a feather session

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,790
saying I want to come up here hi my name

00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,640
is Tully I want to talk about the build

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,250
system and I'm currently working on it

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:55,450
doing X Y Z the next steps are going to

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,880
be foo and bar and I want to do a birds

00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,340
of feather please sign up for it that's

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,320
a great sort of talk lightning talk you

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,790
only have three minutes and if you want

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,450
to do this Dave Coleman can you stand up

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:09,910
Dave Coleman at the back he's collecting

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,800
the slides you bring them a USB stick

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,600
with your throw up to three slides

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,690
preferably PDF format so we can stitch

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,000
them all together easily and he will MC

slides if you don't want to make slides

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,020
you can just give them a title and help

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,030
