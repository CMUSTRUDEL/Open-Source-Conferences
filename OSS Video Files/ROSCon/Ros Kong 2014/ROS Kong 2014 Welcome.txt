	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
but first I'd like to introduce our dean

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:10,099
of engineering professor Norman TN to

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,099
welcome you here to this event Ezra can

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:20,730
write good morning everybody and let's

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,869
see for those of you who have just

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:28,050
arrived in hong kong for this workshop

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:31,289
welcome to Hong Kong and it's it's a

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,110
great dynamic fun place so I hope you

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,380
enjoy your stay beyond hopefully this

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,640
workshop for those of you who have been

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,160
here before or we're at I cried just now

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,230
you've been to Hong Kong so i will in to

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,649
welcome you and the rest of everybody

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,340
else to the University of Hong Kong as

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:57,059
wide mentioned we are helping host this

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:02,489
particular event and I'm actually very

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:06,479
very glad to be able to do that in Hong

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,810
Kong we are losing the screen you wanna

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,170
yes because it'll take a minute to bring

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,009
back up in Hong Kong one of the things

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,400
that I hope that we can achieve is to

00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:22,320
diversify the economic base here I mean

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,930
if you want to draw an analogy to

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,170
another world leading city a Hong Kong

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,140
is very similar to Manhattan of new york

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,960
city in the US and it's also very

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,479
similar to london in that these are the

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,659
three probably major financial centers

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,799
in the world but what you have in hong

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,450
kong is in my opinion an overemphasis or

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,030
over-reliance on the economic and

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,509
financial sector so I would like to see

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,610
a more of a technology sector be built

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,140
up here now if you're talking about

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,170
trying to build the technology sector

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,049
here ideally you try to find something

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,770
that's picking up Steve s-sorry picking

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,229
up speed in terms of a new wave that's

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,289
you know going across the globe and for

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:13,200
all of you here it is obviously in

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,680
robotics and so we are very much trying

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,019
to do

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,959
robotics not just here at the University

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:21,900
of Hong Kong but for Hong Kong and so

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,450
having Ross con here I think is going to

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,760
be a wonderful thing for us and for the

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,230
region during the day I know you'll be

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,439
able to get a chance to take a look at

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,719
Atlas and part of our advanced robotics

00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,269
initiative in order to make this big

00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,969
push we did bring Atlas here and are

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:41,909
participating in the DARPA Robotics

00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:46,319
Challenge and so we're we're jumping

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:48,510
into this you know feet first head first

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,950
I guess the whole body into the into the

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,709
into the pool so enjoy your stay here

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,189
and enjoy the workshop all right thank

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,189
