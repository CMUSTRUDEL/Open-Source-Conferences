	00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,980
introduction thank you guys for coming

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,899
to see this talk I'm going to talk about

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,980
Ross industrial and I'm going to present

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,460
it as an open source case study so first

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,890
off what do I hope to present to you

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,490
today to communicate to you today well

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,260
what I really want to do is use rossa

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,340
industrial as an example to motivate

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,189
others to start an open source project

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,289
or effort that builds upon Ross but is

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,450
separate right there's a group of people

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,050
who are supporting it and doing the

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,270
development and even though it's a part

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,850
of Ross there's a core group behind it

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,370
and then for those of you who maybe

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,200
aren't management type people and you

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,809
don't want to manage something and you

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,230
want to you want to develop code I I

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,710
want to motivate you guys to participate

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,739
in these programs and be an active

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,239
participant so I'm talking about more

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,580
than just being a casual user or you

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,750
know responding to an email on the

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:14,520
user's group i'm talking about

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:15,689
developing so what and what am I going

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,400
to talk about the first thing I'm going

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,820
to talk about is the emergence of these

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,400
these programs write these small but the

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,820
small but organized groups that are

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,729
developing components and capabilities

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,250
within Ross and they're coming out of

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,409
the community but their disparate groups

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,350
in that they come they have members from

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,900
different organizations and so it isn't

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,100
just one company or one research lab

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,689
it's a lot of people coming together and

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,939
really that that's what Ross industrial

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,590
is and it aims to be more of that in the

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,869
future so I'm going to present it as a

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,590
case study of how we started Ross

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,939
industrial and why that made sense and

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,070
then I'll talk about the importance of

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,490
these programs and why I think they need

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,290
to to be organized and even though it

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,399
feels like we're kind of divining up the

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:12,330
Ross world why that's important and then

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,530
I'll end with some conclusions

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,080
so it shouldn't be no surprise that

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,910
these communities these small small

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,810
groups have have developed out of the

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,910
rawson or the Ross community I get I've

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,010
gotten in arguments before with people

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,530
about you know what Ross capability is

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,470
is very good and what things need to be

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,330
improved but the reality is none of that

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,910
matters all that much because we're

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,670
Ross's core strength is is in its

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:44,100
community it's the fact that we can have

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,600
a meeting over the weekend and attracts

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,430
you know 250 plus people so when I talk

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,260
about programs i really mean things that

00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:56,640
are larger than just the single package

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,110
that somebody puts out on github and i

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,090
mean that there's something that there's

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,310
an organization behind them there's a

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,380
group of people they meet they they

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,750
create tasks so it's really a software

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,120
development team and there's maintenance

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,790
behind it so when they put out a product

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,440
when i put out there their package they

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,330
stand behind it they do bug fixes well

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,050
it turns out we already have a lot of

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,660
these we have the cigs and some of those

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,269
are pretty well organized the drivers

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,880
sake is a good example of one that's

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,370
well organized and probably has a core

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,480
group associated with it we saw a

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,060
presentation on web tools and again that

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,540
was you can see that there are multiple

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:45,300
institutions standing behind it and

00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,040
that's very important when my management

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,269
comes to me and says hey should we use

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,470
web tools for our next project if if I

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:54,750
go and look and it only had one

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,150
developer ever developing it I may not

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,310
really consider it an option because I

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,590
might end up supporting web tools by

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,300
myself but now I know that there's a

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,950
group of people behind it and there's

00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,220
probably low risk and us using it in a

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:13,049
project and there's there's many others

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,510
as well and Ross industrial just happens

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,479
to be one of those Ross industrials a

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,940
little bit unique because we're not so

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,550
much focused on the technology like web

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,680
tools maybe we're focused on the market

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:30,330
of industrial robotics and automation

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,860
applications so I'm going to give you

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:35,460
some background and talk a little bit

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:41,370
about Ross industrial and how we got

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:43,530
where we are so as I said our focus is

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,220
industrial automation and robotics

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,750
applications so it's not necessarily

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,389
technology focus but it's that market

00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:53,220
that we're going after the primary

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:57,690
objectives of the Ross industrial

00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,690
program our first developing technology

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,340
so when we first got started we focused

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,509
on developing drivers for all the

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,590
various different robot platforms and

00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:09,919
standardizing interfaces so that we

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:14,039
could swap in and out robots very easily

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,560
we've gotten well along on that so now

00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,840
we're talking more about what

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,419
capabilities are specific to industrial

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,419
applications and if you saw the demo at

00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:27,780
the Yaskawa Motoman booth you'd see some

00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,930
capability a deburring application that

00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,340
is very industrial and it's not

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,220
something that we would expect would

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,780
come out of the Ross community at large

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,460
but it's within raw it's within Ross

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,490
industrial we also hope to create a

00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,770
community just like Ross but smaller and

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,330
this is very important in the industrial

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,370
world because these things don't tend to

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,130
self-organize like they do in the

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,960
software world and so there are lots of

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,370
people doing industrial research and

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,110
they don't really know about each other

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:04,340
and we hope Ross industrial will bring

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:06,870
them together we also want to engage

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,090
industry and this is something that

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,539
these technology focus groups don't

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,669
necessarily focus on is how do we go out

00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,229
to industry and get them involved get

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:18,930
their opinion on what we should be doing

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,599
and you know maybe get them to help fund

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,310
us give us some money so we can we can

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,060
continue development and do things like

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,220
maintenance now I don't want to I know a

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,710
lot of people are interested in what

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,389
Ross industrial can do and and I've

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,550
given this talk several times and

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,849
there's more information on on our

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,949
YouTube channel if you look at a rasta I

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:43,559
Consortium you'll find a lot more

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:45,659
information but I want to take what

00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:47,909
little time I had here to talk a lot

00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:49,860
about Ross industrial because my main

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:52,289
goal is to motivate you to start

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,020
something similar so I want to talk

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:59,189
about instead how we did what we did

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:02,339
when we created Ross industrial but here

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,169
is our one year video so we're at about

00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,199
a year and a half now but here are some

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:08,819
of the applications we were able to do

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,409
this is the very first thing we did when

00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,209
when I was at Willow Garage we

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:14,249
demonstrate on modem and pick in place

00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:17,519
and then we moved on to different

00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:19,349
different robots in the industrial world

00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,159
just about every industrial robots a

00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:29,009
different color so you can see we we

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:30,389
support all colors of robots so a lot of

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,830
you may look at this and be like last

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:34,259
night impressive Ross's have been able

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,119
to do that for a while but remember

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,559
we're selling it to industry and they

00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:39,899
haven't seen that they're not plugged

00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:41,429
into the Ross community and they haven't

00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,409
seen it happen on their own equipment

00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:46,319
and those two things together really

00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:52,949
speaks to them and you know it gets them

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:54,990
interested in what we're doing so this

00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,930
video also shows a lot of stuff that did

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,449
not happen at Southwest Research where I

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,819
work and I said we were trying to build

00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:05,550
a community and that's true of some of

00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,499
these these projects that were showing

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,740
in this video happened around the world

00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:17,209
and we did blatantly steal the one-year

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,209
video idea from Ross so thanks for that

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,150
so I'm going to let it play through and

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:34,390
at the end you can see some of the they

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:38,529
all the groups that are that send in

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,300
videos for this so like I said we write

00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:42,219
about a year and a half into it now and

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,500
we really want to grow this community we

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:47,440
have a good relationships both in the

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,089
United States and here in Europe but we

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,010
would really like to see more people be

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:58,360
involved all right so if I'm trying to

00:08:54,010 --> 00:09:01,810
convince you to start a program related

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,220
to Ross or that builds upon Ross I have

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,960
to tell you how it's going to benefit

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,040
you because you're probably going to

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,930
you're probably going to want to know

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,190
how it's going to help me if I go

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,010
through all this effort because it

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,440
really is a lot of effort so I can tell

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:17,230
you how Southwest Research has benefited

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,290
from the Ross industrial program the

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,760
first is increased name recognition

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,339
there are probably people in this

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,980
audience you know who i am and know who

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:30,279
southwest research institute is only

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,020
because of ross industrial but we're

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,990
actually a very large company we're in

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,839
the United States and we should be a lot

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,370
more well-known than we are but Ross

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,339
industrials certainly helping in that

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,220
regard we've gotten dozens of new

00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,900
contacts all around the world these

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:53,050
these are everything from potential

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:54,839
clients to collaborators so that has

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:58,150
definitely been very valuable for us

00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:01,000
several rd project awards so southwest

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,160
research institute whom I work for the

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,430
way we make our money is governments and

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,490
commercial companies pay us to do rd for

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,290
them so I can point to that and show my

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,630
management look there's a there's a

00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:17,860
dollar return investment for for what

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:19,570
we've done with Ross industrial we've

00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,029
also created the Ross industrial

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,890
consortium in North America and that's a

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,800
broad in industry so that was one of our

00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,260
goals that's that's a method of getting

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,390
industry involved but it's also a method

00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,610
of getting them to kind of pony up in

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,170
fund development its development that

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,620
they're interested in and they want to

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,240
drive but we do need funding to keep

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,070
these things going

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,580
there's been a European Ross industrial

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,430
effort led by fraunhofer ebah and that

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,830
is that's very valuable to us to be

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,070
associated with such an institution over

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:57,410
here in Europe and finally we attract

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,510
top talent we don't have to go out and

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,970
find people to come work for us anymore

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,860
they come and find us and they

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:08,480
contribute software and we know who they

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,250
are before we ever get started so what's

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,820
the recipe for success if you want to

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,660
create a open source program well first

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,890
you have to come up with the idea and

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,800
you know these don't have to be

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,360
groundbreaking ideas saying that we're

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,240
going to use Ross for industrial

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,620
applications is quite simple actually

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,550
and other people we're thinking about it

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:34,580
we didn't know that but that's it wasn't

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,350
a very complex idea you have to build it

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,990
you have to show something because it's

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,490
really hard to show to sell something or

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,060
tell people about something that's not

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,100
there we all understand vision but not

00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,020
everybody will buy your vision most but

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,290
most people will at least listen when

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,660
you say hey I have something to show you

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,090
brand it that's what Ross industrial is

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,280
done that is what's Ross is done web

00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,620
tools has done a good job you need a

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,180
good name you need something to that

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,230
people will associate with your program

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,080
promote it early is something that I

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,730
learned from Willow Garage which is you

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,590
know you have to tell people about what

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,890
you're doing before you've really even

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:18,080
started you make it help you may get

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,780
feedback and you're going to start

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,700
generating buzz but a lot of times i

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,600
find that we we wait till we're all done

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:28,130
and then we tell people what we did and

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,960
you may end up in a place where we're

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,690
nobody I don't want to say nobody cares

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,280
but but you wouldn't you're not getting

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,610
the results that you thought you're

00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,230
going to get documentation we all know

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,640
if it isn't documented we're probably

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,490
not going to use it so i don't have to

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,220
belabor that point get others involved

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,920
and that means tell people what you're

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,860
doing and ask for their help and most

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,300
importantly when they say no ask again

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,310
because

00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,339
everybody I've worked with they all said

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,470
no the first time and you know

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,730
eventually you you asked them and they

00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,200
figure out what you're doing and they

00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,260
figure out how it works for them and

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,630
then they become active participants so

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,940
you'll get a lot of no's funding we have

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,290
to find ways to fund these things for

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,360
Ross industrial that was through the

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,640
consortium I don't know that there's any

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,810
magic to this I think for everybody is

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,490
going to be different so I'm not going

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,130
to talk too much about it and then

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:28,100
ultimately you will benefit right you as

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,810
the person who creates it and you as the

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,630
people that are part of that group you

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,910
will benefit in you know probably

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:40,610
similar ways that Southwest Research has

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:43,220
but in other ways too so what's the

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,740
importance of these programs why why am

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,490
i up here saying hey you should start an

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,560
open source program we all have Ross we

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,290
can all use the Ross wikis we can use

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,170
the users group isn't that good enough

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,940
well first off like i said if i go look

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,620
at something like web tools and i see

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,390
there are five people standing behind it

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,329
there are multiple lines of support

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:07,399
that's important to me they're not

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:09,800
that's not necessarily true of all the

00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,820
packages with in Ross and so even if

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,680
there was something better than

00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,060
something like web tools i'm going to

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,540
use web tools because it has that

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:20,870
support it also provides opportunities

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,329
that for for investment all right and

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,649
this is very important this is why I you

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,070
know I think Ross industrials unique

00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:31,010
because we focused on a market but it

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:34,130
allows people in that industry or that

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:36,290
market to say okay now I understand what

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,270
my investment is going to buy so when we

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,010
go and talk to people about why they

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,020
should join Ross industrial we talk

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,720
about the applications that is going to

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,670
enable and even though everybody in this

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,640
room is smart enough to look at ross and

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,800
say oh i can do all these things if you

00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,250
don't if you don't market that right and

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,019
you don't focus on what is really

00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,310
important to people and part of that is

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:01,370
creating this program let's

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:04,070
market-focused that message will get

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:06,600
lost and it's going to be very difficult

00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,600
for you to end up getting

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,759
getting funding now I know there are

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,980
some companies like Google and you know

00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,259
everybody on this list over here who

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,730
understands the power of Ross but those

00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:19,949
are few and far between there are a lot

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,300
more companies out there that if you if

00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:26,730
you approach them in the right way

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:28,500
they'll fund things one of the other

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,529
things that I think is important is that

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,779
these groups can then push back on the

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:36,959
core Ross development and say this is

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,790
what we need so a lot of our members

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,430
within the Ross industrial consortium

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:45,810
they tell us that they need a robust

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,060
reliable core so we can push back on OS

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:51,079
RF and say this is what our members say

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,050
they need it's what what we we think we

00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:57,630
should focus on and even better we can

00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,430
take some of the membership fees and

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,759
dues and fund some of that development

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:04,709
in OS RF otherwise it's not very likely

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,490
that anybody would have went to OS RF

00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:09,480
directly and given them funds and

00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,930
finally when you work in a large group

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,639
like that you'll see lab ratings will

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,670
force you to consider broader

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,970
applications and you'll end up with a

00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:27,089
much you know generic or multi-purpose

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:29,339
library when in the end so in conclusion

00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:32,819
I think everybody should consider

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:35,339
starting or joining a program i think

00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:37,470
you should be active participants and

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,540
you know because you're here you're

00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,600
likely at least somewhat active but i'd

00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,709
encourage you to take a more active role

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,259
get involved with some of these groups

00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:48,720
and start some of them on your own I

00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,180
think market focus programs are very

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,939
important and I put three examples up

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,709
there that I've talked to people about

00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:57,720
but there doesn't seem to be a group

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,660
within the Ross community that's

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,339
coalescing around these topics

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,620
autonomous vehicles micro air vehicles

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,740
and medical robots these are all

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,780
important market areas that could have

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:15,480
groups similar to Ross industrial

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:18,449
associated with them I think one of the

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,650
reasons to do these groups is if you

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:20,880
start one of these groups

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,130
you're one of the core members you'll

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,200
benefit in the ways in in various ways

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,770
but certainly ways that that southwest

00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,180
research benefited from Ross industrial

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,440
but I do believe if you're going to do

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,860
something it should help the whole

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,380
community and I think these groups do

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,000
they they focus attention on Ross they

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,220
bring in people who otherwise wouldn't

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,720
be interested in Ross through these

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:48,270
market focused efforts and I think all

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,550
programs all the existing ones today

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,730
should should be encouraged to be more

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,490
open and involve the community a lot

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,050
more and you know I can point back at

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,090
Ross industrial and say we don't do this

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:02,940
enough and that's part of the reason why

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,580
I'm here is to engage all of you and say

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,770
if you have interest let me know I want

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,780
I want you two to be part of the Ross

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,610
industrial community and I think other
