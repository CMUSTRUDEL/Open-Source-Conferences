well good morning I thank you all for

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,630
coming this is it's great to have you

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,639
all here it's a ross count 2013 when we

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,440
many of you were a trois con 2012 last

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,020
year and when we did it we weren't

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,730
really sure if people would show up if

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,170
we put on a conference and it turns out

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,609
a bunch of people did and then we did a

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,039
survey and they said they wanted to do

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,019
it again next year so here we are and

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,310
thank all of you in particular for

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,859
coming out and spending your weekend

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,710
doing this it's a it's kind of a

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,989
peculiar little niche that we live in

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,160
with open source robot software and it's

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,579
great to see that it's important enough

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,710
to all of us to come together and and

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,870
spend time on a weekend talking about

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,200
this particular thing many of you were a

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,000
ticker this week and so our hope is that

00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,070
Ross Khan is kind of the perfect

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
complement to occur where ikura has the

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,610
place to discuss a lot of the scientific

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,320
algorithmic development that's going on

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,850
in the community Ross Khan is the place

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,160
to talk about the engineering the

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,710
software the infrastructure that's that

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,460
enables all that scientific progress

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,310
that we see at a crow we'd like this to

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,580
be fun we'd like this to be interactive

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:13,860
please ask questions of the speakers

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,560
please go see all the sponsors in the

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,850
exhibit area and please you know get

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,420
together and talk with each other this

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,369
is as much as it is an opportunity to

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,590
come here and see people give you talks

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,270
on what they've been working on it's an

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,880
opportunity for us as a community to

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,310
meet to get to put faces to names and

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,990
even maybe to hack together we've got

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,659
space dedicated in the exhibit area

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,909
where you can if you've brought robots

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,170
bring your robots out maybe there's an

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,770
opportunity to actually write some code

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,259
this weekend which would be fantastic so

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,590
some thank yous we couldn't do this

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,710
without our fantastic list of sponsors

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:54,570
some of these names are there from last

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,710
year so we've got we've got multi-year

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,630
support coming from some of these

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,540
organizations which were very happy

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,399
about some of them are new supporters

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,790
which is also fantastic i'd really like

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,170
to highlight our hosts fraunhofer we

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,599
just heard from professor professor

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,069
farrell and we wouldn't be able to do

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,020
this without professor Farrell thank you

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,840
to him and also

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,760
let me just jump to the organizing

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,170
committee this is a group of people who

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,370
have spent time over the last several

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,500
months putting the conference together

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,890
and I'd really like to thank my fellow

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,080
organizers in particular Alex and

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,850
Florian our local hosts without whom

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,010
none of this would have happened we

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,750
showed up last night and pretty much

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,980
everything was done and I can say that

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,660
that was a very big change from last

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,180
year where we showed up and had to kind

00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:50,370
of do everything so very happy about

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:52,170
that yeah thank you I'd also like to

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,700
thank the program committee so I

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,770
couldn't get pictures of everybody on

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,840
one slide but this is the group of

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,770
people who reviewed the proposals that

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,570
we got in so as you know to decide who

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,550
gets to speak at the conference we take

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,530
in proposals we go through a review

00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,650
process and this is the group of people

00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:12,210
who carefully review the proposals put

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,040
in recommendations hopefully got

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,960
meaningful feedback to those of you who

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,360
who put in proposals whether it was

00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,570
accepted or not we hope that that

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,400
feedback was helpful for you and it is

00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,110
the result of the work of that group of

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,420
people that put together the program

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,160
we're doing it a little bit different

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,130
this year we're going to do singletrack

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,810
in the mornings in here so this is this

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,340
is the room for track one so if you look

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,230
on the schedule talks that are track one

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,850
or in here and then after lunch we'll

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,709
split into two tracks so we're doing

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,170
longer talks in the morning and hear the

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,480
shorter talks will be double tracked in

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,310
here and in the other auditorium which

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,720
is not the next one over it's the one

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,280
after that but if you follow the signs

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,840
you'll you'll get there if you end up in

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,850
an empty auditorium that's that's the

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,290
wrong one we've got a great distribution

00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,760
of talks this year so we've got some

00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,610
longer talks on core pieces of

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,470
technology so basic libraries that

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,930
you're going to learn a lot more about

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,250
the design the motivation and how to use

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,920
them and then some really interesting

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,380
application talks so people using Ross

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,320
in a broad variety of ways including

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,120
lots of ways that we had no idea that

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,800
they might be able to use it when we

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:25,380
were designing the system years ago more

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
of the program which is in your in your

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,930
Ross bag

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,150
oh you know what I'll stop here and

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:33,509
point out Damon Cola right here from

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,469
google is the person who designed he

00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,509
didn't know he was doing it but he

00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:38,009
designed the swag so the ross bag and

00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:48,449
the ross topic pub on the pint glass

00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:49,830
that's thanks to Damon ok after the end

00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,919
of the talks today we're going to do

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,689
lightning talks this is a really fun

00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,009
session that we did last year and by

00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,240
popular demand we're going to do two

00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,110
sessions so we're gonna have one this

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,779
afternoon and one tomorrow afternoon the

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,310
way this works is you need to find the

00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,469
Lightning session chair for the day

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,069
today that's Matt Williamson he's

00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:12,689
sitting right here so between now and

00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,210
the end of the afternoon break you need

00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:16,949
to find matt and tell him that you want

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,379
to talk today in the lightning talk

00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,699
session and then if you want it's not

00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,469
required but if you want you can give

00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,479
him up to three slides that he's going

00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,289
to assemble into some common deck and

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,610
then we're going to run the

00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,729
presentations up here off of one

00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:31,199
computer if you've got videos will try

00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,509
to take them we can't promise the lull

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,889
playback and if there's any hassle with

00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,199
it we're just we'll just skip your

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,050
videos the idea what the lightning talks

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
is to stand up and tell the whole crowd

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,649
about some interesting project you're

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,839
working on maybe it's a research project

00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:47,009
maybe it's a cool new tool that you've

00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,069
developed that you want people to try

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,659
out maybe it's a call for something that

00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:52,919
you should you think should be added to

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:56,219
the software week of each software

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,259
ecosystem that we all rely on so it's

00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:59,939
wide open any any topic is fair game

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,800
just find Matt before the end of the day

00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,360
and then we'll do it again if you don't

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,039
get in today will be first come first

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,969
serve if you don't get in today we'll do

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,759
it again tomorrow there is a

00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:13,379
questionnaire in your bag we're looking

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,199
for feedback on the organization of the

00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,810
conference please do take the time to

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,330
fill that out that's how we get feedback

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,719
on how we've done and we'll incorporate

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,339
that into what we do next year so please

00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,169
please do take the time to fill out that

00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:31,620
questionnaire and get it back to where

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:33,419
does it go to the registration desk so

00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,769
please sometime this weekend fill out

00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,209
the questionnaire drop it back off at

00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:40,550
the registration desk that'll help us a

00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:42,950
lot some numbers so

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:47,000
who are we this is a breakdown by

00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:49,940
registration type so we've got the so

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,570
the the non students are here about

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,550
forty three percent and students up here

00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,590
complimentary is a mix of the two so

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,560
complimentary registrations are often

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:04,280
students hobbyists individuals members

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,710
of the press also sponsor employees of

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,900
sponsoring organizations so the takeaway

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,900
