	00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:09,420
hello so yesterday morning Brian started

00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:12,120
he said uh it'd be great if we had some

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,940
hacking sessions at this Frost con and I

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,260
remember thinking I was like um when

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,320
we'll do that when will that happen

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,480
there's no time so Albert and I sat down

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,300
and actually mostly Albert did some

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,250
hacking and we got a move it to run on

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,449
Baxter's if you could play the video ah

00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,730
so first of all thank you very much

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,270
Chris uh I just went to the booth then

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:39,360
said could really give me aur DF of your

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,420
robot they did about 10 minutes later we

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,690
had move it running in simulation for

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,059
the Baxter and then with huh with a

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,090
little bit more help from Albert we

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,370
actually had it running in hardware

00:00:50,090 --> 00:01:07,799
that's about it it probably used one

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:10,229
minute and hi I'm yada Nevada and I'm

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,540
gonna talk a bit about using Ross for

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,580
planetary rover operations so we're

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,159
currently working on a European project

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,380
called faster which as you guess is

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,650
trying to improve the traversal speeds

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,310
of plant rear overs right now as with

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,250
curiosity and older Rovers they face a

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,560
lot of very mission-critical hazards so

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,070
all traverses are very carefully planned

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,960
by large teams of people and Mission

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,540
Control and what we're trying to do is

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,329
use a Scouter over a small lightweight

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,880
over to go ahead of the rover of the big

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,430
mission rover to try and detect any of

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,490
these hazards so the primary rover can

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,430
then move faster without taking care

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,850
that much and also do more autonomy so

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,170
as you see up there the primary

00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,869
components of the system are the main

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:03,180
primary Rover the scouter over a number

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,700
of sensors we're going to use the detect

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,479
hazards and the cooperative autonomy

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,610
system so the scouter over we are going

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,790
to keep it very very simple to make it

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,510
as small as possible

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,620
it's just going to do but following the

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,349
primary Rover is going to do all the

00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,849
perception planning and then give a path

00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,390
with Scout Rover which is going to

00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:28,810
follow and to do this we're planning on

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,640
using a combination of Ross with the

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,390
genome framework that was developed at

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,629
loss in France and you can see what all

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,970
goes into a prime into a space rover

00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:42,280
interplanetary over we're just going to

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,889
focus on three parts of this big

00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,200
architecture the task planning what our

00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:50,439
scheduling guidance navigation and

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,629
control which means mapping localization

00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,120
and Pat planning and then scout

00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:56,919
localization so trying to detect the

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,950
position of the scouter over from

00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:03,250
cameras on the primary over using image

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,459
processing techniques and of course

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,109
we're going to test it out on a

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,510
planetary rover that's there in the UK

00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:12,280
at astrium but before they allow us to

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,489
do this we have to test it in simulation

00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,250
so we're going to use gazebo or us our

00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,650
sim we still haven't decided and to

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,169
achieve this we've begun importing

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,229
actual terrain information from Mars

00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:29,290
into both simulators as well as

00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:31,120
developing the rover models for both the

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,239
scouter over and the planetary rover

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,129
itself anyway thank you and you can feel

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,609
free to contact me if you have any

00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,609
questions

00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,519
so hello everyone my name is Manny money

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,640
Jimmy from autonomy lab at Simon Fraser

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,659
University in Canada I'm the maintainer

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,810
of AR Drone had driver for Ross what I'm

00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,799
going to show you is a video of an

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:17,510
demonstration experiment that we did

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,030
last month in internal in this video you

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,710
will see a fully autonomous integrated

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:28,070
system of a human multi UAV interaction

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:31,120
mono Islam and visibility of exploration

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:34,660
and planning this is a this is a as

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,639
experiment is part of the Canadian why

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,039
my feet robotics network that we started

00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,740
just this year and Ross is out one of

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,600
our main candidates for doing system

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,000
integration between nine different

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,599
universities so the video is a sped up

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,849
so I talk instead of the human in the

00:04:50,599 --> 00:05:03,620
video so the human selector pixel robot

00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:07,070
says you name the robot your green picks

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,970
another robot says you and says you are

00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:13,740
rare and now as the green robot to take

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:20,400
off the robot now does

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:22,860
mano esta initialization went on the

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,720
user can engage with robot and ask the

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:33,360
robot to explore it's a certain

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:36,210
direction a specific direction now the

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,919
robot is doing visibility ever planning

00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:44,569
while doing slam now the the user has

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,569
the red robot to take off

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,660
again ask the robot to explore that

00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:04,080
direction and now we have two robots

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:07,960
doing exploration in the environment and

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:15,370
mapping and now the user has the red one

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:18,090
to come back to the base and now as the

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,090
robots to learn

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:56,580
thank you hi my name is yogesh and I'm a

00:06:52,710 --> 00:07:00,330
PhD student at McGill so what if you had

00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:02,790
robots which instead of sensing pixels

00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,860
and like low level sound wave forms they

00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,350
could sense the world in terms of oh

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,050
there's an object here I'm in this room

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:12,060
i am outside i'm inside and what if you

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,800
did not have to train them for every one

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,470
of these things that you want to detect

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,030
what if it could automatically learn

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:21,630
different ideas and objects which exists

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,730
in the world and and then you can make

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,950
your life easier further on to the so

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,500
the general idea behind the this

00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,800
pipeline I'm working on is that if

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,990
certain observations exist together in

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,670
space and time there's a there's a

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,650
chance there's a good chance they belong

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,660
to the common underlying cause so when

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,340
you always sees eyes and nose together

00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,620
you know there's a good chance that

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,070
there's a common thing which humans call

00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,300
this face that exists and that's

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,340
responsible for producing those

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,560
observation if you hear birds chirping

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,230
and like wind on our microphones there's

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,820
a good chance we are aware we are the

00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:01,890
khan the context of those observations

00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:04,560
is outside so so this perception

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:07,530
pipeline deals with automatically doing

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,780
this can you go to the next plane so the

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,880
way this works is that we bake bunch of

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,160
observations and we have a bunch of

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,620
these contexts which we call as topics

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,150
sorry for choosing the name topics

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,669
there's nothing to do with Ross topics

00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,820
and the goal is to represent what we

00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,260
observe in terms of these topics so

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,790
these topics are automatically learned

00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,040
these topics could be being outside

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:34,410
being different objects and each topic

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,660
is represented as a as models in terms

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,770
of low-level observations the

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:42,810
distribution of low levels of

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:45,630
observations so can you go so the

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:47,080
benefit of doing this is that you know

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,780
so this has several application

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,000
we can use this with both vision and

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,480
audio it could be used for things like

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,650
loup clothing i doing things like

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,330
summarizing all the data you have

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:04,030
detecting surprises and explore our tuna

00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,950
autonomously exploring the world now so

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:12,700
instead of talking I'll just show you a

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:14,290
bunch of examples of this running so in

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,800
this first example I'm just using audio

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,740
and those the histogram corresponds to

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,200
different contexts which the robot is in

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,500
so right now yellow was the lab so as we

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,870
go into stairs he'll change to the green

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,620
topic which automatically learned that

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:36,430
it corresponds to the stairs and can be

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:38,620
further in the video so here I'm doing

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,830
it the video and automatically robot

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,510
learns gives different parts of the room

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,340
a different color label which

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,230
corresponds to a different context here

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,990
i'm using the same framework for my with

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,180
my underwater robot and I'm doing all

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,790
what I told it to do was find the the

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,470
context which is the rarest and follow

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,340
it and all of a sudden we have a pet

00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:02,200
like robot which goes around chasing

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,010
surprising and interesting things thank

00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,010
you alright take it

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,370
okay hi my name is Kristin and I'm from

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,890
the computer vision group at the

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,500
Technical University of Munich and i

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,720
want to show some recent work we did on

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:37,060
Dennis Fisher Dmitri for a TBD cameras

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,060
so let's have a look at the first video

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,980
okay so here we have an IBD camera like

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,220
a kinect moving around the scene which

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,810
is represented by a certain little red

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,990
box and we actually want to estimate its

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,000
trajectory just from its images and so

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:59,060
standard approaches to visual Dimitri

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,020
extracts wise features and compute the

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,610
motion from this but in our approach we

00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:10,360
yeah use all image information to get

00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:12,920
more precise estimates ok back to slides

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,610
yeah so it's a frame to frame matching

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,890
method so we have no history so we have

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,750
a constant memory footprint nevertheless

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,940
it's highly accurate and we only have

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,210
built rift and the good saying is also

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,700
it uses all image information we can run

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:31,490
it on a CPA single CPU core at camera

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,900
frame rate and if you like to try it you

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,630
can download the source code from our

00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,090
github page and we already tried it on a

00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,470
quadrocopter and for a handheld connects

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,200
but it would be interesting to see how

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,490
it performs on other robots so if you

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,610
are unhappy with your current which

00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:52,550
Ottoman free give it a try ok and let's

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:54,470
have a look at our extensions to sirs so

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:58,790
here we integrated it into a full slam

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:01,610
system and its dead yeah it's the drift

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,860
correction and then 3d reconstruction

00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:07,370
and we obtained a yeah nice ready model

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,430
of our 40 x 10 meter floor at our

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,870
department and yeah and at this good at

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,530
the core of this algorithm Sarah's

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,830
sister densitometry method ok thanks for

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,830
your interest

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,600
hi I'm mr. Fernandez from bellflower in

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:39,440
Spain and from Griffith University in

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,190
Australia and I'm presenting a next

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,200
please a library called TX Ross pie

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:49,850
which is an asynchronous library for the

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,190
Roskam API and protocols it uses twisted

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:56,690
which is a basically an implementation

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:59,060
of the reactor part and well both are up

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,240
in serves you can use them and free to

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:06,560
use them and contribute and whatever and

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:09,950
also the reason I did the TX raspa

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,860
library was to to see how feasible was

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:20,210
to replace a part of the the Ross stock

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:24,170
for example with th for us no no no you

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:26,480
tickle yeah thank you and with TX raspa

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:30,430
you can replace to Spiros with another

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,020
RPC mechanism for example thrift or

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:37,300
replace TCP all together and use

00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:40,580
something more interesting like mqp and

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,820
thi is fully compatible with with

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:47,960
existing libraries like Ross cpp rushed

00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:53,360
by rough Ruby and I'm truth or any other

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:57,350
large yeah Rossi and yeah and here's a

00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,160
simple example and it looks it looks

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:04,040
sequential code but it's actually a

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,110
synchronous it's non blocking because

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,680
it's using something called the inline

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:14,930
callbacks decorator this is this is a

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,890
very simple example which this one is a

00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:22,730
bit more interesting you get server and

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:23,900
the response to requests doesn't block

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:28,520
at all

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:30,920
which is good for for servers that need

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:36,320
to accept several requests at the same

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:39,740
time and thank you please have a look at

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:56,480
the github page and contribute and well

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:59,270
tell me what you think good morning

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,110
everybody I want to introduce you rasta

00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:06,080
org and probably you know just kidding

00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:10,400
just one part of this that's highlighted

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,790
here it's mention that actuator level

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,570
control also can be done within bras but

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:20,080
in the later I want to show that

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:24,500
probably it's not a good idea next week

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,390
so if you have two rows one stands for

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,580
robot operating system and the other one

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:32,930
something based on real-time operating

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:35,780
system then it's better to divide the

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,600
tasks in this way actually all of the

00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:43,420
time-consuming tasks within Ross

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:46,430
platform which we need mostly

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,060
flexibility modularity and lots of

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:54,200
things to combine mediums with each

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,390
other but on the other hand for dead

00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,870
reckoning sensor fusion and any part of

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,180
control when we do it in Ross actually

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:06,170
the performance and smoothness of the

00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:10,480
final result it's not satisfying in

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:13,640
practice especially for example in

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,950
position mode control you will receive

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,050
lots of vibration in velocity mode

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:22,420
control you will receive imprecision

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:25,330
movements and for a complicated system

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:30,350
synchronization of the actuators becomes

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:34,490
painful next with so as an example I

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:36,850
have seen this chunk Powerball

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:40,730
actually it's not an advertisement but

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:44,120
the controller that chunk recommends is

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:49,240
kept a control which is based on a PLC

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:52,640
system but for an offer provided lots of

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,310
toolboxes within russ for operating with

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,149
that power ball which operates in 100

00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:03,010
Hertz compared to cable control which it

00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:07,809
operates 125 hertz but in our project

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:15,079
based on matlab code generation we

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:18,819
developed okay sorry that the last slide

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:25,400
was more important dating back please

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:29,960
okay a controller bit pandit up to 250

00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:32,230
Hertz but if you if you can see the all

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,860
three together which is not possible now

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:39,140
but in my craw conference we can see

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:42,020
that the controller provided by foreign

00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,450
offer was quite shaky it's not a

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,960
difference a big difference between

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:52,550
frequencies but usually the accuracy of

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,250
timer is not that much good so just not

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:59,000
about the speeds it's about accuracy of

00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:03,309
keeping the time about the way that we

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,090
implemented we published the article

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:07,090
thank you thank you

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,780
just play hi my name is Cameron fennekin

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,810
I'm from Cornell University and today

00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,070
I'd like to quickly introduce to you a

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,410
little map which is a toolkit for a

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,050
high-level robot control that works with

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:34,600
Ross so as I'm trigger all the way

00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,400
around has many powerful sensing and

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:39,160
actuation capabilities but the question

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,590
remains on how to combine these or use

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,120
these in a way to perform interesting

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,710
high level tasks so say you have a robot

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,350
and you want to have it be a restaurant

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,090
a waiter in a restaurant and it'll

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,710
receive customer orders from the two

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,530
customers above and below the table and

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:54,930
go to the kitchen and bring food to them

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,400
when it's ready when the food is ready

00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,600
so commonly one way to do this is just

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,130
to write a bunch of code the glues

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,120
together the low-level components but

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,100
the problem with this is that it's

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,690
time-consuming tedious and you don't

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,130
have really a guarantee that what you

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,170
wrote is actually what you intended to

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,730
have the robot do so the alternative

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,740
approach that i'd like to present here

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,330
the little mop uses is instead to write

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,650
your task is a specification in

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,570
structured English telling the robot

00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,340
what to do and what not to do and then

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,350
from this specification little mop

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,940
synthesizes a controller automatically

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:26,170
from the specification that is

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,640
guaranteed to satisfy the task so you

00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,640
can then use this controller to drive a

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,300
robot here we see a simulated pr2 and

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,250
gazebo using Ross performing this task

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,130
it's using om PL for motion planning and

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:42,160
just the standard pr2 libraries for

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,450
object detection and grasping it's not

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,130
the best waiter but it did what we asked

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,200
it to do so another really powerful

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,090
benefit of this approach is that if you

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,700
if there's any possibility that the task

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,010
you ask the robot to do might be

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,480
impossible for the robot to do little

00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,100
mop will fail to synthesize a controller

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,080
and we'll tell you about this problem at

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,280
compile time so this is an earlier

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,830
version of the specification you saw

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,690
before that's missing a key assumption

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,460
and what you can do then is little mop

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,020
has a tool that lets you analyze the

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,380
problem with the specification like this

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,150
so what you see here is this is a

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,410
two-player game that you are playing as

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,570
the robot trying to satisfy the

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,910
specification against an adversarial

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,310
environment so we've received an order

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,690
from a customer and we're trying to go

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,390
to the kitchen to fulfill

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,890
to get the food to fulfill this order

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,060
but what we see here when we go to the

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,620
kitchen and try to pick it up the tool

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,140
tells us there's a conflict with the

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,610
action that we just tried to do with

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,920
part of our specification where we said

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,210
don't pick up food until it's ready so

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,280
by playing a game like this we can gain

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,320
insight into the problem of unrealized

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,300
bility of our specification then go back

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,090
modifier specification and resynthesizer

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,560
to form a controller that will work and

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,450
because this task specification is high

00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,860
level just by swapping out the low level

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,980
controllers you can have the exact same

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:57,250
task run on and pretty much any robot

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,740
this is a now doing the same thing in

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:03,040
our lab it's also sort of a mediocre

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,480
waiter but it's pretty cool so please

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,850
check out our website we'd love to have

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,960
you try it out give us feedback and I

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,820
also want to mention this is joint work

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,040
with gang Yun Jing last method ramen

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:22,420
head asterisk is eat and Catherine long

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:24,520
thank you hi good afternoon my name is

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,880
Victor my abilities I'm the project

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:30,580
manager at early so just a quick survey

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,880
who here would like to have its robot on

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,890
its pocket well I would love to and

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,650
that's exactly what we are doing at

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,920
early project we are trying to make a

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:45,790
micro aerial robot a quadcopter small

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,620
size here you have basically the size of

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,470
our current prototype which is being

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,520
fabricated right now all right we're

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,100
trying to integrate different

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,970
technologies and standards set such as

00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:02,590
for example Wi-Fi Bluetooth USB and

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:04,240
stuff such as Ross leaners right now we

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,840
are eight students from different

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,910
backgrounds and levels working on it we

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,650
have mechanical engineers our spatial

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:14,050
engineers we have electrical engineers

00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:18,160
computer scientists and so on even guys

00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,020
girls from marketing and business etc we

00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,880
are really passionate about this and we

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,090
are definitely open to any kind of

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,190
collaborations investment whatever so

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,320
please guys if any of you just feel like

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:34,080
collaborating come to me and I will be

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,080
looking forward to whatever thanks

00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:49,000
you can play hello I mean Gabrielle

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,770
Habiru from the group of robot is

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,540
automation control and automation of

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:59,710
federal university of engineer and the

00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:02,200
new platforms of the oil company in

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:05,500
Brazil Petrobras will be so far of the

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,910
cost that we can't get to there with a

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:13,330
helicopter and get back to the coast so

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:15,900
one of the alternative is that put some

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,270
habits to operate this platform

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,060
unfortunately we can't put the hobbits

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:25,510
on platforms just to test it so we

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,630
propose that simulation with relish

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:31,630
visualization of induced relaxing

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:36,030
ambience on the platform it's been

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:40,450
developed it with my group and such

00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:45,280
associated groupid that on Rio Janeiro

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:51,490
it's based on Unity game engine running

00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:55,060
now on Windows and have several auxiliar

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:58,860
visualizations to the robots the rabbits

00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:02,050
and the sensors uses Raj messages so its

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,620
standard and it's straightforward to use

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:11,470
it with it order the packets that you

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:16,630
are now for the community and we aim to

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:20,970
usages same message to control the real

00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:23,620
robots then we can use the robots on

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,410
real environment and virtual

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:31,620
environments at the same time and use it

00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:35,140
things like a 3d visualization of the

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:40,720
images with it immersion of the operator

00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:43,299
and the robots doing the same movement

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,840
that we can make it

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:54,820
control some valves or objects on the

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:59,789
visceral environment and this is a top

00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:03,039
sizes simulation now we start to do some

00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:09,669
underwater simulation with you are elvis

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:14,259
and will be up for colleges and this is

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:20,590
a simulation of the Oded door motor man

00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:23,200
and the Nexus Nexus part will show our

00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:26,259
real Mata men during the same movements

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:49,059
with the same message so it can be done

00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:52,509
at the same time okay thank you today I

00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:54,970
drag to advertise appetizer and epic

00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:57,129
manager ap peaches is an Android

00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,299
application and deputy manager is a

00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:03,159
roast package and they are useful for

00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:05,730
migrating some kinds of robots and

00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:09,100
application in your unified manner and

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:12,369
briefly the function of a PP manager is

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:16,179
to supervise applications on its robots

00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:19,419
and a function of appt sir is intact

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:24,100
with APD manager and you can install the

00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:28,570
appt sir from google play next I'll tell

00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:32,559
you how to use them grunts appt sir push

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:36,700
other other other robot then you can see

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:39,669
the pop-up window to connect you have to

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:44,409
get Ross master URI and there are three

00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:47,769
methods and zeroconf if it is a new

00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:50,269
function of updated appt sir you can get

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:56,419
all all the robots

00:26:50,269 --> 00:27:01,339
on the local area network them you can

00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:03,440
see the robot wrist so electron and the

00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:07,700
next you can see and get an application

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:12,619
waste epping manager provides memories

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:17,659
three services rest APIs in forms a

00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:22,879
parable application and pretty protect

00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:28,039
one them you can run the daughter on

00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:31,969
fire in circuits packets and you can

00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:34,669
also include the information of cry

00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:43,729
necessary client android application and

00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:49,089
then it is also runs and finally also

00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:49,089
use simple demo by using eight pitches

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:16,099
in this task pier to pick up the coffee

00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:24,709
come from a freeze and now that robot is

00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:33,649
a site opiate and two tones at a turbot

00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:37,570
and the total BOTS automatically sends a

00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:37,570
coffee can to the master

00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,730
I can drink it stink

00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,800
yeah hi my name is Jeff and Kolkata from

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:57,350
tu Darmstadt encourage the team leader

00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,120
of team Hector darmstadt we are involved

00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,160
Robocop rescue and you might have used

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,700
some of our packages which are all

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,200
prefixed with Hector or whatever yeah I

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,790
wanted to give a short overview what we

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,130
do in Robocop rescue and what you

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,740
Robocop rescue community is doing so

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,690
what is Robocop rescue it's a

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,420
competition and their robots have to

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,060
explore simulated disaster environments

00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:22,670
in that regard it's a little bit similar

00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,770
to the DAPA Robotics Challenge minus be

00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,950
more crazy parts like using humanoid

00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,480
robots for that stuff and so on so yeah

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,620
and I know because I'm involved in both

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,210
of these competitions so yeah so what we

00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,370
do have to do is learn maps of

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,250
environments we don't have a map prior

00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:42,910
to getting our robots in there we have

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:46,310
to find simulated victims and manipulate

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:50,270
the environment or also observe using

00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:52,340
robot arms for example and you can use

00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,170
both autonomous I tell operated robots

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,520
and as you can see in these pictures the

00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:57,830
environments are pretty challenging

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,690
because you have a lot of obstacles and

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,640
your walls will fall over it's not flat

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,480
ground like you have in mobile

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:09,710
manipulation oftentimes so the next

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:12,260
slide so the issues we face in Robocop

00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,570
rescue is a reinvention of the wheel so

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,220
with the Boston co-chairing everyone try

00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:18,530
to develop their own slam stuff for

00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,330
example and a wide range of challenges

00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,280
so there's a lot of teams with a

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,530
mechanical engineering background that

00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,020
just don't do a lot of software stuff so

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:28,790
the idea is that the software teams have

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,250
out the mechanical engineering teams and

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,830
vice versa so there's an initiative by

00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,080
the Robocop rescue community to provide

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:38,210
basic building blocks for user robots

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,680
based on Ross and they have been events

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:44,540
in the past in the last two years and

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,550
there's also an upcoming event in Sweden

00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,100
and yeah we have a small video of how

00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:52,240
the how everything looks like this is

00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:55,580
from the Robocop drum and open

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,090
from the world cup German no competition

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,490
and this is our robot exploring the

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,740
environment fully autonomously the

00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:05,510
operator just told it that it has met

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,850
the victim correctly and now the robot

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:10,430
is going on with exploration of the

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:12,440
environment these laser beams you are

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,360
seeing our distance queries into the

00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,510
optimum we are using because we are also

00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:21,320
mapping all these QR codes located in

00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:23,330
the environment and most of that a lot

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,370
of that stuff here's available as open

00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:29,510
source also two other teams or to you of

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:31,400
course to and also of course also

00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,100
challenging because we decided to have

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,430
an a command steered robots oh yeah

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,950
turning around is a non-trivial task

00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,600
there but using a combination of

00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:46,190
different planning libraries that works

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,170
pretty well so oh yeah and the full 20

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:49,640
minutes of our final mission are

00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:55,540
available on youtube so if you want to

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:55,540
see more of that you can do that ok

00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,160
hi my name is hagwon I'm from Georgia

00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,840
Tech the healthcare robotics lab that my

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,030
talk is to just do it with Ross

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,210
commander it's a collaboration with

00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:22,360
Mateo Jen willow and it's a little bit

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:24,420
of a jab and move it guys so the problem

00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:28,180
that I'm interested in is getting

00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,070
general-purpose robots to do multiple

00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,890
tasks so we have all sorts of methods

00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:36,730
that work well for a single task on a

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:38,860
single on the single purpose device and

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,390
a single task on general purpose robots

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,610
so if you want to say like do door

00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,890
opening or pick up an object from the

00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,530
table we have lots of good analysis

00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,810
methods for that so to address this

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:51,670
challenge I introduce this interface

00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:54,010
call Ross commander so have you imagined

00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,290
Photoshop as a good interface on top of

00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,000
a lot of Peter vision algorithms this is

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,760
an interface on top of a lot of

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,740
manipulation related algorithms so the

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,290
important thing about this is it uses

00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:09,400
the robot in the loop so you can see

00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:12,310
here it's kind of it's representing the

00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,620
behaviors that the robot that we

00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,360
construct with a finite state machine

00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,190
but the important things that we have a

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,540
robot in the loop so that when we finish

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:22,060
constructing the state machine we know

00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,010
that it works in the real world and the

00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,770
thing that makes this work is that a

00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:28,690
state machine is kind of from previous

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:33,790
work in mobile manipulation and working

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:37,020
graphics and it seems like a state

00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:42,540
machine is kind of at the right level of

00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:45,490
complexity so this is just a set of

00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:49,300
tasks that we've been able to do on our

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:51,640
PR to with these met with Ross commander

00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,790
so on top you see the pr2 opening a

00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:57,310
fridge with both arms and its base and

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:59,560
from this basic set of parameters herbal

00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:02,020
modules we we've been able to put

00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,970
together a lot of complex behaviors so

00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,160
here the PRTs handing over an object to

00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:08,879
a person is using tactile sensors in its

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,349
hands as well as parameterizing

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,899
trajectory with respect to the face

00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:17,279
detective so the there's a light switch

00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:20,129
operating a light switch and operating a

00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:23,250
drawer so what we found out with this is

00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:25,829
that a lot of tasks in home because of

00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,839
the way home mechanisms is structured

00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:29,609
that they don't have a lot of pose

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,990
variation so once you have to pose in

00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:36,690
the robot basically most of your house

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:40,019
you can automate so this is another

00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,730
example of what happens if you you bring

00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:46,079
a robot into a home and you make it

00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:48,480
available to everyone so in conclusion I

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,450
think that we focus on developing

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,129
methods for operating multiple tasks on

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:56,819
general purpose robots we can go really

00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:58,680
far and the important thing for such

00:34:56,819 --> 00:35:02,369
things is to test our behaviors and real

00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,859
robots and that household mechanisms are

00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:09,559
low-hanging fruits because of small tuna

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:09,559
post variations and that you know Oh

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,650
hi I'm Dave Coleman from the University

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,340
of Colorado Boulder and i would like to

00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:28,480
announce an open-source robot platform

00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:30,310
for manipulation it's the clam arm and

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,670
clam stands for cheap little R

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:36,520
manipulator because it's it's under two

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,200
thousand dollars and it's it's gots

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,750
problems because for that chief of

00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,220
hardware your tolerances and your

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,920
accuracy of picking place kind of

00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:47,080
commands could use some and some

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,030
improvement so I present this to you

00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,290
guys as a version 1 and anyone who's

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,720
interested in this kind of thing I

00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,340
encourage you to make a version two this

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,870
could be some inspiration from the

00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,580
turtlebot arms you guys recall but

00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:02,230
they're actually developed at the same

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:04,600
time roughly so next slide this one it

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:07,090
uses dynamics of servos like many ARMs

00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,890
do it's got 3d printed parts delrin all

00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,030
the instructions to builder online you

00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,920
could buy the parts on the shape way

00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:15,220
road narrows website sells a kit that

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,960
has it all and so I just want to open

00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,810
the discussion that you know open source

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,730
hardware next slide and then also to me

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,620
more importantly as the software side it

00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,060
it has the whole move it software stack

00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,430
and it's actually been running it since

00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,870
November it used to be armed and I've

00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,820
ported it i want to encourage all of you

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:33,070
guys to port your arm navigation

00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,480
software to move it as well so that more

00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:37,750
people are collaborating and working

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,510
together on improving bugs and such and

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,490
move it and moving on with it in this

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:45,280
picture we have it working in simulation

00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:46,810
grasping picking place this house has

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,220
the perception show can detect it it's

00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,990
kind of fully autonomous for that and

00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:52,450
finally there's a video to prove that it

00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,070
kind of works this was back in january

00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,600
so there's been improvement since but i

00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:58,600
don't have a video but again this is

00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,340
good for do yourself hackers teaching we

00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,500
use this in our curriculum teaching

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,180
advanced robotics so i throw that out

00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,870
there to you guys and whatever happens

00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,870
to me thank you

00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,890
hello I'm nurses Palmeiras I'm from the

00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,200
underwater robotics research center from

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:23,590
the University of Girona catalonia and

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,390
i'm here to present the little bit about

00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,950
the underwater robotics because under

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,890
what the community else exists is not

00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,030
the most popular one but we also exist

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,640
we have been develop at underwater

00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,560
vehicles for the last 15 years as some

00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,870
of them have been done for research

00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,360
projects some other have been done four

00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:42,550
teams of students in my university in

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,750
Girona and we basically to participate

00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,730
to the students autonomous underwater

00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,800
challenge Europe this is a student

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,770
competition that you have to bring your

00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,590
own underwater vehicle we win the we

00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:57,490
want the the first edition in 2006 and

00:37:53,590 --> 00:38:00,490
we also one in 2010 this is not a

00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:02,530
students made vehicle this is a vehicle

00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:05,190
that we have been developed at the last

00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:09,010
two years it's for research projects it

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:11,410
contains an eye center suite and it's it

00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,220
can go up to 500 meters depth this

00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:16,900
vehicle is totally versified what we

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,340
what we do with with these kind of

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,410
vehicles with underwater vehicles

00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:24,160
basically we asked to the vehicle to

00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:26,140
submerge 20 until the devil of the sea

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,510
and when it is close to the to the sea

00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:34,210
bottom it started a long mover in a

00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:36,970
Prada finite area and in this area doing

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:40,870
this long mover it takes images and I

00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:42,520
also records acoustic sensors then when

00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,770
it come back to the surface if it come

00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,480
backs we take all this data and try to

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,700
do bathymetric maps to the Messiah

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,730
Keynes through the Messiah Kings also we

00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,920
have did a very nice experiment lately

00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,870
that is attached an arm to the our

00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,670
vehicle it was nice because our vehicle

00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:59,590
was running its own architecture that

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,470
aren't running the other architecture

00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,810
and they just share a roast master and

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:07,690
everything worse nice we recover a black

00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,950
bot in in a bullet in a good conditions

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,830
but we were able to do these

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,660
autonomously and finally just if you

00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,420
want to see our architecture is totally

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,610
open source it in big bucket and you can

00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,280
download else ouw seem that is if you

00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,590
don't know it

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,870
underwater simulator also based on Ross

00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:27,130
and test2 little bit with our vehicle

00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:29,720
also if you know a little bit about the

00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,360
robot Posey cadet we have developed

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,450
another kind of robotic I if it's called

00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,520
positive aslam it's similar but with six

00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,200
degrees of freedom it also interview can

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,060
introduce EMU twist and post-standard

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,310
message and in the output is una dama

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,410
tree and if you are able to identify a

00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:47,840
landmark and give the relative position

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:59,420
with your landmark you have the Islamic

00:39:47,840 --> 00:40:01,670
for free thank you hi everyone my name

00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,710
is Gavin I in my spare time I run the

00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:05,660
robots and dinosaurs the Sydney hacker

00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,830
space so I'm coming from a bit of a

00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,390
different point of view than most people

00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:10,340
here this isn't an actual educational

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:12,130
institution it's just a hobbyist club

00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,390
its people having fun on the weekends

00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,680
you can see some of their workshop there

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:20,000
we share the workshop with people who

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,070
actually make r2d2's and Daleks we've

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,930
got a wide variety of people wide

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:27,500
variety of interests 3d printing laser

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:30,890
cutting sewing all sorts of interesting

00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:33,230
bits and pieces so I was hacking on the

00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,880
turtle but in the space and a lot of

00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,200
people were asking me you know what is

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,850
it how could get started on the rest of

00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,830
it and there was enough interest we

00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:43,010
decided to run a workshop i just thought

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,330
i'd share what went on and i'd highly

00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,070
encourage people to do it even in an

00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:49,700
informal situation because there's a lot

00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:51,290
of interest so the background is our

00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,120
members there's really no commonality

00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,980
between them we have people that are

00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,480
have actually submitted a lot of stuff

00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:00,250
to the linux kernel we have people have

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,240
never touched a command line they're

00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,100
basically we had to make some of them

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,850
sort of one-size-fits-all fits into a

00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,590
day do whatever we could so basically

00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:11,290
have a bit of a mixture mixture bit

00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,850
mixture of theory bit of extra practice

00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,350
every time we did an exercise we

00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,660
followed up with what I call shameless

00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:19,700
bribery so it's winter explain the

00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:22,040
concept of topics it's published about

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,480
on the topic okay it's out there first

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,690
person to find it on the network gets a

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,800
chocolate

00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:30,610
the technique worked really really well

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,560
I highly recommend it so basically it

00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,480
was just sort of cover as much as we can

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,160
really really quickly we had a couple of

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,770
total bots running around and my own one

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,950
which I call the turquoise bot next

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,750
slide what I recommend if anyone tries

00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:45,250
to do oh sorry if you don't want to do a

00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,570
workshop like this is have a very

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,980
standard machine configuration because

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:50,320
we had a lot of stuff running around at

00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:53,050
the last minute and making sure host IPS

00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,080
was set and all the rest of it ntp test

00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,910
your comments before all starts the

00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,530
robot inevitably gets flat so i just had

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,170
big extension cords plugged into it for

00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:04,270
most of the day and because we had such

00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:06,610
a diverse background i made sure to get

00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:09,340
linux cheat sheets the ross cheat sheet

00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:13,120
so everyone at least had a sort of

00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:15,180
common point of where to start I think

00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,350
that's pretty much it Oh following up

00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,640
obviously right in the workshop is one

00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,680
step but actually maintained in the

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,800
community is another so we started a

00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,730
Sydney local user group for us we're

00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,350
having regular meetings in the

00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:28,060
hackerspace and we're really encouraging

00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:30,490
people to bring along whatever robots

00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:32,800
they have and start tinkering away on it

00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,240
show people what they've done we have

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,100
two members that are still in high

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,260
school level 15 years old they both make

00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,820
their own robots they're actually

00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,080
irritating the good robots they're a lot

00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,330
better than some of the ones that we

00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,820
were working on ourselves so that's

00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:47,080
encouraging to see and the sort of

00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,100
tinkering nature and everything fits

00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,810
extremely well into a hackerspace

00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,400
environments so I'd encourage people if

00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:54,690
you haven't seen more ready to find your

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,690
local hacker space and say hi

00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:14,130
hello Ross users and developers my name

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,780
is John Barnes maybe know me this is

00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:17,100
just a last-minute lightning talk

00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,650
because I was talking to someone at

00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,000
lunch today and realized that I'd came

00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,590
across this website at one point

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,890
actually Ryan do you think you could

00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:29,520
pull that up just there's this website

00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:39,840
called bounty source and it's sort of

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:42,210
like I didn't see the joke so but anyway

00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,260
so it's sort of it has to sort of modes

00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,240
of interaction one of them is a

00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,000
Kickstarter like mode for open source

00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,770
software the other one is direct

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,800
integration with any bug tracker and

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:55,920
then you can just like pull out your

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,020
wallet and take five dollars out and put

00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,660
it down on a ticket and the first person

00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,180
who comes and satisfactorily closes that

00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,220
ticket gets that five dollars or the

00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,530
five or ten or some odd dollars anyone

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,540
else puts out on it so just I thought as

00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,580
an open source community this could be

00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,780
beneficial to us and instead of sending

00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,470
an email out on the list i figured i

00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,870
could stick it through loudspeakers so

00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:22,200
check it out suits you think i created

00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:23,790
the ticket for a smash took it that i

00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,530
haven't put any money down yet on yet

00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:27,990
but now that I've announced this maybe

00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:31,730
I'll go put some money on there and yeah

00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,730
I don't know maybe it'll work

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:46,339
husband my name is Ian Sherman I'm with

00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,740
bot & dolly in San Francisco we're a

00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:50,480
small company that is trying to build

00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:52,849
bridges between automation technologies

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,710
including industrial robots in the

00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:58,819
creative industry including film

00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:01,940
entertainment stage and that list is

00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:03,799
growing architecture as well so I'd like

00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,269
to share a little bit of what we're

00:45:03,799 --> 00:45:06,559
doing and then a couple thoughts of sort

00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,779
of lessons learned that might relate to

00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,240
some themes that have come up this

00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:14,499
weekend so here's an example of some of

00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,499
the projects we work on

00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:12,990
so we got our start in motion control of

00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,210
film cameras the word dolly and our name

00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,950
comes from film dolly which is the

00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,820
wheeled cart that is traditionally used

00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:22,890
to move a camera around the set and we

00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,780
learned that the same platform we built

00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,150
for that project was applicable to a lot

00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:30,270
of other areas some of what you've seen

00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:32,820
here so I guess a couple things I want

00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:36,060
to mention one we were early adopters of

00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:38,130
the ross bridge and robot web tools and

00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,599
we're big fans um something that

00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:42,000
surprised me that was really nice was

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,500
that Ross kind of provides the service

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,470
oriented architecture on the back end

00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:49,680
for you for free and so we're able to

00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:54,089
leverage some client-side tools things

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,339
like backbone j/s and knock out that can

00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:59,670
do rendering all in the client side so

00:46:56,339 --> 00:47:03,000
it was really nice not to have to serve

00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:06,050
any HTML from the server those might be

00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,480
things that you all want to explore

00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:14,460
another thing is uh can you I'm not

00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:16,980
ready for this one yet another thing is

00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,240
that this job that I didn't really know

00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,520
existed before I started working in

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,230
bottom dollar was that of a rigger in an

00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,240
animation pipeline so this is the person

00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:26,910
that builds tools for animators to work

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,440
with characters and there's some

00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:30,770
concepts there that have proven really

00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:34,349
useful to us and in sort of building

00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:37,109
expressive tools for motion control so

00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:39,420
rigor is used to allow in an animator to

00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:40,800
say blend between FK ctrl and ik control

00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:46,940
when a character's reaching out and then

00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,940
manipulating a doorknob okay three

00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:58,610
I'd love to show you that video after

00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,770
the talk if you're interested hi guys

00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:02,780
san andreas at a working in the robot

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:04,700
project at eth and this is something

00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,450
we've been working on off late which i

00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:07,450
would like to share with you

00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:33,150
yeah the vacuum our floors help us do

00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,430
great research are fun to play with and

00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:38,160
who knows may soon bring us breakfast in

00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:40,470
bed doing these things well requires

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,060
lots of computation and the smarter we

00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:45,240
want our robots to be the more

00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,160
computation and memory they need this

00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:50,250
means our robots are often heavy and

00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:52,440
expensive that's a problem there's a

00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:54,180
better way this new way means moving

00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,160
some of that computation away from a

00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:59,220
robot's into the cloud and that makes

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,040
learning smart robots much easier meet

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,320
Robbie the robot each morning Robbie

00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,700
prepares breakfast but he is frequently

00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,380
intimidated by all the different

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,120
breakfast foods he has trouble

00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,560
recognizing the many different items and

00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,170
finds it difficult to pick them up with

00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,180
this gripper in addition he has trouble

00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:16,530
placing the items on the table because

00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:19,110
each morning the chairs are in different

00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:21,480
positions blocking his path this means

00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:23,880
robbie takes five hours to set the

00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:27,810
breakfast table frustration rises

00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,910
something has to give one morning Robbie

00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:32,610
decides to try something new the provo

00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:34,440
earth cloud engine now Robbie can move

00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:36,630
some of his heavy computation into the

00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,460
cloud with the robot earth cloud engine

00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,780
Robbie can now take images of the

00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,690
different breakfast foods and ask the

00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,040
cloud to extract text and Marcos if he

00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,410
has not interacted with a particular

00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,390
item before he can run a graph simulator

00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:50,880
to figure out how he should pick it up

00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,620
with a robust cloud engine Robbie can

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,570
now take on many other tests throughout

00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:57,450
the house instead of only making

00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,990
breakfast Robbie is relieved and so are

00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:02,310
his housemates Robbie's friend Rosie is

00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:05,370
only equipped with an infrared sensor

00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:07,110
and a wireless module she just transmits

00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:09,020
ourselves a dater and the cloud takes

00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:12,030
care of the localization and mapping

00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:12,490
using the rover's cloud engine rose in

00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:14,470
Ravi

00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,930
now collaboratively build and share the

00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,690
map of the house now both of them have

00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:21,130
less trouble moving around the chairs

00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,750
with this accurate map and the robot

00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,000
earth cloud engine telling her where she

00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:27,880
is Rosie can help quickly collect all

00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,860
the crumbs under the breakfast table the

00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,080
next morning Robbie finishes setting the

00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,840
table in 50 minutes and Rosie finishes

00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,820
to vacuum the entire house and with his

00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,560
worries about buying expensive computers

00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,900
and constant system administration gone

00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,290
there owner Igor can focus on one who

00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:46,420
really loves to do building new robots

00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:51,160
the cloud at your service and on an open

00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:53,250
