okay good afternoon my name is Michael

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,810
Carrick and together with p.rico I'm

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,840
going to talk to you today a bit about

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,210
the more simulator and to give you a

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,130
first introduction about Mars I would

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,430
like to start with this a little video

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,740
clip that we did for a 1.0 release and

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,470
which will feature some scenarios that

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,140
are used where Mars is used all or all

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,789
over the world Morse is basically based

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,970
on the open source project blender which

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,250
perimeter primarily is a 3d modeler but

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,290
it also comes with a 3d game engine that

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,270
we use for our simulations and nice

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,890
thing about this game's engine is that

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,980
it comes with the pallet physics engine

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,899
engine integrated palette itself is also

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,780
on self state-of-the-art open source

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,180
physics library and as you can see in

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,950
the videos we got quite some different

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,680
robots different sensors different

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,559
actuators that you can use and they are

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,690
just shipped with Mars release and we

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,030
also got you an avatar as you can see

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,770
here which can be used to from human

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,040
robot interaction and really dynamically

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,500
change the environment in real time

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,990
that's better you can control this like

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:15,119
in the modern 3d 3d computer game like

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:17,850
for example GTA 4 or similar so i hope

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,110
this cut you up excited about Mars the

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,360
rest of the talk will be structured as

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,520
follows I will first give you a general

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,250
overview about the boss Mars project and

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,960
if a little examples about its usage and

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,960
timorous workflow on how to get you a

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,790
simulation then a Pyrrhic will take over

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,950
and if you some more details on our

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,210
technical side and also talk to you

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,079
about human robot interaction then

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,590
distributed simulations the most project

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,259
is a hundred percent open source project

00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,799
it uses a permissive VST like license

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,970
and just the two months ago we had our

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,920
1.0 release which included our about

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,130
thirty thousand lines of code mostly

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,229
written in Python Mars has a very active

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,680
community that developed out of

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,290
academics and it's mostly possible

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,780
populated by academics the project

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,650
itself was initiated atlassian RS into

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,319
loose in 2009

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,349
and as for now there are 0 but it

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:22,810
contains contribution for remote from

00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:25,930
over 12 code institutions worldwide and

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,829
for our Latin he says we had 15

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,819
different individual contributors and

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:37,870
over 630 commits in 2013 only we also

00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:41,709
have one more than 130 users on our

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,599
mailing list North uses class since more

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,430
space on Blender and palate you also

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,900
have toes open source communities which

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:52,239
are also very active so but I guess you

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,420
guys as Ross users you probably all know

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,970
or use Cebu as you remain in Maine

00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,939
simulator are probably also had a look

00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,200
at we BOTS but there might be also for

00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:05,530
some reason for you to have a close look

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,599
at Mars for myself for example what

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,180
attracted me to Mars was just a little

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,590
agree of realism since my research is

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,900
more or less focused on high-level

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,389
planning I didn't want to spend too much

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,180
time on a lower level perception stuff

00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:21,220
so that's really nice Morse it comes

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,930
with some high level sensors that you

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,060
can just use if you don't want to spend

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,040
time on object detection you you have a

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,079
high lessons for that you can even skip

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,419
navigation if you want more that's it

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,489
for you I also a great plus for me verse

00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,449
the year the human avatar since I really

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:36,609
want to change my environment

00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:38,949
dynamically in real time while the robot

00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:42,340
performs things I can just like in the

00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,810
3d computer game controller human to

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,889
pick a place actions open closed doors

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,510
switch light on the switch lights on and

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,870
other features of Mars it's it's

00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,970
completely hackable via piping uses open

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:58,269
source projects only so you can heck

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:00,819
basically anything also lender for

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,000
modeling is a plus especially since in

00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:07,030
the last year glenda really evolved and

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,250
palate physics I'll count test that as a

00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,220
plus two I know there's always some

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:16,120
arguments between the I let oh de but

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,560
I'll leave this topic for now Mars also

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,719
middle very independent so you can

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,660
control different robots using different

00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:23,610
middle class on a different

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,890
uterus since it supports imaginal

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:30,420
simulation so too if you have an example

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,430
of what you exactly would have to do

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,160
with you get your simulation environment

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,250
running with Moore's a lot us imagine

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,470
you would like to do the mapping of a

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,360
kitchen environment before a pure to

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,600
robot and I mean a 2d mapping in this

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,720
case I want to show you what you would

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,420
have to do on the more side so first

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,900
thing to do is which is nice name in my

00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,230
case I choose Pure Food Kitchen since it

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,270
make sense and it only type open the

00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,420
console and run must create pr2 kitchen

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,200
Morris takes care of the rest it gives

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,120
produces an environment where you

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,780
couldn't put your scripts your robot

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,180
sorry you're basically your definition

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,240
of the end of your simulation inside it

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,860
also creates a default py file which is

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,230
basically the place where we define our

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,390
simulation as you already see from the

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,000
ending its fighting so you can use basic

00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,580
Titan to describe your simulations in

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,130
our example it would look like that our

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,680
first line to import our API front that

00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,780
is provided by Morse on the second and

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,900
third line we add a peer to robot and

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,520
say we want to control the buyer Ross

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,169
since you know its basic pipe and you

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,970
could as well just enter a loop and at

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,940
10p are two robots we did that a no

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:47,280
problem afterwards we had some sensors

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,650
in this case for in mapping we had an

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,320
odometer sensor and also control it by

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,060
Ross edited robot and I also add like

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,060
keyboard sensor here since while mapping

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,200
I want to draw a roadway on a keyboard I

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,060
should mention here I could also just

00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,650
add a motion controller and use peer to

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,780
till your keyboard but there for

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,150
convenience i want llendo do the work

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,460
for now I also at the whole cuyo sensor

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,640
that specially sent the laser scanner on

00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,010
the base of the pr2 and on the last line

00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,890
I'll load custom 3d model of my

00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,750
environment and that's basically

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:21,810
everything this is all the curl you will

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,160
need to get your you're here to make

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,430
your environment with standard brush

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,080
tools we now run our robots a publisher

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,950
publisher and Ross we're on shipping and

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,870
type mores run pr2 kitchen and we can

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,490
control a robot while the keyboard

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,840
driver

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,970
and create a 2d map of course the same

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,220
environment we could as well just run a

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:50,150
mcl localization and localized our robot

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:54,110
in morris and if you want to go one step

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,090
further and you want to do navigate move

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,099
on robot the only things we would have

00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,840
to add verse three lines of code in our

00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:03,139
builder script which is a motion

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,970
controller that move pays can use to

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:08,150
control our robot like on the real

00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:11,360
appear to again set Ross is our

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:15,080
interface added to the robot and we have

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:22,789
our robot oh sorry and we have our robot

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:24,229
navigating in the environment this is

00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:25,729
basically all we have to do to get your

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,699
simulation running is really sure it's

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:31,430
easy and you can do it using Python and

00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:32,960
now for a more technical parts I will

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,610
head over to Pyrrhic who will continue

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:43,219
from here thank you and hi everyone so

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:45,580
we'll start with so internals so in na

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:49,729
simulation is made of components

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:53,479
components base components sensors I

00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:58,719
played out the robot and all components

00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:02,000
in moss extending those classes and

00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:05,900
secondly linked to interface modifier

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,500
overlays and they are defined by

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:12,949
mandatory Python description the same

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:19,240
kind of trip we saw before and they

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:22,880
might come with 3d mesh so it is a

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,050
snapshot of our robots obviously you can

00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:30,080
extend it and add your own if you want

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:34,839
briefly the one we will see the more fun

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,579
in atl v4 all the outdoor field robotics

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,610
simulation and you have the pier to

00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:44,110
Almack's is a llamar

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:46,690
there and Zito which is last human robot

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:51,220
interaction robot for you man orbit in

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:54,610
direction and then the inner loop so we

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:58,810
have two interaction modalities data

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,000
stream and services well if you come

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:04,600
from Russ you all know the principles

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,230
and data stream publish biomass for

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,470
sensor and read five letters and we have

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:15,209
a strong the coping so mouse is not

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:18,760
aware of middle way until we link sensor

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:21,339
anakata in general component to a

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,660
specific middle way so we can even have

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,010
different middle were in the same

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:29,550
simulation and follow different robots

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:34,720
modifier I'll play as a sensor and

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:37,899
aequitas data so the same there is no

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,750
link I mean there is no communication

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:43,959
straight communication inside sensor to

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:50,680
modifier is made outside by dynamic link

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:55,019
and component local that I external

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:59,260
interface like circuit football or Ross

00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:03,390
and yeah services as you know can be

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:06,610
synchronous or asynchronous and

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,560
principal so for the interface we have

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:14,040
the basic socket and text that will work

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,890
everywhere and then we have different

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:22,800
middle were spotted so Ross obviously

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:27,699
and yup gentleman poker ribs are less

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:31,269
developed libraries open at him we just

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:34,959
learned few months ago that few people

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:37,959
in Japan just made a superb for open a

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,399
team in moss it's not yet merged in the

00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,380
industry but we might do it later and

00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:49,000
moose which is a widower develop that

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:52,120
book swap and

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,340
so for the mapping we used data stream

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,900
oriented RPC oriented as I said before

00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,970
and all the language biding are made in

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:06,300
Python and can be easily extended

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:09,400
through our language python binding and

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,500
so we can do what God simulation

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,870
introspection through so get in their

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,190
face we have simulation service running

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,610
in parallel of the simulations that

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,530
allow us to get the data from each and

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:29,530
every component in the simulation and

00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:32,380
control each and every component and all

00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:38,070
the solution and this realization is

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,070
made in each middle workplaces and

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,330
basically for the circuit which comes

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,570
with a basic installation of mouse is

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:53,160
Jason and you can find on the

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,490
documentation a full list of supported

00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:03,400
components and related neither were

00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:05,980
objects and messages for us and then you

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,370
can see what you saw Reggie's human

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:12,400
avatar will just add a few things that

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,100
there is connection to control it

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,710
through open an eye and use connect to

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,620
to control the human avatar and interact

00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,570
with the robot through simulation so it

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,410
has been done a few times already for

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:29,850
different presentation and we we have

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,850
also card everything is open source and

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,120
not going to talk about Milton odd so

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:40,360
this is a basic video where we see two

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,800
most instance running in parallel and in

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,480
background you have a meaty not server

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,160
so if we select the left instance and we

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,290
move on or button on the right essence

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,680
instance we move another one so at the

00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:00,080
moment the only exchange data as a robot

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:05,480
position and in the future we could

00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:08,660
add the giant forearms it's requested

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,620
features that we will develop soon or

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,170
later i guess and sofas women the idea

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,970
is to be able to distribute the

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:22,480
stimulation of robot on the front

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:25,610
computer for instance all the sensors is

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,850
taking quite a lot of cpu for instance

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,390
or the leaders and cameras and as soon

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:36,800
as you try to simulate mature what

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:44,140
scenario you up and quickly to get stuck

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:46,520
in cpu to to get limited by your cpu so

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,370
what you can do in mass is just

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,620
distribute the simulation of one robot

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:55,250
on one machine on one rod and another

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,980
one so that what is working at the

00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,350
moment we are doing a simulation of our

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:06,680
IT RV on one machine and simulation of

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:09,470
as mio max on another one and in the

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:13,160
future what we want to do is a bit more

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:18,260
complex still the same but more nodes so

00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:22,970
we still miss synchronization strong

00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:27,310
synchronization support but it's going

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,410
to come soon so still missing as I said

00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,900
so I didn't say that faster than a

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,560
real-time simulation is not yet foolish

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:43,220
parted next please eat time number of

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:47,570
event so we don't have tags on what's

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:50,270
happening in real time support for

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,920
logging and replay actually this can be

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:54,170
easily done because Belinda are always

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,810
to record everything or the movement of

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,980
each and every object in the scene since

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,870
Gavin join was developed inside render

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,190
for game and also for

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:09,300
simulation interaction in between object

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:13,560
so we can record what called through f

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:17,160
curves and arrow which RS to then

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,570
replace the old simulation at all and

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,880
everything stopped in that blend fight

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:26,699
full support appear to so far the moment

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:33,949
which were all the arms and sensors but

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:37,079
I guess what's missing is grippers and

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:40,500
so this is interesting feature to

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,510
develop and of course you name it it's

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,889
fully open source is BSG so you take it

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,600
to do whatever you want you want you

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,880
contribute and we will be happy to make

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:56,130
your patch and so speaking about

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:59,550
matching there would be a workshop six

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:03,839
and seven of June in Europe might be in

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:08,209
11 in Belgium this is to be confirmed we

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:12,050
expect around 30 people you're welcome

00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:14,639
so it will start with the tutorial and

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,930
then some discussion about design

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:23,130
meetings some meeting about discussion

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:27,149
for design and yeah i think that here

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,910
and began team and introduction with

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:32,430
most development so you can already

00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:36,690
register on the website not that open

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:39,300
robot at all and feel free to go there

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:47,310
and edit the wiki page related to this

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:49,699
event and that's it for my part thank

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,699
you and

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:07,070
love that one thank you questions or

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,070
either of our speakers yes right there

00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:26,940
it's also you speaking about the depth

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:44,010
sensor or a bit well Gabe of us can exit

00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:46,830
questioning ok the question is how much

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:50,880
dated we can generate in real time using

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:54,120
our depth sensor actually maybe if I can

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,370
unfound it when you yeah so to be to be

00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,430
honest we didn't benchmark completely

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,990
all the all the data from Vera dine we

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,000
have two version of Aerodyne we have one

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,850
using ray casting so this one is really

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
speak consuming we have another one

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,850
developed quite recently using the

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,460
z-buffer from OpenGL and this one can

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,930
give us a lot of that as the thing is we

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,350
need to serialize them and send them

00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:23,850
through either so Couture us and

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:30,200
actually this is the worst part at the

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:35,850
moment i would say we generated 60 640 x

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:38,760
480 z-buffer in real time on one orbit

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,860
in one simulation so this is one one

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,960
shot and then you need to turn your

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,120
camera to two as i said before on

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,600
and we didn't get much been tried this

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,600
yet

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:05,890
I let office it does of the simulation

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,620
of dynamics which I didn't matter i

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,600
myself it should be quite good and i

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,860
guess you would like to see a now robot

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,110
integrated so i heard several some

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,149
colleague of mine will actually work to

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:22,149
watch that so if you could drop your

00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:25,000
mail like in one month or I don't know a

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:28,090
time schedule but it is planned and it

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,870
is it should be possible also with

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,870
complex dynamics

00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:54,309
so the question is how to represent the

00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:57,099
interaction in multi not in between two

00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:59,499
instance of simulation at the moment as

00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:03,940
I said just before we just exchanged the

00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:05,769
position of robot and we specify we make

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,220
a link in between one robot and one

00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:11,830
specific node and on orgy of the node we

00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,379
just disable the physics simulation for

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,419
this specific robot and disabled or

00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,999
towards a sensor on this robot sensor

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:22,149
any patterns and then the multi not

00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:24,820
server will send the position of each

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:27,869
and every robot on every nodes and those

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:32,169
nodes will update the position of the

00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:36,450
non-local robots and so this allows

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:39,909
actually to have the interaction and to

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:43,440
remove all the robot from the physics

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:50,009
simulation so the interaction in between

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,009
two robots is just in between two nodes

00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:02,419
a key question is how hard it is to

00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:06,049
import models form for example Ross and

00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:08,539
blender it depends on how well you model

00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,700
it can be imported into blender blender

00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:14,809
does not explicitly support you are DF

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,460
but it does support colada files so then

00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,309
there is another in Rasta so you already

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,960
have to call a convergent I tried it

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,929
like two years ago I had some troubles

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,059
with it but you can basically convert

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,809
your your efl to colada and import those

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,399
into blender but there is also heaps of

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:33,919
importers and exporters for blender for

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:37,309
many other files you can also 3d studio

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,009
as no problem wavefront is one of the

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:42,129
ones I saw as a bit so there's heaps of

00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:45,649
files that are supported but you're AF

00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:54,169
itself not not directly yet but feel

00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:56,769
free to write imported thank you thank

00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,769
