welcome everybody so what I would like

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,179
to do is I would like to show you or

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,120
explain to you who is hosting this

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,670
conference first of all and then give

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,150
you an idea what IPA is doing in

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,460
robotics and then get into the history

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,420
also a little bit of open-source

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:28,439
development and then hand you over to

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,320
the real talks about Roscoe so found

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,770
offer on offer is called an offer

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,530
because there was a man he was a

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,010
researcher on the one side he found the

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,550
so-called Fraunhofer lines here which

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:46,530
now enable us to for example to detect

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,280
the type of material that you're looking

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,320
at he also was an inventor he invented

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,870
for example machining processes to do

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,969
better lenses and also he was an

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,010
entrepreneur he became pretty rich after

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,109
all of the his inventions so we thought

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,480
or the people in front of her thought

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:08,150
that that's that's a good role model for

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,290
us renova is one of the largest

00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,350
institutions for applied research in

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,110
Europe at least with more than 60

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,240
institutes more than 22,000 employees

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,280
and more than two billion euros in

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,920
budget the billions are American

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,229
billions not the German billions brown /

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,170
IPA is one of the large manufacturing

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,840
Institute's or the largest Institute in

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,710
the area of manufacturing we had a

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,470
budget of over 50 million euros in 2012

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,860
out of that were almost 20 million

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:47,490
coming from industry and we're having

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:54,509
almost 400 scientists and almost another

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:56,509
400 student scientific assistance we're

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,540
working in the area of automation

00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:03,299
robotics medical technology vision

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,450
system non-destructive testing and all

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,869
of that but also I have a colleague

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:12,630
who's focusing on the area of business

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:15,180
organization quality management

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,720
sustainable production and all sorts of

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:22,500
coatings even electroplating so we're

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,020
pretty we have a pretty wide range with

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,230
regards to manufacturing whatever is

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,230
possible to do automation with we do it

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,720
and in the area of robotics we have

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:39,180
around 100 people working in that area

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:42,360
and we're doing anything all the way

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,820
from conceptual design down to

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,810
specifications all the way to system

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:52,530
implementation mostly in industrial or

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:55,110
industry related projects we're not

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,030
developing a lot of new robots but we're

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:02,490
developing a lot of new applications

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:06,840
with robots or for robots and we do a

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:11,570
lot of special robots like the care

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:14,610
about which is also our most liked or

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:18,480
most interesting toy I would say also

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:21,330
with regards to rust but we also had for

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,790
example robots hosting robots for

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,380
museums which are running for 10 years

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,080
since several thousand kilometers

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,430
already we did for example offshore

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,830
service robots hydrogen fueling robots

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,690
climbing robots to the window cleaning

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:39,720
and lots of robots in the industrial

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:44,550
area also all the way from bin picking

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:50,970
to packaging to special applications in

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:55,410
the assembly area so what what do we do

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:58,470
with open source I would like to first

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,200
of all look at the history of open

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:04,230
source and how we view at it how we look

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,959
at it and then to give you some ideas

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,190
but what we were exactly doing on the

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,140
area of open source development so in

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,240
the 60s if you look at the history money

00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,570
was earned by really selling Hardware

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,819
rather than software and software was

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:24,430
only a minor portion of the rd

00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:26,740
and the source code came along with the

00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:32,319
machine you didn't have to pay for it at

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:39,160
that time in the 70s the first version

00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:42,280
of UNIX came around at AT&T and there

00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:46,810
was free access to universities but no

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,780
support no bug fixes at all and the

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,389
support started later on through the

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:57,669
University of Berkeley and the Usenet of

00:04:52,389 --> 00:05:02,620
UNIX in the 70s and 80s I think Bill

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:04,479
Gates can take credit for taking making

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:06,220
separate parts or separate business

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,740
cases on the software and the hardware

00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:11,380
business him focusing on the software

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,490
business software became more and more

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,289
complex and there was some refinancing

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,400
necessary so all these software

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:25,930
companies grew and managed to get paid

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,419
also in 84 Richard Stallman started the

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,500
new project and the Free Software

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:36,570
Foundation which was another important

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:41,020
milestone we think and also in the 90s

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:43,210
leanest watts started the Linux

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:48,039
development had merged it with the new

00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:51,759
project so there were some roots always

00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:55,199
up down to the 80s we think another

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,639
great step towards open source

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,080
applications was really the net

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:05,800
reduction of Netscape in 1998 open

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,990
source software became more important

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,509
got larger impact and there was more and

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:16,630
more applications to follow in that area

00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:19,780
and all of them spread faster and faster

00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:22,240
I think a lot of you use some of these

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:27,610
applications still like VLC and so on so

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,420
on and today I think open source is

00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,660
everywhere in consumer goods

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,060
in an automation for us as the

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,330
automation guys obviously automation is

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,620
the most interesting even in Germany we

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:47,370
have club called OS RDL which is another

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,540
club making NC controls and all the

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:53,670
interfaces that you need for NC controls

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,010
open sores and distributing it through

00:06:53,670 --> 00:07:01,070
my university institute with some

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:04,620
industry partners also so even the very

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:08,160
old economy mechanical engineering the

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,190
machine tool companies found that open

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,070
source is really a good idea to go in

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:18,480
the development of that area for example

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:22,310
there is lots of different applications

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,780
around there is lots of licensed models

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:29,520
lots of different business models around

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,920
and which one you tubes or whatever has

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,340
an impact on us we will see in the

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:40,830
future open source in robotics beyond

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:45,570
ross is the names that you can see here

00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:47,850
on this slide libraries for planning for

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,830
perception for kinematics and so on

00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,540
there's so many other things going on

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,910
and some point in time people always

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,950
need to find the right distinction

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,410
between what what is going to be open

00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,560
source and what is still proprietary

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:07,650
closed source but I think there is a lot

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:12,090
of nice business models on the way

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:16,170
already so with this looking back in in

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:19,440
history I would like to show you our

00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:22,740
motto which is it is always better to

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,140
stumble on new paths than getting stuck

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,060
on all roads and I think you do

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,090
something very similar to that you try

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,589
new ways of developing stuff you have

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,719
you do

00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:38,169
you even meet on weekends which is also

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,390
different from the regular and you meet

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:43,839
very early in the morning I hope you

00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:47,170
have a wonderful conference a lot of

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,750
good exchange in information new ideas

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,750
