okay hello everyone I am G only from

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:11,160
using robot today I'm going to tell you

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,780
about taught about to the new reference

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,850
platform for Ross how it is started and

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:24,779
what are the changes from taught about

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:27,420
one to talk about two so talk about one

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:32,969
was started from Willow Garage in 2011

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:36,329
it was great what many researchers and

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,760
hobbies like to use I like it and they

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:47,190
refused it or like with their own

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:52,199
purpose it was great they liked it

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,750
because a it is open source so they have

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,690
a lot of tools to play around and it was

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,940
easy to customize so they can modify

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,180
some stuff to like fit in your day or

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,049
their project and that or not another

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,760
key thing was it was cheap so they are

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:17,180
like individual researchers can afford

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:19,950
it to use for research however after

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:25,680
about a year it showed and start to show

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:28,020
a problem so it has some hardware

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,189
limitation coming from old technology

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,970
like the battery was too short and free

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:39,240
and ultimately was not the precise and

00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,369
also there was no active active

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:46,829
maintainer for a long time so the

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:49,079
software is not like stable and like up

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:53,329
to date for the next release for Ross

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,729
and also there is no github at the boom

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:59,490
github was not that popular at that time

00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,920
so y which means it was hard to get a

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,100
user contribution and how to receive the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,770
bug fixes and patches from user and the

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,500
biggest problem was the distribution of

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,170
thought about one thought about one was

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,980
built on top of

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:19,160
irobot create however the irobot create

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:23,780
was available only limited region like

00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,540
North America so in Europe they had to

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,140
build their own thought about using

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:32,840
rumba in Korea using robot also wanted

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,840
to discrete the potty bot but we

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,920
couldn't buy iRobot create and we

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,580
couldn't use room by as well because

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,800
Eugene Eugene is a Korean company also

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,110
produces clean cleaning robot in Korea

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,180
so we can it could have been really

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:56,480
funny that like we sell taught about

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:58,819
with rumba so we found out we we solve

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,549
these issues and we have saw some

00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:05,120
potentials intolerable so we decide to

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:07,970
start these eggs become the start of

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,950
powdered talk about to project to call

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,900
it and use all I take all the advantages

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:15,140
of the taught about one which was good

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:18,140
low coast and easy customization and

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:23,359
open source and remove all the issues

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:30,380
that talk about 1 hat so this is the

00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:32,090
result so what are the changes in

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,920
improvements in thought from total but

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,000
want to talk about to there are three

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,430
major changes so as you saw now it is

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,459
using new mobile base I Clabo kabuki

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,980
from using robot and software get

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:56,209
maintained and by great book to github

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:58,459
and the community got larger when I was

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,840
at school including when I was at school

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:06,530
before joining using I had to for my

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:10,069
research I had to build like 24 7

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:13,040
operator bore experiment house with

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:17,389
taught about one which just I can access

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,120
for 24 7 however I had a lot of problems

00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:23,720
to make it happen and I had to use a lot

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,550
at tweeks to get it working the reason

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,550
was the robot

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,550
was has a tube and has a two short

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,000
battery so you thought it was dying like

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,210
a to Africa after two hours and the

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,120
driver get was shut down when you it

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:45,500
when it goes into the docking station

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,150
and so I had to restart the driver every

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:53,030
time he goes the chart goes the charge

00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:55,669
mode and uh the big issue was i had to

00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,520
recharge the netbook every time manually

00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:02,139
because there was no way to charge the

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,930
netbook without without from the robot

00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:08,060
after joining Eugene I I talked to my

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,710
team and team members about like my

00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,500
experience about taught about one and

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,440
what was bad when I was good from

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,590
pottery but and my support budget

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,719
Danielle told me that so you know what

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,479
so all the issues that you haven't

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,400
thought about one what is already solved

00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:31,430
in total I with the new base coupe

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:36,139
kabuki okay stay calm so you didn't when

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:40,069
Eugene starts to design the new mobile

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,529
base I Clabo kabuki they actually cut

00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:45,909
got the feedback from the youth and

00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:49,330
thought about users and had a lot and

00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:52,190
collaborated work with their partners to

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,050
solve all the issues and put to

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:57,469
integrate all the interesting features

00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:02,090
into into the robot so this is the

00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:04,789
result now it has a like much longer

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:09,020
battery compared to the old I previous

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:11,779
robot so with the default better battery

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,669
a code three hours and with the larger

00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,300
one it goes more than seven hours which

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,669
allows like full day operation and it

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,840
now it provides a precise ultimately

00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:27,039
using built in gyro sensor and robot is

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,960
designed to be really flexible it is

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,419
providing multiple power source on from

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,900
the robot so it you can add like

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,410
audition audition sensors and actually

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:43,120
really pal easily and another good thing

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:46,660
was now robot can serve the power to the

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,130
netbook it does not mean it shares the

00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,080
battery with the netbook and the robot

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:56,169
and the robot but when robot goes in the

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,840
charge mode is start to send up the

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,900
power to the netbook from from there I

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:07,930
did using the 9-volt and 2 ampere the

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:10,870
power source so with so actually it was

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,360
alright so you with the new toy robot it

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,289
solve all my issues that I have for my

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:23,979
reason for from for that I had in school

00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:26,169
research so robot is cut down this is

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,110
some examples of the customer robot

00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:32,860
customization using boogie so on top

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:38,080
left is raspberry pi on top of kabuki

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:42,220
and got integrate with the XM pro 11 PhD

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,710
student from University Kyushu in his in

00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:49,539
kabuki community and sent us this

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:52,990
picture and on the top right is we put

00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:55,680
we put the array of iron on top of robot

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,440
to maximize the obstacle avoidance for

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,340
navigation which was green I was working

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,599
pretty well and we got the audrina

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:14,440
working and embedded on board on top and

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:17,740
also as you know thought about to there

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,800
are so did a new mobile base was one of

00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,020
the major change but also software has

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:30,460
path is improved a lot too so the

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:33,219
software is now in github and it has

00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,010
active may I like multiple active

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:40,510
maintainer so it is now ready for the

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:42,830
user contribution and and all the source

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:48,440
code all the sources are

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:51,050
are stable and up-to-date and also ross

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,450
wiki documentation is updated so

00:08:51,050 --> 00:09:02,600
everything is ready for research or the

00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:05,260
users and we also rebuilt all under an

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,690
android framework for thought about to

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:10,820
the previous version was using the like

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:15,140
fixed and give old fixed version of rose

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:18,410
java so on in this year january we went

00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,830
to OS RF and we'd we upgraded all I

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,260
rebuilt all the android framework I'm

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,150
android framework for total bought with

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,090
the up-to-date version Ross Java so it

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:33,250
is more a lot more stable and got

00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:35,600
improved and all the all talked about

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,340
applications are now registered in

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,900
Google Play so you can tap out you can

00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:46,070
download and use it right away like

00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:55,660
Andrew Italia and slam navigation or my

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:55,660
favorite thought about follower 20 also

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,730
Cordoba I so is getting ready and with

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,980
for the out of box experience and for

00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:10,070
the begin a beginner to Ross or being

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,590
there to how to beginner to rope em talk

00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:16,250
about thanks to bill for huge amount of

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:23,570
work too I of handling all the stuff for

00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:26,930
iso creation and community has been

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:29,690
changed to has been like reshaped now so

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,980
as taught about when starting from the

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:37,550
below but now its new nest is osr it is

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,220
moved it has moved 20 srf now and also

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:45,970
using robot we using robot also joined

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:48,530
as a member of community too and also

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,840
we're looking for on up for another new

00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:52,970
players in town about talk about

00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:55,379
community for thought about equity or

00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:06,220
the better ecosystem and for

00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:10,420
more forever to use these are these are

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,970
our the disputes in the world and for at

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,810
talk about to distributors Robotnik in

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:20,379
Spain and guy take in China and using

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:23,319
robot in Korea and RT cooperation in

00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,810
Japan and clear path and I her

00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:27,970
engineering in North America so you

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,120
can't buy taught about almost everywhere

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:45,699
in the world also more distributors will

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:50,639
join soon too so oh it's duplicated in

00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:55,360
the feet in we're actively developing on

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:58,509
the taught about this software now we

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,750
are since groovy was really bumpy and it

00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:04,600
was hard to like keep it stable so we

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,170
decided to put all our new features into

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,540
hidro so now we are actively working on

00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,899
redesigning the android app framework to

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,290
be more flexible and to be more better

00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:21,519
than to be more stable so people can

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:26,410
start to create their custom application
