I'm Eric if you want to meet me we can

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,000
do that downstairs robot evolution you

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,280
know there were a hundred and ten

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,330
thousand robots industrial robots sold

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,550
last year okay all of them met these

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:19,770
qualities every single one of them there

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,859
was a medium to large lot size on the

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,840
ROI or you couldn't make the ROI the

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,330
number of tasks that the robot was going

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,609
to do in its lifetime were few it just

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,500
did them over and over again somebody

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,100
with some skill had to go teach that

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,160
robot the robot was fenced away from the

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,260
people and typically the robot was

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,820
anchored to the floor and if we got

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,829
fancy it slid back and forth okay and

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,020
that doesn't matter what color robot it

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,570
is or what the configuration was whether

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,820
it was a delta or a 15 dolphin

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,800
manipulator or a standard six axis

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,690
machine these were the essential

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,390
qualities for a production robot what we

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,640
really need is a production partner okay

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,470
if robotics is going to meet the promise

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,590
of you know delivering man from drudgery

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:15,869
and we're going to do it in places other

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:19,430
than automotive OEMs then this is what

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,900
you need you have to have it achievable

00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:26,640
commercially speaking with a small lot

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:28,530
size hi mix low volume what that means

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,900
is you got to think of your tasks you're

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,009
one off task as the standard not the

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:37,619
exception which means that the burden of

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,710
the programming effort to the runtime

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,700
has got to be turned around right now

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,149
the programming is difficult so we have

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:51,630
to have automatically generated paths

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,369
trajectories robot programs or direct

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,810
teaching methods just grab the robot

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:00,979
move it where you need it to go as you

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,020
start moving towards the other parts of

00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:07,049
manufacturing where there are people

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,310
then you have to have interaction be

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,580
frequent so you're going to have to have

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,500
the collaborative shared space and then

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:18,280
the robot needs to be

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:23,560
freely deployable right the point is on

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:29,290
the left is production machinery on the

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:33,850
right is labor and insofar as we are

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:37,870
able to emulate labor the robot industry

00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:40,209
will be successful that's why the robot

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,910
industry is excited about the things

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,680
that we think has been doing not because

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,530
we view them as a competitor but because

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:52,989
they drive us towards the technologies

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:56,080
for production partners so when I looked

00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:58,209
at these gaps how come I don't have

00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,480
these now where is all of this

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:03,190
technology and I you know swept through

00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,989
the United States and Canada and Mexico

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,090
looking at all of the research work

00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,070
happening in robotics to help me fill

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:13,840
these gaps so that I can better address

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:20,709
my market what I found as a common theme

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:23,829
is everyone was using Ross okay I'm not

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:29,010
an academic the truth is I care very

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:32,079
little about Ross but I do care about

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,400
development of technology that moves my

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:40,120
business forward so you didn't have to

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,480
hit me twice when I saw Ross everywhere

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,850
I said I should make sure that the Ross

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,940
community knows they can talk to my

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,610
equipment so in conjunction with sweary

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,329
we developed an early version of a

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,160
driver for our robots we did it for our

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:01,090
seventh off machine you saw it probably

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,680
in his video it supports sixth off

00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,470
machines it's going to soon be

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:10,090
supporting the dual arm the latest

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,730
generation of that Ross interface runs

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,670
at full speed the robot ustream points

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:19,120
there are you rdf models and this is

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:23,500
significant it is OEM supported we did

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,380
it okay this is significant because our

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,200
customers care about that

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:32,260
what we can't have and this was made

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:36,010
very explicit to us at the consortium

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,350
meeting is I'm sorry it doesn't matter

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:43,450
to me that there is a driver for robot

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:46,390
why if that driver breaks I need to be

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:49,990
able to contact robot manufacturer why

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,690
and say you better fix this we can't

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:57,240
have it be it was done by a grad student

00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:02,140
we don't know where he is anymore okay

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,240
OEM support was required not because we

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,650
want to but because our market demands

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,520
it alright so to us the value in Ross is

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,180
not again about the software it's about

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,710
the applications that it enables us to

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:24,490
address so in this early version this is

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:28,480
a seventh off on a on the wheel platform

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,790
and it is simulating d painting of an

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,440
airfoil of a path it has never been

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:37,900
taught and it's achieving it to within

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,730
very tight tolerances because it's also

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,080
integrated to the external metrology

00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:47,830
system this would have been a

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,670
non-starter with any industrial robot

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:55,870
system the only way that this was

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:59,560
possible was through Ross it's the

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:03,520
application that it makes viable that's

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:07,560
important to us so what do I hear when I

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:11,620
talk to my colleagues about Ross I

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,260
already know how to do that okay i don't

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,790
i don't need Ross that means you don't

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,980
have any idea what Ross is doing okay

00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,200
because when you first talked to us as

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,640
when you first engage us as robot

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,290
manufacturers and you start talking

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,710
about interfaces we think you're wanting

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,650
to step on our ik and our dynamics model

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,320
in our servo control we know how to do

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:39,990
that and we can do that better than you

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,990
all right we have 30 years of doing that

00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:45,060
but that's not what the Ross community

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,980
is offering this is a misunderstanding

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:53,330
between us and you Ross adds little

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:56,130
value to process robots this is actually

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,730
important right the majority of

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:01,830
industrial robots old paint spot welding

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,290
arc welding as all of this process

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,710
expertise out there and Ross doesn't

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:12,000
address that that's also a bit of a

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:15,990
fallacy it's true that Ross purports to

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,740
have no ability to slope analog values

00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,470
for you know paint fan spray there's no

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,760
interest in you doing that right so

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,990
that's Court the software is not going

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,320
to support that on the other hand

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,330
there's lots of activities around that

00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,250
paint process that Ross does address in

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,850
trajectory generation collision

00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,910
avoidance and these other things but I

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:42,390
do want to talk about this a minute

00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,760
George Devol right the seminal patent in

00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:48,060
the industrial robot industry the

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:52,550
programmed article transfer him and Joe

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:56,910
angle burger right nineteen sixty one

00:07:52,550 --> 00:08:01,820
fifty years later everybody's first

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:04,560
robot is still a pick and place machine

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,680
right it doesn't matter if it's a lego

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,800
mindstorm or the pr2 everybody starts

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,160
out picking and placing hardware moving

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,350
components around that's fine there's a

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,410
lot of it to be done and certainly Ross

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,350
has a lot of tools that make this more

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:26,730
viable so I don't want to discount that

00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:30,240
on the other hand back to that all of

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:33,000
these robots doing process work we've

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,790
got to think beyond material handling

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,729
and that's really my challenge to this

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:40,710
group is think in terms of all the

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:44,760
things the robots could do as we move

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,840
beyond poses beyond pick and place and

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:51,120
to intelligent trajectory planning

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,620
that's why this curious silly-looking

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,210
demo downstairs

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,610
this is so compelling to me right

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:02,460
because this is an example of Ross being

00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:07,260
used to address a real problem in

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:10,730
industry nobody but nobody likes to hold

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:15,900
a grinder all day and deburr components

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:18,360
but it happens everywhere why hasn't

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,790
robotics been applied to it before you

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,730
can't have a you know die grinder on the

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,279
end of a manipulator sure you could it's

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,779
back to the question of programming

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:34,610
versus runtime right and yet we were

00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:39,660
able to exploit Ross tools to do

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:43,830
effectively a cam operation go into the

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:47,279
CAD file extract away the the joints

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:49,440
parameterize them recognize that we have

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,880
so many degrees of freedom available to

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,300
us optimized to that and voila

00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:01,560
automatically generated viable robot

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,959
program and completely abstracted take

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,420
away this blue robot and put in an

00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,709
orange robot take away the arms robot

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,980
and put in a seven degree of freedom

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:16,110
machine it doesn't matter Ross just did

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,390
that for you beyond pic in place all

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,120
right the other 1i here I'm not a

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,709
startup I don't need open source

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,160
software going to reduce my cause what

00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:33,560
do we just say the value of Ross is not

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:38,910
in the cost it's in the applications and

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:41,010
then this one it's unreliable it's

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,459
unacceptable risk because it's open

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:49,560
source and we have to serve a market

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:52,470
with very high demands this is true the

00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:57,240
market the bar for industrial automation

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,430
equipment is very high right our

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,380
customers are not going to accept

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:06,260
regularly open source software so I say

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,300
to them hey you know what

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:14,279
the truth is you're ignoring how the IT

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:16,260
world works and we have ross industrial

00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,240
that's trying to mitigate this risk by

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,100
going to a stable version of ross from

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,060
which we can all work and harden but i

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,649
have to tell you that doesn't always

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:33,180
that's not sufficient to convince a lot

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:36,959
of the end users okay the fact is you're

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:40,920
not going to deploy anything that's open

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:45,680
source at boeing they were very plain

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:52,470
with me on this you know to which I say

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:55,110
don't worry about it okay on the left is

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:57,480
my 3d printer at the shop on the right

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,260
is my vertical machining center at the

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,250
same shop bought the 3d printer two

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,770
years ago use it all the time why

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,070
because it allows me to very readily do

00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,810
a prototype do proof of principle on

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:17,240
whatever little mechanism it is that's

00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:20,510
of interest to me allows me to quickly

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:25,350
validate and iterate on a design and

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:28,730
then once i'm done with that cycle you

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:32,160
know what i do i send it to the milk and

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:38,520
I make it out of machined aluminum right

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:42,200
i hardened the prototype i would offer

00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,010
to you that Ross is the 3d prototype ER

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:49,579
of robot software there are lots of

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:52,110
instances where we're going to take loss

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:54,000
we're going to iterate on it we're going

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:57,959
to get the functionality that we need

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,279
and then we're going to take and harden

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:06,720
it but the reason I made the prototype

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:09,899
on here and not here is because that is

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,570
a production piece of equipment every

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:18,089
time that is running it better be for a

00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:20,810
production sellable part the same is

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,930
true with my software development

00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:27,630
the same is true with my resource the

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,910
number of people worldwide that know the

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,829
in-form language to the ability that

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,959
they can create new functionality within

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:39,269
my robot controller that's a very small

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:42,269
group that is a resource I need to

00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:46,079
optimize and the way that I do that is

00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:52,220
by front ending the prototyping work in

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:57,569
Los but in the end it gets hardened and

00:13:52,220 --> 00:14:01,190
we run it on vxworks and then we can go

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:04,889
back to our user and say it's all right

00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:11,250
there is no open source software running

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:13,649
on your floor ok and there's little that

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,110
Ross offers that impacts the robots we

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,149
sell today ok in the end if they can't

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,930
you know get you with the other ones

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,449
they'll say well you know it just

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:25,290
doesn't matter it doesn't impact what

00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:29,250
we're doing and it is a numbers game I'm

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:30,810
from a dot-com okay but if your business

00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,839
plan can be met with today's

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:37,170
applications all right but here's the

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,060
reality people there were a hundred and

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,589
seven thousand robots shipped last year

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,589
look how many of them went to automotive

00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:51,439
64,000 this is sixty percent of the

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:55,170
industrial hardware went to a customer

00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:57,750
that's a bad situation okay we're

00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,399
frankly in this industry not very far

00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,009
removed from being just another

00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:04,620
automotive component supplier you could

00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:08,730
be providing steering wheels valve stems

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:12,689
robots seats it's all the same from a

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:17,160
business model perspective we don't like

00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:20,310
that second number secondly 107,000

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,130
numbers pretty small when you think

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:26,130
about it you see the robot industries

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:29,610
never been important enough to drive our

00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,250
own technology we're just too small so

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,920
we really rely on the advances in

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:37,820
consumer electronics

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,820
in you know I tea and such that are

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,089
really going to be adaptable to our

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:48,740
industry that's not going to change even

00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:52,970
if that number quadrupled we rely we

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:56,269
ride the coattails of others the other

00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:59,360
thing that you should know is 64,000 all

00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:02,810
have been twice that it should have been

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,800
twice that why isn't it well how do I

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,660
know it should have been twice that

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,149
because for every robot that I see in

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,130
the body and white area every spot

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:13,160
welding every painting every material

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:17,170
handling robot in the press room there

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:21,769
is a person on the final assembly line

00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:26,269
putting in the seats routing the wiring

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:31,399
harnesses all of that manual labor same

00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:35,329
factory same volume same roi argument

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:40,130
why aren't the robots there because we

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:44,240
were missing these pieces right I expect

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:48,380
that number will grow as a result of the

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,670
work that's done by this community but

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,769
the sixty percent problem that's the one

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,199
that bothers us I would be much more

00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:01,519
comfortable if we were at forty percent

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:04,490
reliance on any one industry this heavy

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:09,110
dependence on the transportation sector

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:12,949
is a risk right what it means is the

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:15,439
number one metric the most important

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:20,209
number in the robot industry at least in

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:23,209
North America is not the accuracy or

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,730
repeatability of your robot it is not at

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,100
how many Hertz can you stream points to

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,160
the robot that's not it the most

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:35,990
important number in robotics is 14

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:39,169
million because 14 million is the

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:43,159
threshold of the Tsar for us the

00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:45,020
seasonally adjusted annual rate it's the

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,539
number of automobiles sold in North

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,769
America

00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:52,859
on a year when that number is 14 million

00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:56,609
in higher all the robot guys are fat

00:17:52,859 --> 00:18:00,769
dumb and happy that number drops below

00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:08,940
14 million and we're sending people home

00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:11,070
okay that's a problem so what's the

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,009
business case we recognize that this

00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:17,690
dependence on automotive is a business

00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:21,659
risk we can't count on a 14 million

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:24,830
units are every year we've seen what

00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:27,779
happens when it drops below that number

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,729
so what's the mitigation strategy from a

00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:35,070
business perspective what do I have to

00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:37,830
do I must diversify the markets and in

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,340
our business which is the business of

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:45,419
the replication of labor the way I do

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:49,729
that is by go find the people find the

00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,830
labor put the robots there so logistics

00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:59,039
consumer electronics clinical medical

00:18:52,830 --> 00:19:01,489
etc so why are we there already because

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,879
new markets require new functions and

00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:10,349
I'm not in a position to develop them

00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:15,929
why because my group my resources are

00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:20,659
tied ok I have to manage my business all

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:24,239
right so what's the value of Ross to me

00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:27,149
there is no value it's the applications

00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:28,950
it enables that's the value all the

00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:31,499
interesting peripherals all the

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,090
algorithms all of the Patrick you're

00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:36,960
going to develop it in Ross before I

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:40,399
develop it in my proprietary system so

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,739
if I have a good clean well documented

00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:47,309
interface to Ross I get the benefit of

00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:50,759
your work early it's a time to market

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:53,159
strategy you have a whole community

00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:56,609
that's not encumbered by maintaining my

00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,139
existing business Sean was right if I

00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,890
would have called a meeting of informed

00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:00,810
programmers to

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,230
up on a Sunday I'd have been here by

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:06,240
myself and yet there's enough excitement

00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,700
in this community to do that Ross

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,430
industrial this effort is important to

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:16,020
me because we have to have a hardened

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:17,490
version to work from and finally this is

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,370
where I come when I'm looking for people

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:23,430
the industrial robot market you're the

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,260
type of thinkers we need so to me Ross

00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,400
Khan is as much a job fair as anything

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:32,550
else so if like us your interest is in

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,360
using robots to make stuff then you can

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,360
