00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:25,650
okay since we're meeting on a sunday i

00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:28,500

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,630
again to our sponsors because without

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,520
our generous sponsors we couldn't have

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,899
this event at all and we especially

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,460
couldn't do things like we did last

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,940
night so thank you very much to our

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,940
sponsors

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,690
and if you'll indulge me I'd like to say

00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,640
an overflow list from yesterday that

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,930
seated the list for today but there

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,100

00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,900
that they're still open slots you need

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,480
to find Ryan Gariepy standing right

00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,730

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,350
blazer on find him by the end of the

00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,750

you're taking advantage of this it's a

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,230
really great opportunity to get together

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:14,750
with other folks who have common

00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:16,400
interests and there are sign-up sheets

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,470

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,840
there'll be a meeting which you should

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,370

getting people together after the

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,180
conference tonight to talk about

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,500
embedded systems so kind of birds of a

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,500
feather session that'll happen off-site

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,709
the program for today is the same

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,930
structure as yesterday we're going to do

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,430
long talks in the morning in here and

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,860
then we're going to break for lunch and

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,200
then we're going to go double track in

00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,730
the afternoon the shorter talks happen

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:07,190
here having the other auditorium and

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:09,560
then finally one thing as floor I

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,780
mentioned yesterday we did because so

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,810
many people came we ran

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,810
out of t-shirts and glasses and bags so

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:19,569
if you didn't get yours you should send

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,100
us email at this address and include

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,900
your t-shirt size and your shipping

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,300
address and we'll do what we can to get

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,950
that to you I will do another run and do

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,280
our best to send it to you and then the

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:32,290
other question indicated by the map is

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,110
if you have an opinion on where we

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,790
should do this next year let us know so

00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,500
I think you know obviously we had a

00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,330
great turnout this year so we're almost

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,890
certainly going to do it again and the

00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,300
question is where do we do it for the

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,519
last four this year in last year we

00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,880
followed a Kura it connectors in Hong

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,500
Kong that's one possibility I Ross next

00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,590
year is in Chicago that's another

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,209
possibility there's also the option of

00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,430
doing it as a standalone event and just

00:03:55,209 --> 00:04:01,480
picking a location like say Hawaii to

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,060
pick a random one so if you have an

00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,620
opinion on this I'm sure you all have an

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,470
opinion if you have a suggestion just

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,959
let us know we want to do this where we

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,200
can get the the largest best group of

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,940
people so if you have a you know feeling

00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,440
on where we should do it whether or not

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,359
it should be attached to an existing

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,750
conference like we've been doing or just

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,650
on its own please please do let us know

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,650
