right good morning everybody it is early

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,379
on a Sunday morning where we thought

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,630
it'd be good to get started have you had

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,070
a good day yesterday and a good night it

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,840
looks like we've slightly thinned out so

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,509
maybe it was a good night

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,660
we got an action-packed day for you with

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,699
some longer talks a similar sort of flow

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,279
as yesterday some longer technical talks

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,769
in the morning and then some stuff in

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,750
the afternoon about some sort of

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,519
logistics of code quality and the wiki

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,519
followed by some other application areas

00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,440
before we head on to our keynote I just

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,700
had a few kind of logistics for you the

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,960
the the breaks are going to be pretty

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,980
much the same as before lunch provided

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,670
coffee and so on take a look at the

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,020
birds of a feather board next door I

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:56,070

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,469

00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,940

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,890

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,290
