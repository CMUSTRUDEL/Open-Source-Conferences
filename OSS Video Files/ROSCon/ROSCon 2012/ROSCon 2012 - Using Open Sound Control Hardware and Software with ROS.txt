okay for our last presentation we've got

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,390
Mike Carroll talking about using open

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,130
sound control hardware and software in

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,929
Ross I think specifically with the Apple

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,849
devices and you're going to want to

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,590
stick around just just for after this

00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,150
presentation it's a little bit longer we

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:23,519
do we do have another announcement

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,960
they're raffling off a PR to write so

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,269
like you said my name is michael carroll

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,590
and i have to have to thank Ryan and

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:30,269
Matt for letting me drive the Husky

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,590
around earlier with the iphone so that's

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,140
about that's what I'm about to show you

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,969
here so it is somewhat safe we almost

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,460
went turtle but bowling there for a

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:42,840
second but it all it all came out all

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,070
right so I'm with Auburn University I'm

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,140
a grad student electrical engineering

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,610
there to contact information I think all

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,190
this stuff is hosted on my website you

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,840
can take a look at it there so for the

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,430
sake of time I'm going to sort of avoid

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,930
hardware demonstrations you can meet up

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,520
with me after the presentation and we

00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,020
can we can look at all this stuff and

00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,850
there's also YouTube videos and it's all

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,500
fully documented on the wiki so I get a

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,719
gold star for Melanie wherever she went

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,820
so you can check check all that out on

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,890
the Ross org wiki so the first thing

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,900
everybody asked me is what what is the

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,850
sound open sound control what does it

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,860
have to do with Ross so open sound

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,750
control is actually a protocol developed

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,720
by UC Berkeley it's a very very very

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,720
thin protocol it's a sort of design as a

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,850
spiritual successor to midi in fact it

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,520
can sort of encapsulate all of the midi

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,439
specification inside of it so for those

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,119
of you who aren't familiar midi is the I

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,450
think musical instrument data

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,820
interchange format I they came up with

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,650
it I think in the mid 80s and it hasn't

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,369
evolved at all since then so I think

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,710
it's I think it's got like 16 bit

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:45,509
numbers integers for representing music

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,850
and things like that so it's intended

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,899
for sharing musical performance data so

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,899
gestures note sequences these sort of

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,600
things so the protocol kind of looks

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,579
like this its transport independent it's

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,590
kind of got your unix name spacing that

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,020
we're kind of familiar with seeing using

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,060
a whole bunch of ross the transport

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,099
independent means it can go over tcp UDP

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,790
i know a lot of people are sending it

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:14,640
over the wire doing things like arduino

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:19,140
or in as a replacement for DMX so over

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,760
like rs-422 and rs-485 so it's it's

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,129
really just kind of a cool simple little

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,299
protocol that's sort of fun to use one

00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:26,459
of the other things that it has it has

00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:28,290
support for bundles of messages so these

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,890
are kind of if you think of it as a Ross

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,090
message things that are meant to be

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:35,790
executed simultaneously which you could

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,780
imagine is fairly important in musical

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,189
performances so why use OSC why is this

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,920
interesting why is it interesting to us

00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:45,810
as robotics researchers so it's kind of

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,120
gained a lot of traction in the musical

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,970
community for these kind of novel

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,299
gesture multi-touch tangible interfaces

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,459
so two of the big ones there are tu i/o

00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,349
which is what this kind of is down here

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,450
on the bottom right it's the that's the

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:03,239
react table that's on the list of things

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,329
to buy with my first paycheck i think so

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,480
that's a super huge microsoft surface

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:11,400
knockoff it's all open source but all of

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,500
its data is actually encapsulated in

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,609
this OSC format so what they're doing

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,260
there I think this is actually a

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:19,169
synthesizer where they're dropping

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,019
different modules on to control how

00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,400
music is synthesized this is the monome

00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:24,810
which i think if you've been on the

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,870
internet for any length of time you've

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:30,359
probably seen big square tons of push

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,879
buttons I think several several

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:33,720
musicians use that in concert but

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,079
there's a lot of people out there

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,069
building these these kind of hardware

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:43,049
hardware interfaces that use OSC sort of

00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,790
how I found out about it and how I got

00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:49,949
interested in it is touch OSC which is

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,989
this ipod and ipad application and it

00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,220
allows you to create these virtual kind

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,139
of control panels so you can put

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,419
together knobs and sliders and buttons

00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:59,579
and all sorts of fun things like that

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,579
into any sort of layout that you want to

00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:05,159
make so some of the kind of interesting

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,750
parts of it uses Bonjour and 0 comp for

00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,669
all of its configuration so that's how

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,680
it finds other computers I know there's

00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:13,889
kind of been a lot of rumblings of using

00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,009
zeroconf or avahi or depending whatever

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,570
platform you use in Ross it's it's very

00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,060
very cool because you don't have to have

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,030
dhcp everything just sort of resolves

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,070
magically using just hardware addresses

00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,110
it supports custom control layouts you

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,510
load them right over to your iPad or

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,820
your iPod and you can start using them

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,070
right away it's actually created by our

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,320
j fisher who calls himself X Larry I

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,790
believe so this is corn sort of an

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,600
example layout gives you an idea of all

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,600
the different controls that are

00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,380
available you have XY pads labels multi

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,639
toggle multi-touch faders and rotary

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,860
knobs you can have up to 25 of these

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,050
Layout tab pages in a single layout so

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,940
there's a little tab bar at the top it's

00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:01,690
kind of faint in the in the projector

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:05,680
here but you can have up to 25 different

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,480
kind of views of the same system so when

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,190
I saw this I kind of got to thinking you

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,470
know I want to use it for robotics

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,840
because it's totally awesome to drive

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,640
robots with iPads and it makes our

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,130
advisors really really happy and project

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,630
sponsors really really happy so just

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,310
sort of to give you an idea it's sort of

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,760
the same things that we discussed in the

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,530
in the field robotics thing yesterday

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,450
you know a lot of times we have these

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,970
use cases for robots that I think Ross

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,440
might be a little a little generally

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:37,360
weak on but but we need as doing field

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,490
robotics so users want to be able to

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,800
easily move their robots around that's a

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,970
that's a big one so I don't know how

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,410
many of you've done a lot of work with

00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,840
the Department of Defense but it seems

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,510
like their minimum ocu size is about the

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,250
size of a suitcase which doesn't really

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,140
make a whole lot of sense considering

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,490
you know we carry around these things in

00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,590
our pockets that are just about as

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,110
powerful it's the penny amends or

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,150
whatever that we're shipping out for

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,320
defense projects and so I want to be

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,760
able to walk into the lab I want to be

00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,110
able to turn this robot on I want to

00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,910
drive it out the door and I want to get

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,070
to where I want to go and collect my

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,700
data without doing an immense amount of

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,360
console work or anything like that

00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,100
additionally I want to be able to

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,570
monitor hardware diagnostic information

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,010
and I want to be able to do it right

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,050
there on the spot and there's a lot of

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,520
tools built into ross we've heard about

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,979
how all of us should be using

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,450
diagnostics and our hardware drivers

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:30,300
which we do I don't know so I get a gold

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:32,800
star from Chad two gold stars all around

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,840
so you know I want to be able to monitor

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,150
voltages a critical one with the lawn

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,409
mower in Alabama is temperatures you

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,889
know currents also

00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:44,139
GPS satellites IMU calibration status

00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,429
all these things like that additionally

00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,719
i want my manager to be able to come in

00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:49,179
and figure out what's going on very very

00:06:46,719 --> 00:06:51,159
very quickly which is which is good in

00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:52,659
my case my advisor you know he wants to

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,149
be able to come in and say you know what

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:57,789
is it doing and i want to be able to go

00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:59,919
here hold the iphone stand over here you

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:04,539
can see it this is going on youtube

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,219
right so sorry dr. notes and then

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,919
additionally teams want to work on the

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,659
same robot without interfering so in my

00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,269
case you know i might be interested more

00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:14,860
in electrical hardware and williams more

00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:17,050
interested in what the software is doing

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,629
and it's kind of hard to figure all that

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,800
out while huddled over the same computer

00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,099
in the shack in the middle of the field

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,349
in alabama so kind of my solution is

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,479
rosso SC so this gives you the ability

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,869
to interact with both hardware and

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:36,219
software open sound control devices so

00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:38,439
the monome the reactivision or touch OSC

00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,399
it's a stack that consists of a couple

00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,929
different packages I'm going to run

00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,569
through them real quick so you can get

00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:45,639
an idea of what each of them do PI

00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:47,169
touchosc is basically just a ross

00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,179
independent python library for

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,439
interacting with this touchosc layout

00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:52,659
file so it allows you to kind of

00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:54,759
construct and manipulate these layout

00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:58,209
files that you want to load to the touch

00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:00,639
OSC device comes with a couple command

00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:02,709
line tools it's pretty easy to use it

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,229
also gives you the ability to load the

00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:06,939
layouts onto the device programmatically

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,369
through a Ross node which is a lot more

00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:13,389
helpful than the Java editor that it

00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:15,219
originally comes with so the very very

00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,869
basic part of the communication is this

00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:18,429
osc bridge this is what you would want

00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:21,039
to fire up if you want to interact with

00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:24,069
OSC hardware this works with both tcp

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,599
and UDP I tested it with a wiimote I

00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,599
know there's already a wiimote node in

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,069
Ross but that was the only only OSC

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,800
hardware that I have available I gladly

00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:36,189
take hardware donations I can get you my

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,709
address after the talk so basically all

00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:41,019
this does is it does the basic cross

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:42,490
strapping between the Ross protocols and

00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,350
the OSC protocols and make sure

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,019
everything starts up and shuts down the

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,269
way it's supposed to and it also does

00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:51,130
all of its bonjour registration which I

00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,950
recently found out somebody has already

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,010
done in

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:59,180
Ross so I might have to switch over to

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:02,690
that so when you fire up your iPhone if

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,460
you're using say touchosc the bonjour

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,580
allows it to just show up in a list you

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,860
click and everything auto configure ate

00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,600
itself auto configures itself picks out

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,070
hostname port everything you don't have

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,920
to remember any of that which is always

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:19,100
super convenient so actually interacting

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,720
with these tab pages I have what's

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,150
called a default tab page handler so you

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,560
give it just a layout file it provides a

00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,750
layout server you can get it on your

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,120
iPhone and if you can finish the Ross

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,040
tutorials then you can move sliders and

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,350
dials and get information back from the

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,990
user of the phone super simple it's it's

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,200
basically I think 25 lines of code and I

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,960
did plotted out the accelerometer data

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,430
from the ipad on the display on the

00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,130
iphone so there's a youtube video you

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,580
can look it up it's it's it's fairly

00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:55,100
simple in addition to the this default

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,650
handler i also have sort of these named

00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,360
views of the robot so the first one is a

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,090
tella up and that's what we were doing

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,830
earlier with the husky when it's sort of

00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:06,320
went bowling for turtle bots as we're

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:08,390
calling it it works with holonomic and

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,940
differential robots I drove the pr2 and

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:14,660
simulation because the Raffles coming up

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,490
next right okay so and it's also got

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,990
mutual exclusion on the controls so

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:21,200
nobody can take control from another

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,900
person and then all of that all of the

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,810
clients actually see what the guy in

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,670
command is doing additionally there's a

00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,980
Diagnostics handler let's see if we can

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,540
blow that up yes okay so there's a

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,340
Diagnostics handler because all of us

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,110
have Diagnostics on our robots and we

00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,400
want to be able to see them so this is

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,020
kind of what that looks like you get a

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,520
nice little list shows all the hardware

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,170
that's running not very much here

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,600
considering running on my laptop at the

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,520
time and not on a robot and you get big

00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,150
status LEDs which are good for your

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:52,280
project project sponsors and advisors so

00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,490
green is good yellow is not good and red

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,940
is really bad so anybody can understand

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,730
that

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,770
so some of the limitations touchosc is

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,470
UDP only so it's not really super

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,850
reliable that being said I Drive around

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,970
the lawn mower with it and if you have a

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,310
325 pound with cutting blades on the

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,230
front of it I still have all my toes

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,030
William still has all his toes and there

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,870
aren't really big holes in the walls in

00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,640
brown so everything is okay it's it's

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,650
reliable enough i guess you could say

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,510
osc bridge does actually support both

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,050
UDP and tcp so if you have a device that

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:30,120
is TCP you can do it that way the custom

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,830
layouts there is an Android app so

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,900
before you go to the android store and

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,770
buy the android version of touch osc it

00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:40,410
does not support custom layouts so

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,180
that's kind of a kind of a big drawback

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,550
don't waste your four dollars or

00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,440
whatever that the app costs so we are

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:48,930
sort of reliant on an external developer

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,380
for updates for that that being said

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,090
there is an iOS sig that i actually

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,980
discovered today so if anybody is

00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,010
interested in maybe the future of ross

00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:01,800
on iOS devices you should go to the

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,360
groovy planning page and sign up there

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,090
that should be getting off the ground

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,410
here in the next couple days and then I

00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,510
guess the other limitation is that it's

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,190
only Python I don't really see that as a

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,890
limitation because I'm not a huge fan of

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,340
C++ but you know some people might be a

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,380
bit disappointed so current status

00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:22,850
everything that I showed you here today

00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,740
does work so there are video tutorials

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,410
there are actual tutorials on the Ross

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,210
wiki and all of the wiki pages and

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,060
documentation is all auto generated the

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,920
way it's supposed to be and then over

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,350
this summer I plan on adding kind of

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,960
interface for Ross bag application

00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:42,270
management and then some more GUI tools

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,750
for layout manipulation and things like

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,220
that so with that kind of breeze through

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,780
there so everybody can get on their way

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,780
