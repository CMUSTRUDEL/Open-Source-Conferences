good morning

00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,490
it's like shooting fish in a barrel my

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,789
name is Brian gurkey from Willow Garage

00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,640
and I'm here to welcome you to the first

00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:26,140
Ross con very excited that all you guys

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,210
came out

00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,040
we've already frankly exceeded my

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,989
expectations in terms of what kind of

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,780
turnout we could get here and I think it

00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:36,790
says a lot about the future of the

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,379
community that we built around open

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,290
source software for robots that you

00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:42,670
folks found it important enough to come

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,309
out and spend your weekend and st. Paul

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,280
talking about it so we've got a great

00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,160
program lined up and the talks I think

00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,450
are going to be fantastic but this is

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,579
also just a chance for us to all meet

00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,770
each other so most of us only know each

00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:58,360
other by email addresses and this is a

00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,390
chance to put a face to the name

00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,860
really get to talking about what it is

00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,229
we're doing with robots where we see it

00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,970
all going establish new collaborations

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:10,899
start companies whatever you think is

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,240
you know relevant so welcome to Ross con

00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:16,060
2012 first I'd like to thank our

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,260
sponsors we've got some great companies

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,909
who have made this event really possible

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,280
and I encourage you throughout the

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:27,100
weekend to check out our exhibit area

00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,810
next door so a lot of the sponsors have

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,150
set up tables out there they're showing

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,700
off robots it's also intended to be a

00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,530
robot hacking area so it's a place for

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,180
you to go over I know there are a lot of

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,890
turtle BOTS and variants on turtle BOTS

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,500
there's opportunities to write code make

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:47,439
robots do things whatever you think is

00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:49,979
fun that room is is wide open I'd also

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,820
like to thank our organizing committee

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,159
couldn't have pulled this off without

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,430
this group of people who really put a

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,869
lot of time and effort into making the

00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,869
core decisions about where we're gonna

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:04,600
hold the conference how it's gonna run

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,220
and we've got Ryan grip' and Matt

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,679
Williamson right here Cedric bird Ally I

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,679
couldn't make it but a big thanks to him

00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:18,579
also the program committee so these are

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:22,050
the folks who reviewed the proposals

00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:24,459
that we got and really influenced the

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,530
decision as to what presentations you're

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,280
gonna see here so this a big thanks to

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,870
these folks

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,450
we recruited these people just so you

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,680
know from the sig coordinators so these

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,260
are the folks who signed up for the

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,280
fuerte special interest groups and we

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,110
figured that was the right group of

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,040
people to be looking over the proposals

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,040
so those are the folks that really

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,470
shaped the program which you should all

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,400
have a copy of in your in your swag bag

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,650
I think it's a great program and I'll

00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,690
mention that we had a great response to

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:59,080
the call for proposals so we ended up

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,760
with an acceptance rate of 27% which if

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,250
you guys were at acre this week this is

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,350
a lot lower than Hickory so where it's

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,260
great to be eight to be able to afford

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,610
to be selective and I think I think

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,050
you'll be happy with the presentations

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,390
that that we've got for you a little bit

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:20,020
of logistics bookkeeping we'll have a

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:23,230
break each day at 10:30 and then again

00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,390
at 3:30 and we've got lunch at 12:30

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,380
each day the brakes and the lunches are

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,850
catered they're gonna happen right

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,700
outside so they're gonna set up a buffet

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,970
there for lunch each day and also coffee

00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,600
and snacks that's all included with your

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:41,370
registration another person I'd like to

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,489
thank is our publicity chair Ken Conley

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,650
why am i showing you a picture of Ken

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:51,670
because this evening we have an hour

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,519
blocked off for lightning talks so this

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,920
is an opportunity to get up here on

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,620
stage and frankly say whatever you want

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,079
if you've got some piece of software

00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,370
that you want to advertise then you know

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,239
spend a couple of minutes to tell people

00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,160
about it you've got an interesting

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,709
project that you want to tell people

00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,769
about get up here make it fun whatever

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:14,470
you want to do you can come up here and

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:17,979
say it and where is Ken Ken's at the

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,209
back so you need to if you want to do a

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:20,140
lightning talk you need to see Ken

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,320
sometime today

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,520
but before 4:00 p.m. Ken's EMC for the

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,800
lightning talks he's gonna put together

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,360
a schedule if you want to use slides you

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,940
need to get them to Ken he's gonna put

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,440
that all together into one deck so that

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,540
we can run through it quickly and Ken's

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,510
gonna hand out time I expect it's not

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,680
more than a few minutes each and you

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,090
don't have to use slides don't feel

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,590
obliged to make up slide so this is a

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,240
chance to really

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:46,750
talk about anything make it make it fun

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,260
and interesting so let's talk about you

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:52,390
guys this is a breakdown of registration

00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,300
by type as of yesterday afternoon we had

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,680
201 people registered which like I said

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,170
totally exceeded at least my

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,720
expectations if you look at the

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:06,090
breakdown by type what I think is really

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,650
most promising is that we've got 40%

00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,750
non-students so some of these folks some

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,430
of you folks are maybe professors

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,960
meeting non students but the majority of

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,630
the non students are actually working

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,390
for companies and I think that is where

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,330
the future of Ross is it's in getting

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,550
the software out in to industry people

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,130
actually using it to do product

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,720
development I think that the obviously

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,460
we're still supporting the research

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,490
community and that's a big part of our

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,350
user base but the future to my mind is

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,700
on the commercial side it's getting this

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,990
stuff that we're building out of the lab

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,860
and into the real world

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,290
I made a word cloud cuz everybody needs

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,140
a word cloud this is a word cloud of

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,110
your affiliations so you get some sense

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,880
of what's important lots of universities

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,760
Willow Garage is somewhat prominent in

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,410
there but also lots of companies and

00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,310
again I think that's that's really where

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,140
the where the future is very few of you

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,090
actually filled in geographical

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,560
information so this is actually not

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,890
taken from the registration this is

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,440
taken from a crowd-sourced map that is

00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,110
linked to from the Ross org wiki so this

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,640
is you guys reporting some of you and

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,820
some other folks reporting where you are

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,930
as a Ross user or Ross developer so as

00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,180
you can see we've got pretty good

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,370
coverage in North America and in Europe

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,500
and we're starting to get penetration in

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:29,500
Asia we've got friends using Ross in

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:34,540
Japan South Korea and I think that's

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,430
only gonna increase you guys may have

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,320
heard about the open source robotics

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:40,630
foundation there was a press release I

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,490
think last week about it so this is an

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,750
exciting new development we've been

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,260
talking about creating some kind of

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,730
nonprofit foundation to support work in

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,190
open source robot software for a long

00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,080
time and we went ahead and did that

00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,220
recently

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
there'll be you'll be hearing more about

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,780
this over time

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,430
what kind of projects we're gonna be

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,980
working on we're still putting the

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,919
organization together but one thing I

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,139
will mention is that we're hiring so

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,280
check out the jobs page if you want to

00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,680
work for the open source robotics

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,220
foundation it'll be in the Bay Area it's

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,600
a pretty cool place to live also

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,300
connected with the open source robotics

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,610
foundation you all know that we had the

00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,910
raw square to release a month before

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:25,160
last month in fact there are 48 t-shirts

00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,419
for sale out front and proceeds go to

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,120
the open source robotics foundation

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:31,610
we're taking cash and I think we've got

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,110
a credit card thing set up as well so if

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,970
you want to Ross wear a t-shirt those

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:40,040
are for sale out front starting with the

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:44,780
first break we had a last-minute sponsor

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:48,950
in an rec and we're very happy to have

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,600
nrx sponsor and in fact they're

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,000
sponsoring a reception that's happening

00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,220
tonight so at the close of the lightning

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,070
talk six o'clock there's going to be a

00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,620
catered hosted bar reception out here

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,750
so that's roughly 6:00 to 7:30 so it's a

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,880
good time to mix have a drink get a

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:09,410
snack and we'd really like to thank n

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,990
rec for putting that on more logistics

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,020
there is free Wi-Fi here this is the e

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,970
SSID and you go to a webpage and you put

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,169
in password is the wrong thing that

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,390
should be promo code you'll go to a

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,280
webpage you put in promo code all caps

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,229
downtown it's been a little bit

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,880
unreliable but it seems to be mostly

00:08:24,229 --> 00:08:30,710
working related point there aren't that

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,640
many places to plug in laptops in here

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,909
there are tables across from the town

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,250
square

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,930
be where the exhibits are and there are

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,490
charging stations there so if you need

00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:45,530
to recharge something you can go over

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:48,350
there birds of a feather so like I said

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,420
at the beginning one of the points of

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,950
having a meeting like this is so we can

00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,540
get to know each other if we just wanted

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,860
to have talks we could just do webcasts

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,870
the point of coming together physically

00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,180
is to be able to have ad hoc

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,670
conversations with each other so also

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,020
next door in the exhibit area on this

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,400
wall there are post-its and markers and

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,059
that's an opportunity for you guys to

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,249
self-organize in

00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,709
you birds of a feather sessions so it's

00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:15,269
very simple if you have a topic that you

00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,789
want to propose go in there right around

00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,409
a sheet of paper stick it on the wall

00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:21,299
say where you want to meet when you want

00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:23,879
to meet and people will come by with

00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,559
other sticky notes and vote to indicate

00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,299
interest and then if there's another

00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,089
enough interest you guys should come

00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:32,819
together and talk about whatever it is I

00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:35,339
recommend scheduling those talks after

00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:36,929
hours or during the breaks that way

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,969
people won't be conflicted with coming

00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:41,689
in here and and essentially missing the

00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:41,689
