alright lightning talks so this is the

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,550
developer conference lightning talks are

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,019
one of my favorite things that happen at

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,240
a lot of developer conferences it gives

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,940
you a chance to sample the breadth of

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,910
the three to four thousand Ross packages

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,710
that are out there in a very concise a

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:23,699
DD we're going to be drinking beer after

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,710
this format so we'll try and bridge this

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,750
people give in lightning talks you'll

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,369
see your name in the bottom right if

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,940
you're on deck you'll say next your name

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,410
so get up here as quickly as you can so

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,360
it can keep breezing through this and

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,040
remember you have three minutes we're

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,620
going to hard cut you off because again

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,450
beer so give a letting talk by

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,280
demonstration what does Ross awesome do

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,410
this is probably most frequently asked

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,899
question I get in person when someone

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:55,500
comes to lunch at Willow Garage so

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,350
that's our TFS it's very easy Ross

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,449
awesome is kind of a historical hat tip

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,409
to the many names that Morgan inflicted

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,489
on Ross so you can see that it basically

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,229
reintroduces those original names we

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,810
have mega made and suck to blow which

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,580
are good old spaceballs references my

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,020
favorite was actually not by Morgan by

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,909
this but one of our interns Alex

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,259
Teachman who did Dustbuster it recorded

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:22,979
one message and that last one is bought

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:27,630
herder not bought the order or bothered

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,280
her but we took all these out of the

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,479
system because in the end conventions

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,060
are good to let you learn the system

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,799
more quickly so good convention that we

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,350
decided on is anything dealing with Ross

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,729
is Ross and then the name of the concept

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,100
so mega made was bad Ross play also was

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,920
bad because play wasn't the concept bag

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,680
was the concept so we renamed it to Ross

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,710
bag to keep it nice and simple of course

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,970
oops we have some deprecated code in our

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,250
source because we're using the

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,680
deprecated aliases but that's okay and

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,380
as a final question I'll let you decide

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,689
if Ross WTF is good or bad by this

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,759
convention but as Damon color was tell

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,600
me its it may not be Ross awesome but

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,600
it's definitely Rossum

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,030
all right Ross industrial it's a status

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,920
update a lot of people mentioned it in

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,290
their talks today so am I going to go a

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,050
lot of detail but what we're doing is

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,190
leveraging Ross for the factory floor

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,470
we're starting with arms but we have

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,330
other applications that have nothing to

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:44,370
do with arms that Ross can help us with

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,980
supported hardware that means we have

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,920
visualizations urd apps and various

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,780
levels of support for them Motoman adept

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,620
abb those are all industrial

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,799
manipulators EtherCAT via the simple

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,150
open EtherCAT master library and more to

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,569
come we're talking lots of people about

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,519
this development is continuing we have a

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,040
free tale project at sweary look in the

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,080
repository if you're curious and Motoman

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,920
is working on faster interfaces and more

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,630
robots special thanks to Willow Garage

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,160
Southwest Research in motorman we're

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,870
going to start a consortium fourth

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,340
quarter 2012 or first quarter 13 and

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,500
we're looking for developers who are

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,390
interested this and interested in

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:33,180
helping us there we go and there are

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:35,730
some links lots of information if you

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,130
want to look us up on the web and one

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,690
last thing enter Ross enterprise which

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,549
is a cig that's kind of forming that

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,350
we're very interested in it's going to

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,880
meet at six o'clock in the ballroom and

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,680
we're going to meet on this side of the

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,670
ballroom so that we can all get together

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,670
for dinner it sounds like

00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:19,130
hi I'm Chad Jenkins I'm associate

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,169
professor of computer science of Brown

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,460
University who is always looking for

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,880
great students postdocs and

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,639
collaborators and one as an example of

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,110
what I do with my students and postdocs

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,880
and collaborators is I just want to show

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,900
a quick video of a hackathon we had

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,900
earlier this year

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:44,230
I can't believe I had to follow that and

00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,250
I don't even have a funky music and

00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,800
you're going to show me how to do it

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,480
this summer um I'm just Steve cousins

00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,610
from little garage and I got asked the

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,470
question what is the OS RF and why did

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,180
you guys spin it out and so I thought I

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,480
would take two minutes to answer that or

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,710
so so open source robotics foundation

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,010
you notice if you take off the

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,720
foundation part as OS RF and there's an

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,480
interesting permutation of our OS off it

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,820
turn turns out there's a guy named Ross

00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,620
with our OS last name he died his family

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,840
as a foundation we can't have that name

00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,130
so we have the OpenSocial radish

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,620
foundation which is nice because it's

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,090
more general and also lets us include

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,360
things like gazebo and other open-source

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:24,850
robotics packages the Foundation exists

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,250
because we want a central place where

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:29,590
different organizations entities can

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,450
contribute money that's not will garage

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,280
why not Willow Garage well we make

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,410
robots other companies make robots if

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,270
we're owning the software even if it's

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,440
bsd it feels to everybody like well we

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,560
shouldn't give you money to support that

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,720
right but I want Ross to be a community

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,920
effort it's a it is already a community

00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,500
effort but I want people to realize that

00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,330
and if you look back in history there's

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,860
Ross org right why is there Ross org

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,900
first of all it's shorter than Willow

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,300
Garage com but more importantly at ends

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,850
in gorg right and so when we created

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,350
rasta org we created Ross we said this

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,330
is BS d this is open to the community

00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,340
it's a community effort Willow Garage

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,900
contributes to it but everybody else can

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,550
contribute to it too and we've been

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,010
looking for the last two years for an

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,320
opportunity for to create this

00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,700
foundation this this central position

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,090
and what we're looking for really was

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,860
funding and so recently DARPA has the

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,440
robotics challenge they were looking for

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,790
someone to do the simulator and so we

00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,680
said this is a great opportunity such a

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,260
great match so DARPA's putting a big

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,630
chunk of money in to improve gazebo and

00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:31,810
so the gazebo team and Brian have gone

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,460
off to create OS RF and we have now one

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,560
more player in the Ross community more

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,169
importantly a player that will support

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,030
the long-term health and ability of Ross

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,470
so Willow Garage continues to be

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,140
interested in Ross will continue to have

00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,430
developers working on Ross you notice

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,100
the Ross team and the people that are

00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,170
speaking most of them will continue to

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,970
work for bula garage

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,500
but we now have another player in town

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,960
who's also supporting it with which we

00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,550
think is just fantastic so I want to say

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,340
one more thing which is how am i doing

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,080
45 seconds excellent one more thing

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,610
which is wonder I was watching the bull

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,370
garage talks this morning and somebody

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,110
said third party right like here's our

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,940
packages and here's third party packages

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,190
which I want to publicly correct for

00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,570
everyone Ross is for all of us there is

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,430
no third party or we're all third

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,620
parties right there's no there's no

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,210
Center and this move that's creating the

00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,320
open-source robotics foundation just

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,750
makes that a little bit more obvious

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,400
right if we all contribute to it we all

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,510
use what's there and from any given

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,520
institutions point of view maybe

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,990
everything else is third party but for

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,090
all of us it's all one big happy

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,440
community so welcome to the Ross

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,700
community I'm glad you're all here this

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,700
fantastic event thanks Brian

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,179
three minutes okay so um I'm Jonathan

00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:58,730
Carson's I'm from South Africa's yes are

00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:01,189
we do a lot of work with mining industry

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,109
so one of the things we do is we want to

00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:05,959
put an operator of a vehicle on the

00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:08,239
surface and take his job put a machine

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,249
there to do it for him one of the issues

00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:12,949
is that with someone who's used to doing

00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:15,589
it himself he needs a very simple

00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:17,119
software interface very simple so we

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,699
can't really put our vision for anything

00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:21,439
with topics and so what we doing at the

00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:26,259
moment is working toward a customizable

00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:28,910
version of virus so just to advertise it

00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:31,459
basically the first starting point for

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,199
us was to get to basically remake to

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,359
basically take some sections orifice as

00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:38,600
well and make a customizable version of

00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:40,699
just arvest and then from there the idea

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,679
is to take it to a point where it's a

00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,259
very very easy interface so at the

00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:49,459
moment we have this basically is your

00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:51,980
standard markets I've also added some so

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,509
you can support now with CRA it supports

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,669
the standard messages or your point

00:10:53,509 --> 00:11:00,169
clouds your grid maps that sort of thing

00:10:55,669 --> 00:11:02,179
and I've added support for the URI DF

00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:03,709
format as well although it's a separate

00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:07,100
program that you run and it imports it

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:09,519
as markers so or the menu system in the

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,619
thing and most of the the sort of

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,629
housekeeping stuff is all Python you can

00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:17,419
rewrite that very easily I've added also

00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:18,649
I say completely script Olympic easy not

00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,829
true actually it's computing scriptable

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:23,209
scriptable in Python so the example here

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,350
is in the technology test of the

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:29,539
software if you click on a bubble it

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,919
explodes because there's a script so

00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:33,889
there's a node that sends a script

00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:36,709
python script 2d visualizer that the

00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,809
softcore CRI and it tells it to publish

00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,329
a message to the program and the program

00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,949
tells then CRI to destroy the bubble so

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:45,410
there's a scripting element to it that

00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:48,619
regard as well and I've started working

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:52,850
on being able to specify change through

00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:55,999
a variant of the interactive marker so

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:58,429
you can actually now also specify TF

00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:00,499
change as well as complicated sort of

00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:01,879
goals or if you want it for instance I'm

00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:03,560
working on this at the moment that you

00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,790
you can for instance

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,290
make an object if you wanted to be in a

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,580
certain place on the table you make you

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,320
pick underneath the object a certain

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:14,480
point you want to the table and you can

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:17,620
make the two so basically that's the low

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,000
down the road map is really to do what I

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,940
said earlier is to make a very simple

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,470
version of iris that someone just off

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,610
the street can use completely off the

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:30,890
street and of course also to then grow

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:33,470
it into an IDE so that you can make your

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,520
you interface very quickly and hack it

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,520
if you need but that's

00:12:54,589 --> 00:13:05,279
hello my name is Jonathan born and I'm

00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:07,230
the graduate student so so this means of

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,279
course that the goal over the course of

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,649
the next few years is for me to do

00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,999
science but in addition to doing science

00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:13,459
I'm also be writing a lot of software

00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:16,920
and I have written a lot of software and

00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,959
I think a lot of people have noticed the

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,910
wild code that Morgan referred to this

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,730
morning and a lot of that wild code is

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,040
written by graduate students and I think

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,499
that a lot of graduate students actually

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,059
don't have a lot of experience in doing

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:33,449
software development or doing releases

00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:36,299
or maintaining code and I think there's

00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:39,540
a potential for the open-source robotics

00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:41,129
foundation to help us with this and what

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,049
I'm proposing is something along the

00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,329
lines of open-source robotics foundation

00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:48,420
student chapters at universities

00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:51,329
organizations to either guide or set up

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:55,199
protocols or basically an able to enable

00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:57,239
us to better create code that others can

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,069
use as opposed to this sort of half

00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:00,809
working jumbled stuff that might have

00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:03,089
been in a project once and isn't

00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:05,549
maintained anymore and I think it could

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:09,749
really really benefit the community and

00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:11,189
as well as a set up sort of you know a

00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,169
situation where we're not just

00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:15,149
publishing academic papers but we're

00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:16,319
also publishing the code that goes into

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,029
those papers so that others can

00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,860
reproduce our experiments I think

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,049
there's a lot of potential here to to

00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,519
really sort of take advantage of this

00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:25,049
whole community and the sort of new

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
paradigms and how robotics research is

00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:27,199
done

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,660
and there's a birds of a feather thing

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,730
I'm not quite sure when it's going to

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,050
happen but uh just meet up with me

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,840
probably after the banquet and we'll

00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:48,080
figure it out or the reception reception

00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,080
the Enric reception

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,050
right 11 right okay I'm Bob Deena from

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,600
general dynamics robotic systems where

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,710
one of the hard real-time companies that

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,240
was mentioned a couple times earlier

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:22,470
today our specialty is in super of

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,840
what's called supervised Deltana me

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,180
we've done high speed on road off red

00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,980
stuff for a very long time as part of

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,750
that we traditionally made our own laid

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,400
ours because it's a great sensing system

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,210
so what I'm going to talk about is

00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,050
something we have something called a

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:40,050
micro radar there we go page down it's

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:42,270
smaller than a soda can which gives

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:43,680
basically gives a 3d depth range grayed

00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,120
out just like traditional lady ours do

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,840
if you used a valid I'm then you know

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,910
the type of data to expect and the neat

00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,230
thing about this is that so this looks

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,790
is about a tenth of a second what the

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,280
data looks kind of what you get out of a

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:58,560
standard laid are our laid our does a

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,900
phase shift with a multi return so what

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,090
that means is that there will be no gaps

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,410
in your data like you do with

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,810
traditional light ours where you'll have

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,540
your scan lines and then at an angular

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,740
difference which increases with range so

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,660
we can see here this was taken in

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,030
someone's office so that's picture of

00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,560
some curtains in a cabinet and the neat

00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,210
thing about the cabret is you can see

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,160
the seam of the door that goes up the

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,770
left hand side which I've been doing

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,670
this for many many years I've never seen

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,620
later they could actually do something

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,350
like that the colors in here are

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,940
actually intensity so we do give

00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,980
intensity out with our data is a picture

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,340
of our test area so this is just to show

00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,480
you we have a longer range in the center

00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,450
there there's some test targets with

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,040
also showing intensity and right now

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,680
we're getting range greater than 60

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,190
meters that's the number i'm allowed to

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,560
say and this should be on the market a

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,240
couple weeks and production yields we're

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,160
looking at something substantially

00:16:51,240 --> 00:17:00,920
cheaper than velodyne 32e friends about

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,920
20 watts and that's that

00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,490
hey I'm Brandon Alexander um I've been

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,380
trying to get web developers into ross

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,240
basically may cross more accessible to

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,600
web developers I don't let quickly as

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,640
for tools that I found help with that

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,810
the first one is Ross yes it's a

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,600
JavaScript library that lets you

00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,650
interact with Ross in the browser that's

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,980
all I'm going to go into it because

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,870
there's a big talk on it tomorrow the

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,760
next one though is a client library a

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,190
JavaScript client library that was

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,070
recently released called Ross nodejs and

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,480
you can get to it by googling but that

00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,460
actually lets you write JavaScript that

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,230
will match the similar Ross jsapi in the

00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,180
browser and so you can actually

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:58,890
JavaScript on the robot directly with no

00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:01,950
browser the third one is deployment

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:03,900
scripts so a lot of web developers they

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,660
can deploy a whole server with one

00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:09,750
script using things like chef and other

00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,180
and big R and other deployment tools so

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,550
I'm trying to get some of those tools to

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,590
integrate with Ross so if you actually

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,810
go to my github address now I have a

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,550
script that uses chef and vagrant so you

00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,790
can create a whole Ross environment from

00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:25,380
scratch and one line I'm hoping to see

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,390
more of that involvement in the future

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,050
so we can kind of work together with

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:32,870
things like chef puppet vagrant for Ross

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:37,620
so you can quickly set up an environment

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:40,080
a fourth one github I think a lot of

00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,240
people should use it more I know that

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,700
feel controversial but as an example

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,830
when I release Ross nodejs within four

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,560
hours without announcing it to anybody I

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,690
had someone fork the project and start

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,010
making changes so I just think it opens

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,930
up the code makes a lot more accessible

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,130
to to unveil vers and the people out

00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,130
there thanks

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,800
yeah good evening welcome to the pH

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,900
flight trajectory planner stack my name

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,310
is Ganesh Kumar I work with my advisor

00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,870
dr. shreek on sorry Polly at the

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,410
astrolabe of Arizona State University

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:42,470
and this is probably one of the wild

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:44,120
code modules that but mentioned earlier

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,410
today by Morgan quickly so you would

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:53,570
never know when it is going to hit you

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:55,190
when you use it a pue spline never is an

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,770
abbreviation for a really long term

00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,120
nevermind what exactly it is and it is a

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,130
variation of a spline that was recently

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,900
developed to interpolate smoothly

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,710
between waypoints on a robotic

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,390
trajectory they have a number of cool

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,490
elegant mathematical properties

00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,800
including the fact that there arc length

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,560
can be evaluated purely analytical and

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:22,490
you can see a pH lines here displayed

00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:25,610
here it's a matlab plot so we wrote a ph

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,290
spline based trajectory planner our

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,170
design is very simple we use move base

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,550
for the base local planner we ripped off

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,980
the gold passer from the navigation

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:36,200
experimental stack and we substituted a

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,090
PS plain gold passer and similarly we

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,360
had a PS plain post follower following

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:43,970
the simple post follower and we have an

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,130
auxiliary package known as PS flying

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,220
generator that plugs into the gold

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,520
password the generator talks to MATLAB

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:57,740
so this part the PS pain generator and

00:20:52,520 --> 00:21:01,100
MATLAB from the heart of a code so there

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,980
are a number of configuration parameters

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,780
in such a way that they really suit you

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,490
for example you can evade the loops or

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:13,370
you can use control points instead of

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:15,830
waypoints and so forth so here is one

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,840
simple pH plane all I say right now is

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,260
that you can see that the spline on the

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,150
right is much smoother than the path on

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,150
the Left which is one of the main uses

00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,110
so in future I hope to maintain it I

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,350
have a few years of software development

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:38,240
experience luckily so so I hope to

00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,640
maintain it in such a way that you all

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,310
get to use it extremely well and I plan

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,170
to use the Ross matlab I IPC bridge

00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:48,200
instead of the file based communication

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:50,990
we have here and we all we are also

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,430
ambitious enough to make this work on

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,430
the hectare quadrotor stack and

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,210
unfortunately it's a little bit I can't

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,840
understand why it's not my per hit you

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:29,530
or anything but uh so this was meant to

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,530
you can see a robot yeah yeah thank you

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:56,100
hello my name is mike so the sky cam

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:58,080
from Poland my company I founded 2004 is

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,160
doing small robots and now we are

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:07,020
entering Ross you can see the team of

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:10,140
five doing allying and I use CC 0 you

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,250
see service director Ross architect who

00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,419
is here with me you have cash source and

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:18,360
chief constructor an assistant

00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:22,470
constructor now we are moving I would

00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,860
like to show you where we are and be

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:30,510
where we are going tomorrow and now we

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:34,580
have entered the project of fleet or

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:39,270
swarm of robots we are going to use Ross

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:41,630
to develop it and if you see some other

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,340
calling from robotics inventions please

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,530
remember that I was standing here and

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:51,570
asking you for help so I'm asking you

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:54,660
for help if something goes wrong we r we

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:57,390
r bangalore for for robotics if you need

00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,460
some outsourcing you can you can talk to

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:03,690
us and maybe you can come over to you

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,820
and help you otherwise please remember

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,460
that maybe next year we'll come over

00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:13,190
here with with several robots that are

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,190
working and cooperating together thank

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,460
hi my name is Paul Boucher from the

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,080
Dallas personal robotics group we've got

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,050
a group down there that are very excited

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,780
about rice I'm hobbyist and there's a

00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,910
class of robot controllers that was not

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,610
addressed in Morgan's talk this morning

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:50,080
smaller than small bark but bigger than

00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,360
what he called MicroBot I've got an

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,030
example of one here but there's several

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,670
things like Chum be things like routers

00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:59,500
that have USB ports on them this is a

00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,170
vex pro controller I've used them all

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,230
their their characteristics are there

00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:07,510
low-cost physically small they run Linux

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:08,790
which says a lot about the cut power of

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,410
things that you can do with them

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:14,410
typically an arm 9 controller typically

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,360
with 16 megs of flash so to megs of ram

00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:19,300
so that says a lot about what you can't

00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,060
do with them can't load a full rostock

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,150
and those kinds of things but the USB

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:27,550
enables camera's USB to serial which you

00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:29,710
can hook up to an Arduino four senses

00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,340
and the like and they have enough

00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:36,400
horsepower for reactive control and and

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:38,860
vision capture so what we want to do is

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,540
connect them in two rows so we have an

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:45,700
idea of implementing in Arduino library

00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:48,280
on them is one approach and using raw

00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:51,850
serial so i ported about half of the

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:56,650
base Arduino environment to the vex pro

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:58,690
controller here and and the idea is the

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:02,230
idea there is that a good bit of the ID

00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:04,090
we know community code or to run on

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,340
these linux boxes which gives you a lot

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:10,900
of flexibility in in terms of wireless

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,910
socket access and and the like a second

00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,370
approach that we are that we're playing

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,110
with is this for this controller is

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,080
actually based on a previous product

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,420
called Ra's quark and I'm sorry called a

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,220
quick controller and there's a module in

00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,650
rise called Ra's quark which we're

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:30,070
trying to get trying to get working on

00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:33,730
on the controller so they've got a URL

00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:38,190
for the for the subversion source for

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,780
this code and would welcome comments

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:43,140
considerations things we should keep in

00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:46,710
mind for this class of

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,020
of embedded controllers and I thought

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,510
I'd bring this in because so full

00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,130
disclosure here vex robotics is a

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,720
sponsor of the Dallas personal robotics

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,950
group but I brought it in because I

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,530
thought it might be interesting to you

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,750
guys because it is aimed at the at the

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:04,140
University and research market it does

00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:07,020
give you linux and has some decent power

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,460
io going directly onto the board and i

00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,980
thought the reason it might be

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,320
interesting to you guys is it would

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,840
integrate with senses that you can buy

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,920
off the shelf and metal and such as I've

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,030
done here which reduces the overhead of

00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,310
getting your double e's and you're Amy's

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,780
involved in making your motors and

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,240
sensors and electronics and all that

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,640
work it just plugs together so that's

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,950
where we're going trying to trying to

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,620
get Ross integrated with this class of

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,620
embedded Linux controller thank

00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,310
so hello everybody my name is Thomas

00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,980
Wayne from um I'm not really an expert

00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,570
in this field but I felt in my work that

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,450
I would like to have uncertainty

00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,740
reflected in TF so I didn't announce

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,170
this widely because it's a really

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,910
finished so far you can only sample but

00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,220
you can already specify uncertainty in

00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:07,350
rotation and in translation as well as

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,900
in time so our use cases for example we

00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,490
are seeing some data in our connect and

00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,040
we're not really sure when the frame was

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,260
taken by the Kinect and maybe the robot

00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,520
moved while it was doing so maybe they

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,010
have some joints that we are not so sure

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,900
about so this is you find this on the

00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,150
uncertainty f I just felt this might be

00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,830
a forum to announce this if anybody here

00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,630
wants to use this so once to contribute

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,090
would be nice to talk to you it to you

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:34,970
guys I I think that that's enough this

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,970
was like 40 seconds

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,019
we started five minutes over okay hi I'm

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,760
Doug Thomas I just want to give you a

00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,919
short information on what's going on for

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,899
you I tools for us currently ross

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,700
features some tools you know Ross RX

00:28:55,899 --> 00:29:00,100
ross graph and stuff like that it's all

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,659
building wxwidgets novel technology not

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,179
very good maintainable not cross

00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:05,980
platform and usually you'd lose it use a

00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:09,039
lot of tools at the same time you always

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,510
set it up again looking again so we want

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,610
to come up with an architecture for you

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,139
graphical user tools in Ross so we

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,019
developed a framework which builds on

00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:18,909
top of cute so it's cross-platform it's

00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,610
implemented in Python you either pie

00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:23,110
side up egg cubic cute pace and it's

00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,760
featured featuring a plug-in

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,470
architecture so you can plug in

00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,230
arbitrary plugins providing your own

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,269
custom user interface stuff and they can

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,039
be either written in Python or C++ and

00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,350
you don't have to deal with binding

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,299
stuff the framework itself is ross

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:40,360
independent and the integration to ross

00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:42,549
is done by a plugin and the features of

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,669
that is you can run plugins multiple

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:47,169
instances at the same time you can

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:49,299
provide arbitrary widgets you need for

00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:51,940
your UI you can safely restore the state

00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:53,019
automatically you have perspectives like

00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,789
in eclipse you can switch between

00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:57,580
different combinations of plugins and

00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,380
you can run them in multiple processes

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,210
and the same processes or even stand

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,630
alone just an impression what we

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:07,539
currently have we get RX graph poured it

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,399
to that technology don't look too

00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:12,159
detailed on the verbose output on the

00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:14,740
top we can reduce or can improve the UI

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,750
the advantage of using cute here is you

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,309
can Hoover you can hover over the

00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,080
individual nodes you get high lightning

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,820
which is coming in which is going out

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,950
like we saw the graph before in the

00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,620
presentation from clear path the graph

00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,659
was not very easily visible with this

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,919
one you get much more high lightning you

00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:31,720
got the tools you have on the command

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,429
line right like you're off topic you can

00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,289
do with topic introspection you can

00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:38,950
unfold the message you can easily see

00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:41,500
and observe what messages are really

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,330
posted and you have the opposite you can

00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,919
have like post arbitrary kinds of

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:48,340
messages you just select the message

00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:50,970
type unfold all types put in formulas to

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:54,539
just publish arbitrary messages

00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:56,429
and also have plugins arranged beside

00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:58,620
each other stack them on top have them

00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:00,960
in separate windows whatever you like so

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,730
on the right side you see 2d plotting as

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,250
our exploit provides that we've

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,559
previously and those things to do next

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,630
on that is we are currently doing some

00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,630
cleanup want to provide deviant packages

00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:13,530
in the next couple of weeks and of

00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:16,620
course someone has to write

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:18,390
documentation and the big thing is we

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,400
need more plugins we need to improve the

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,140
current plugins so if you have you I it

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,330
tools which you need which you're

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,640
currently building or building in the

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:27,990
future come and talk to me maybe it's

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,580
possible to integrate them into that

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,580
architecture thank you

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:58,820
ensuring so I I neglected the on deck

00:31:49,130 --> 00:32:00,320
one video hi I'm Ian Sherman I'm an

00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,940
engineer at bot & dolly which is a small

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,380
company in San Francisco that's kept a

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,659
pretty low profile for the last year or

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,220
two but we are really excited to start

00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:11,139
reaching out in meeting people in the

00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:15,559
robotics community we are applying

00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:17,420
sixaxis industrial robots to the film

00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,370
industry so

00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:23,000
we're seeing here is a motion test that

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:26,090
we did where we've got a remote head on

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
a large cuca robot wrapping up a proof

00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:33,680
of concept using a most I'm going to

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,030
mute it might be distracting um dad is

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:40,130
really emotion tests and what we did was

00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:42,380
we we we did motion capture of this

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,840
fight scene beforehand and then gave the

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:47,480
film director tools to pre-visualized

00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,480
the shot he wanted in Maya and then

00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:53,480
click a button to export to our cuca and

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,040
capture this sort of footage we did our

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,740
first feature film last summer it's

00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,680
called gravity we will simulate anti

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,810
gravity effect some space just using

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:08,330
relative motion of robotic control of

00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:09,860
the camera and we're also interested in

00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,300
co-opted in industrial technology for

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,690
other uses in the creative industry so

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,810
puppeting of robots also projection

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,040
mapping on moving 3d surfaces so that's

00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,020
what we're working on at a low level and

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,200
I'd love to talk to you guys because

00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,490
we're really excited to find out what

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,470
sort of similar problems we're working

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,320
on we're also looking for talent to join

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,930
us but at a higher level I think there's

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,570
two interesting concepts here one is

00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:37,730
robot hardware as a commodity so we're

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:39,020
really lucky to have the mature platform

00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,210
of the cuckoo robot to start working

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:43,970
with and I think projects like Ross

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,500
industrial show really great potential

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,680
for you know third-party integrators

00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,260
like us the second would be motion

00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,600
control is a creative medium in itself

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,400
in the same way that audio or sculpture

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,040
might be so I hope everyone is thinking

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:01,960
about how we can use robotic control for

00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,960
the Arts thanks

00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:24,450
hi I'm Garrett Gallagher and for the

00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:27,120
last year in a bit I've been working on

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:31,020
the billy-bob project with my co-founder

00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:37,020
Juan and Jeff is up front he'll be

00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:40,530
giving a talk later so this was oh this

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,420
is has been a lot of fun we started I

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,520
started basically out of a university

00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:47,430
lab saying hey the Kinect is really cool

00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:51,150
I want to put it on I create and help

00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:54,390
people start doing robotics you know on

00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:57,140
a sort of university level with Ross so

00:34:54,390 --> 00:35:00,090
we got a huge amount of interest and

00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,460
naively said all right well if we can

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:05,340
make a couple then we should be able to

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,620
mass produce them right so we started

00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:11,070
doing that and that it didn't really

00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:16,170
scale so well but we did make 30 of them

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:18,930
and sold them out to various people and

00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,460
that had the advantage of a lot of

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:23,670
freedom we could sort of modify the

00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,730
design and do you know what we thought

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:29,450
people should have and what what people

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:32,850
were telling us that they wanted but

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:38,360
it's sort of hard to scale like that and

00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:42,020
so in February we went off to China to

00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:44,970
start doing like mass production of this

00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:48,630
trying to you know get it out cheaper to

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,610
the even more people but ran into this

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,050
problem where if you want to do mass

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,950
production you need funding and then you

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:58,470
have to sort of sell this to a VC and

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,090
then suddenly we're saying okay now

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,520
we're trying to do this application to

00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:04,440
convince a VC that you know they should

00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,690
give us funding to do this thing but

00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,270
really all we wanted to do was make a

00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:13,170
robot that people could use with the

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,910
Kinect so why don't we just sort of make

00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,830
this into an open source community

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,990
project which is what we're sort of

00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:23,230
trying to move towards

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:25,990
so this sort of is where we're at right

00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:27,790
now and we're trying to I'm currently

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:30,640
facing this problem of all right if I

00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:32,590
want to make a community project how do

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,380
I instead of just sort of statically

00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,330
saying here's all the designs get people

00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,950
to continuously sort of give feedback

00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:44,740
and maybe even helped change the project

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,210
and so if we're to operate like open

00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,880
source software we'd have to be putting

00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,760
out updates so I'm kind of open to ideas

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,560
about this but one ideas as kicking

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,360
around is what if you had sort of like a

00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:00,730
subscription service people can buy into

00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,650
getting updates so you know one on one

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,920
month you might send out new encoders

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,960
that you had developed and that's that's

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,520
sort of an idea but I'm willing to

00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,510
discuss other with things with people

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,510
thank you very much

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:52,070
so how many people have suffered from

00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:55,040
poor time synchronization yeah okay so

00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,830
this is sort of a diagram of something

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,600
that I did when I built that robot if

00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,400
you saw a Ross Java talk the one that

00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,800
runs with the three laser scanner well

00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,530
the very cheap 2d laser scanner that

00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,470
tilts so we found that there are some

00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:12,490
problems in the basic algorithm for time

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,480
synchronization on who kuya lasers and

00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,850
basically the problem is is that the

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,800
uptime of the laser although it

00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,930
increases consistently it increases at a

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,600
different rate than you know the uptime

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,520
of your host PC and so in order to

00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,630
actually get good time synchronization

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,780
you need to make some sort of estimate

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,950
of that rate of increase and you also

00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,440
need to like keep this up to date

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,660
because since you're communicating over

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,640
USB there can be all sorts of different

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,080
lag characteristics depending on when

00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,790
you actually did this so that little

00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,240
blue window there sort of illustrates

00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:46,490
the the time in which you like request

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,620
the uptime from the laser and then it

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,880
actually the follow the arrow and it

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,860
actually gets to the laser and then the

00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,690
laser returns the uptime that actually

00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,860
gets back to the host PC and then you

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,170
can actually do something like they do

00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,980
with ntp and you can sort of assume that

00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,850
the round the round trip time are the

00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,310
communication to the laser took about as

00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,770
long as to come back and then you kind

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:09,020
of figure out what time it was on your

00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,460
host pc when the up you know for the

00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,470
uptime at the laser that the laser

00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,850
returned and then you can over time

00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,190
actually kind of come up with an

00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,540
estimate of how much quickly the are how

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,740
much more quickly the clock on the laser

00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,320
is running then the clock on your host

00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:22,850
pc and then the nice thing is is because

00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,520
you're creating this model you can

00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:26,660
actually compare the the time you can

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,190
make an estimate of what the time will

00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,110
be on the laser and then compare that to

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,910
what you would have guessed and then get

00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:34,610
a measurement of actually how far off

00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:37,760
you are from the lasers time sync or the

00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,510
lasers clock so with this algorithm we

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,210
were actually able to get

00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:45,350
sub-millisecond time synchronization and

00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,630
with the with the the normal algorithm

00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,970
that we lifted from the standard huku

00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:52,580
you knowed it just didn't work actually

00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:55,270
it was really bad on entry so that's it

00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,270
thanks

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,039
so you can actually get access to that

00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:19,089
it's called a remote up time clock in

00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:21,489
ross drama hi I'm Patrick mihelic at

00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:24,670
Willow I've worked on the image pipeline

00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:30,039
in which transport algorithms for opencv

00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:31,359
PCL and the Kinect drivers and when

00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:33,309
you're working with messages that

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:35,079
contain things like images and point

00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:37,539
clouds the problem is that they're

00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,700
really big so if you have a bunch of

00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:42,009
nodes that are passing these things back

00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,920
and forth you end up spending a lot of

00:40:42,009 --> 00:40:47,619
time doing the serialization and shoving

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,420
data through pipes and that can turn

00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:51,339
into a bottleneck so one solution to

00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,930
that is to use node 'let's which are

00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,900
basically plugins you load them all up

00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,700
into the same node process and when they

00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,229
pass data between each other it's zero

00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:03,819
copy you're just passing a pointer

00:40:59,229 --> 00:41:05,440
around so four nodes when you want to

00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:09,910
load up a bunch of notes together use a

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,920
launch file so here let's say you want a

00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,519
note that does D bearing and know that

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,749
takes that debate image and rectifies it

00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:19,150
you have a launch file that loads up a

00:41:16,749 --> 00:41:21,519
couple of nodes can do remapping and

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,219
assign parameters and all of that if you

00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,719
want to do this with node 'let's you do

00:41:24,219 --> 00:41:28,839
the same kind of thing you can use a

00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:32,459
launch file in this case you have to add

00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:34,959
a manager node which basically

00:41:32,459 --> 00:41:37,239
advertises some services so that you can

00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:40,449
tell it load this nope no delight with

00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:42,039
this configuration and then each node

00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:44,589
gets replaced with a node let loader

00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,449
which is a very thin little thing that

00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:50,799
just causes service on the manager

00:41:46,449 --> 00:41:52,959
telling it to what to load up so there's

00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:56,229
some some more tricks to doing this well

00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:57,819
which I'm going to quickly show you one

00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:59,289
is that if you want to compose these

00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:02,109
kinds of files you should start the

00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:04,029
manager separately so you only have one

00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:05,469
manager and potentially a much of a

00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:09,999
bunch of launch files that you want to

00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:11,920
load into the same process so you can

00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:14,750
give the launch fell an argument for

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,450
what the name of the manager know it is

00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,360
if you want this to be robust it's a

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:23,080
little bit tricky one no delight if it

00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:28,520
crashes brings down the entire process

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:31,160
okay so what you do is you do some

00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,370
arguments where basically the manager

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,070
fails it'll respond itself if you've

00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:41,470
told it to and break bonds with all the

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:44,690
node loaders which will then also stop

00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:48,080
respawn and reload all the nodes with

00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:51,260
hopefully the same configuration this is

00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,960
from stereo image proc basically you can

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,430
include launch files this is including

00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,070
the same launch file for the left and

00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:00,670
the right cameras so these things

00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:03,350
actually compose pretty nicely and you

00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:09,580
can also to debug them you can launch

00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:09,580
the manager in gdb so

00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:33,080
so we have one more talk hello my name

00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,550
is life gentofte I work with Rob how at

00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,530
the by robotics lab at Harvard

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,880
University this is project I worked on

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,220
with Jaroslav Tenzer in the audience

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,380
here those of you who work with robotic

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,840
grasping know that there's nothing like

00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,210
the kinect for tactile sensing existing

00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,250
tactile sensors tend to be expensive

00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,680
tend to be rather fragile is very hard

00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:54,320
to build we've created a tactile sensor

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,210
based on the MEMS barometer cast

00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,370
underneath rubber that's sensitive down

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,260
to five grams buy it for a buck from did

00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,330
Jackie and you can build an array out of

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:05,240
them using standard commercial PCV

00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:07,540
processes we've released an open source

00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,770
plan on our website that you can access

00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,410
still ironing out a couple of details on

00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:14,360
it but this will mean that anyone that

00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:16,820
wants to have cheap effective tactile

00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,290
sensing download the plan you can trim

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,020
it to size if it matches your

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:22,220
application modified if you want

00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,790
commercial non commercial applications

00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:28,480
and it's strong hit it with a hammer but

00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:31,250
25 pounds on it doesn't matter and

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,050
delivers cheap effective tactile sensing

00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:36,110
at a hundred Hertz if you're interested

00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:38,660
talk to us tomorrow we've got a live

00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:41,680
demo and also cards for the contact

00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,680
information thanks

00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:57,140
alright so it is Barron's next time so

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,720
so they're still setting up but first we

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,580
want to thank Matt Renoir's engineering

00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,870
center because the the beer it is the

00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:11,460
beer and snacks outside are courtesy of

00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:13,250
them so thank you very much and thank

00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,060
you to all of our ross con sponsors and

00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:17,240
thanks for an awesome first day of

00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,240
