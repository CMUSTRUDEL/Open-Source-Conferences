so next up we have bill smart who's

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:07,319
going to share with us his experiences

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,200
in teaching robotics with Ross on a Mac

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,420
newbie so been told us how to measure

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,160
great code and bad code let's talk about

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,779
how to generate bad code and that's

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,699
mostly undergraduates so just to be

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,310
clear I'm going to use the word students

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,350
a lot during this top when I say

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,300
students I mean undergraduate students

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,130
or masters students or page stations in

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,960
my class I don't mean my graduate

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:37,020
students who are actually awesome so

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,780
after a couple of days of really good

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,129
technical talks I want to self help

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,110
close out the conference a little bit

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,629
with just some rambling anecdotes about

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,700
teaching with Ross I've been teaching

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,020
with Ross for a few years now and we've

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,570
made some observations in the past we've

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,379
done from the first is why should we

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,930
care about teaching with Ross um and it

00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,300
is kind of a hard sell the the reason

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,859
i'm going to give you is eventually

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,229
there are companies are going to want to

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,540
hire ross programmers and those

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,740
programmers are not going to be

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,630
self-taught probably they're going to be

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,880
taught ross in a university environment

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,930
or college environment or online and so

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,080
we really need to think if we want to

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,520
get Ross into the commercial world with

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,400
people who know how to use it we have to

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,750
start teaching people how to do it and

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,780
so this is actually from the Washington

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,900
University graduation last year our fine

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,579
fine students got their jobs uh-huh um

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,799
so why teach Ross we should all know

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:40,710
Ross that's a given but white t-shirt

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:45,060
Ross so sure hands who knows Ross all

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:50,970
right hands high high high who learned

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:55,860
Ross in a class look around you that's

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:59,460
one of my stiffness um so the thing I've

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,880
come to realize is that you guys are

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:06,950
awesome okay you're at the very end of

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,950
some bell-shaped curve of awesomeness

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,110
you learned Ross from the wiki which is

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:12,250
awesome you learned it from your

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,960
colleagues you learned it by asking

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,490
questions it wound up by going out and

00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,440
grabbing that knowledge and ripping it

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,280
out of the the web and stuffing in your

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,110
head most students are not at the skin

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,900
the end of the curve okay and so when we

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:29,290
took when we teach students we have to

00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,970
teach students who are here right we

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,070
want to it we want to think about how to

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:38,260
get Ross in people's heads without them

00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:40,570
having to be awesome first okay so to

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,850
give you some context I'm currently for

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,920
the next two weeks Washington University

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,680
in st. Louis it's a pretty good root

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,989
university as far as US universities go

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,670
we're ranked number 14th in the country

00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:54,790
right now so the context is not that

00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,770
we're at some place where the students

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,530
are stupid our students are very good

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,830
are very talented and very applied it's

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,270
not at this Washington and it's not this

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,360
Washington it's unfortunately at the

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:11,560
Washington in st. Louis which is right

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:19,470
in the middle I'm moving to Oregon in

00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:22,570
two weeks yay I'm happy if you're not um

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,519
I've taught to I teach two classes there

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,709
are more robots in advance my whole

00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,870
robot the mobile robots class is an

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,160
intro class it's it's like a number of

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,489
other such classes I've taught it about

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,829
ten times over the years I've taught the

00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,530
advanced class about five times over the

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,790
years I tried to count out the number to

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,190
count up the number of students probably

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,310
about 400 over 12 years and so the class

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,570
is evolved mostly computer science but

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,250
especially in the early years we got

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,450
mechanical engineers electrical

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,900
engineers physicists psychologists some

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,329
business major sometimes when we started

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,989
teaching at twelve years ago we use the

00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:04,600
Handy board it's fantastic 6011 based

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:07,329
microprocessor and one use that are the

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,010
gray p hurts and a whole pile of Lego

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:10,180
you build the robot you stick a handy

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,910
board on top of it and it runs around

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,840
very simple sensors bump sensors I our

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:20,200
proximity sensors then we graduated to

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,360
video designs erratic robot

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,630
I think it's called erratic for a reason

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,100
and player and stage initially for a

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,670
year or two and that worked out really

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,790
well the the nice thing about the

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:36,520
erratic are that there are proper robots

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:40,570
they're not LEGO robots player and stage

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,220
gave us a lot of ability to do more

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,050
advanced work and to do it in simulation

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,700
first and then eventually we eased into

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,580
box turtle in the early days of box

00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,250
turtle anyone use box turtle all right

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,540
there the Greybeards right I have

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,870
something to say by Bach startling a

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,490
little bit and more recently in past

00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,270
couple years we've moved on to total

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,880
watts and Diamondback not electric

00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,600
because we chose a stable release one

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,900
when we started developing the course

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,120
and this semester I let some of the

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,320
students in the advanced class work with

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,030
the right track but work on my PR to arm

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,280
which is sort of a brave decision if you

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,860
see what my students do to my robot I've

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,870
got something to say about that too the

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:28,360
the story behind all of this is that

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,010
going through the years from through

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,330
those different iterations of robots and

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:35,920
controllers they get more capable okay

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,900
the turtle bar is a fantastic platform

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,470
when you can when you compare it to a

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,090
6811 processor on a bunch of Lego the

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,040
sensors are much better it can do much

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,060
much more things but it's also a lot

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:52,740
more complex okay programming the 6811

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:56,920
was a single thread of simplified see

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,780
doing a closed loop ross is ross right

00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,910
there's a lot of it and it's much more

00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,460
complex so you there's a trade-off here

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:06,190
and park the trade office with shift in

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,370
focus so now Ross is complex enough that

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:10,630
it scares away the philosophy majors

00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,490
okay because you actually have to know a

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,040
bit about computer science to use Ross

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:16,930
effectively even if you don't need to

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,110
know that much the perception is that

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,990
you really do need to know what so

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,640
here's my syllabus anyone who's ever

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,470
taken robot class will have taken the

00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,560
syllabus it's pretty straightforward um

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,570
you'll notice that it's full of stuff

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,639
it's about 15 weeks I think it's up to

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:37,810
15 weeks and we took

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,580
you know most of the the basic stuff the

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,460
labs from this last iteration were like

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,529
this a lot of zero were the awesome Ross

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,060
tutorials from the wiki which is awesome

00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:52,240
melanie has left the building oh the

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,490
wiki is awesome the first time since

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,009
simulation the shaded half is actually

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,270
on the turtlebot um you'll notice the

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,580
first lab is really straightforward in

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,659
sage get a robot to drive forward and

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:11,759
stop 50 centimeters away from something

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:15,550
okay so how did it go it was awesome

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,129
students love robots simulated robots

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,580
real robots white robots green robots

00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:23,529
they love them all arm I love turtle

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,469
BOTS there's so much better than LEGO

00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:28,210
robots and I have the words to express

00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:32,229
how much better that they are than the

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:34,270
erotics um the sensors are better

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,430
they're cheaper they're more disposable

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,949
um but just they're just better on every

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:43,330
every every account he all should buy 10

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:44,800
arm the labs are more sophisticated with

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,909
the LEGO robots we could do obstacle

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,430
avoidance by bumping into stuff

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:53,500
repeatedly rittenberg vehicles pumping

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:56,199
in and that was fine now when I tell the

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,089
kids about Monte Carlo localization they

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,719
can do monte carlo localization in the

00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:02,620
labs and that's really good because

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,180
before the labs had a bit of a

00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,860
disconnect we'd be talking about all

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,419
these modern techniques and they would

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,409
be doing obstacle avoidance by bumping

00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:18,339
rounds so that's really good arm so we

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:19,629
win and we fail to the students are my

00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:20,710
students are really good and it's going

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:23,110
to sound like I'm being critical of my

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:28,120
students for the rest of the talk and I

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:29,319
suppose I am but they computer science

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,360
students are used to programming

00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,349
computers they're not used to the real

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,479
world so we get them in the simulator to

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,430
drive a robot forward to 50 centimeters

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,229
towards an object and so they're used to

00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,709
efficiency so if you used to fish and

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,910
see what do you do you drive the robot

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,590
forward at 10 meters a second

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,550
you stop it when it's exactly 50

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:56,000
centimeters away from an object anyone

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,110
uncomfortable with that yeah so they do

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,410
that he bring it's through a world you

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:03,260
put it on the turtles and I crash they

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,090
crash in the wall repeatedly because the

00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,560
turtle bots have physics right they're

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:09,440
subject to inertia and all that other

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,850
stuff um so they don't know how to deal

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,100
with that they don't know how to debug

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,510
that especially it's a different kind of

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,880
debugging it's not code to debugging the

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,690
code is correct but there's a behavioral

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,590
debugging and they have a lot of

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,930
problems with that um my students

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,590
although they are often seniors and grad

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:30,320
students are unaware that spewing all of

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,780
the output from a kinect sensor across a

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,330
wireless network when 10 of your friends

00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:42,170
are doing the same thing slows it down

00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:43,460
who would have thought um does anyone

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:48,050
familiar with the first cargo cult

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,310
programming so you can leave them look

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,840
up the story behind it but basically

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,210
what that means is if you don't know how

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,010
to write some code you got the web and

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,780
you pluck a piece of code that someone

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,760
says does the right thing and you stick

00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,620
it on your robot and run you don't

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,620
understand how it works then once it's

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,700
kind of like tf2 me you stick on the

00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,110
robot it kind of works in comes as a

00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,300
demo but when it fails you have no

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,230
insight as to why it fails i found my

00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,740
students doing that more and more

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,710
because a lot of code on the web there's

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,680
a lot of ross code on the web and they

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:21,890
don't understand the code so well that

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,270
they can write it themselves so call

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,860
that Phil debugging tools they don't

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,720
know how to use arvest they don't

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,330
they're not used to using gdb even

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,740
debuggers even so using the the suite of

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:34,730
tools that come with Ross is really hard

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,910
for them yes conceptually um I got it

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,640
wrong all my labs are already

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,690
implemented somewhere in Ross that's

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,690
that's that's tricky

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:54,029
box turtle changed its API once every

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:55,560
five seconds um it's it's hard right

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,060
because I since with high school how'd

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
you do this and I said well the API is

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,660
this and before I finish the sentence

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,079
they changed it not led to some

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,649
consternation my words your assignments

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,730
are one of my labs used to be

00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:10,950
implementation Monte Carlo localization

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,820
and it was worth quite a lot of point

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,890
twenty percent lab grade or something

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:19,920
the last time I ran it and it said used

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:22,140
Ross use as much of Ross as you can see

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,440
what it's going right one student handed

00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,180
in a single lunch file and there was no

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,810
way that I could not give them full

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:36,060
points this right um it's hard man linux

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,070
is hard students don't know linux don't

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,570
know linux you're kind of screwed they

00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,950
don't know bash they don't know what an

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:43,140
environment variable is and they can

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,670
learn all this stuff but you've got to

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,329
put it into that 15-week block and

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,670
something has to come out um they're on

00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,930
some crazy version of Linux in my

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,600
teaching labs and I'm not allowed to

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:59,550
suggest they do otherwise we spent three

00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:03,649
weeks building Ross for that I have no

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:06,600
control over the graphics cards arm I

00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:08,130
have to get the central networking guys

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,350
at the University to punch holes in a

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,899
firewall for me that's a weak response

00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,660
time and it seems to reset itself every

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,579
three days um my students are just

00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,770
unused to plugging things in total box

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:24,420
at the end the day plug them in doesn't

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:26,190
seem like it would be hard they love

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,260
robots but you don't understand it um my

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,390
wife teaches computer graphics and one

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,100
of my advisees was taking her class and

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:36,779
they said I asked them how did it go and

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,070
he said well you know I have really

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:39,660
loved computer graphics I thought I

00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:44,149
would really enjoy the class but you

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:46,829
know it's just hard math and programming

00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:48,120
and people have that with robots to it's

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,320
like these things are awesome you see

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,399
the videos you see the blog videos um

00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,430
underneath that is just solving

00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,800
equations and writing code

00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,510
okay and that realization is not one

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,370
that most under tragedy is have when

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:06,230
they watch the quadrotor videos from

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:09,440
upenn arm then Oh Matthew make our

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,300
students take math but getting reuse it

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:18,140
is kind of hard that's not specific to

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:22,910
Ross obviously but um ah it's hard to

00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:24,350
debug robots so the turtle box running

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,209
towards the wall they have a they have a

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:30,589
second problem with the turtle wants

00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:32,300
even if they do it slowly the range the

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,970
the smallest range on the Kinect is

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,250
about 50 centimeters and so if you don't

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,870
stop a little bit early you get closer

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:45,620
than 50 centimeters and the kinect

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:47,930
returns any 10 11 meters so if you just

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,080
miss hitting the wall you then

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,310
accelerate like mad too into it because

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,740
we've talked about proportional control

00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,680
um but they came to me and said oh the

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,790
turtle Bart's broken okay because they

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,950
didn't know the failure modes um and

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,570
this is all related to the first one you

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,180
see all these awesome videos of Ross and

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,589
robots and it's actually quite a hard

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,589
thing to realize for the students to

00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:14,720
realize that they won't be those awesome

00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:16,370
videos out of this class you don't do

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,950
some interesting stuff but they're not

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,650
going to be featured on on the wiki on

00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,920
the blog um so practically what can we

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,300
do if you're going to do a class think

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,480
about the infrastructure in advance talk

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,120
to your administrators that takes months

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,010
to do arm don't let them install on

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,140
their own laptops I had a student missed

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,670
the first two lab assignments and get an

00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,810
f in the class because he was trying to

00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:44,900
install a Ross onto his mac so there's

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,490
two problems with that one the hit took

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,850
him that long and two that he didn't do

00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,290
the assignments on the lab machines um

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,910
make sure you know what's there I have a

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,440
hard time tracking all the packages like

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,420
don't give him the assignment if there's

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,730
a package for it um students don't know

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,899
subversion source code control but you

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,060
can integrate that kind of stuff into

00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:07,370
the class and so ease them into it I use

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,020
subversion as my hand in mechanism right

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,200
I will check out your code and we'll run

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,490
it

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,490
and if it doesn't make I gave you 0

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,310
points most people use Python so as long

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:17,840
as you um manage your expectations

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,510
you're not going to be the blog video

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,430
tomorrow with your live assignment but

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,550
you know you could do some pretty cool

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,130
stuff um everyone wants to use the robot

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,390
on the day the lab is due google

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:34,370
calendar is an awesome thing and videos

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,920
the robots always break we know that

00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,770
right but all the robots always break on

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,840
the day of the demo and so encouraging

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:44,480
to take videos and then use those videos

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,570
in place of a demo none of this is

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,850
rocket science final thoughts Ross is

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,440
awesome and I think it's great for

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,610
teaching because it's modular you can

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,400
give him the whole system have them in

00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,450
place bits really really good arm but

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,710
you got to think about it before you

00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,390
deploy I didn't think about it really

00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,990
hard the first year I did it and it

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,670
didn't go as well you need to know you

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,770
the student needs to learn a lot more

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,840
stuff ideally you should have two or two

00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,670
or three class sequence that starts off

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,080
with learning linux and then learning

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,180
all this other stuff but that's hard to

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,040
do in the university environment I

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,780
finally students aren't like us right

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,880
most of the people in this room are

00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,670
intellectually curious about Ross we go

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,440
there and we were we're keen to learn it

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,450
a lot of students are keen to get an A

00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,410
and those things are those things are

00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:33,320
different and you need to take that into

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:35,840
account and finally um moving your

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,670
robotics class to Ross is hard it's a

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,490
lot of work and things will go better

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,640
and faster if we share the load it's the

00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:45,760
traditional crowdsourcing call arm

00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,740
there's a cig that we started today arm

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,990
for Ross and education and that's

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,540
construed very broadly if you're

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,880
interested it's on the wiki the wiki is

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,530
awesome go and sign up for it there'll

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,400
be a mailing list out soon come with

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,400
that I'll take

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,240
so the question was how how often do

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,189
students continue with Ross after the

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,910
class um if they take the follow-on

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:28,170
class one hundred percent um if they

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:30,160
work in the lab one hundred percent

00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:35,350
other than that it's close to zero i

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,600
think i think most of the season was the

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:39,610
robotics activity at Wash U is in my lab

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,050
and so basically if you stay in the lab

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:46,540
or stay in the class you use it if not

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:49,000
you don't but I'm numb a number of

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,350
people have gone on to other places and

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,060
use Ross a number of students gone under

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,060
will all say I've joined the team though

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,790
that's interesting I'm the PR too scary

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,830
so of the students who could use the pr2

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,750
of all the students in the class about

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:10,570
thirty percent of them chose to actually

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,830
use the pr2 which seems strange to me

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,050
because this is a unique opportunity

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:16,450
some of them chose to use a turtle but

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,900
instead because it was less scary but

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:23,560
there is less just I don't even know on

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,420
what I access it's scary most of the

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,640
students chose to do stuff in simulation

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,970
and then hand it off to someone who

00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,560
would then user on the robot having said

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,240
that one of the teams that did use it

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,740
managed to replicate some work we did a

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,780
few years ago with a robot photographer

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,830
which took us three person years maybe

00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,800
they replicate it as a class project

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,230
with two of them the semester and that's

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,700
mostly because of Ross and TF and all

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,700
the all the Plumbing's already

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:05,550
my graduate student they they pretty

00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,690
much like it fell into two so the

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,310
question was what were the students

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,620
opinions of Ross they fell into two

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,260
modes some thought it was really really

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,570
awesome because there was a lot of stuff

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,580
they could put stuff together quickly

00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:20,130
the other mode was there's a lot of

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,750
stuff and it terrifies me and I've never

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:24,770
dealt with something this big in an

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:28,010
integration problem like this before

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,010
