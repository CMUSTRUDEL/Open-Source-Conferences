Thank You Daniel up next we have Melanie

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,920
wise who many of you know she's uh takes

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,000
care of a lot of the maintenance on the

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,349
Ross wiki so she's going to be here just

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,670
advising everybody on how to make the

00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:32,879
best use of it ok hello everyone i know

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,640
you are excited about the ross wiki

00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:40,499
please everyone you excited all right

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,979
great okay so how many of you have a

00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:46,170
login for the Ross wiki please raise

00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:50,069
your hand okay everyone who doesn't have

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:52,859
their hand up sign up today the wiki is

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:58,069
editable a lot of people forget this

00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:03,629
it's a wiki it's yours own it change it

00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:06,659
login I'm serious I will find you okay

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:14,780
that's good so I want to show you

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:17,730
something so um yeah so we started

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:22,560
really boosting up the wiki and doing

00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:25,920
stuff with it in 2009 Bob and this is MV

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,070
and actually this is probably me ok and

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,130
this is um well that's probably like

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:35,040
five hundred edits in in a week ok and

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,480
that was like the peak the rock star

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,740
challenge man we made the wiki happen ok

00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,860
so today we are here in two thousand and

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:53,460
we get about 40,000 views on the wiki

00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:57,270
and today we only get about 352 edits in

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,320
a week and so this is not much of a rant

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,320
but it's more of a call-out there's a

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,190
lot there we have over 10,000 wiki pages

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,080
in the Ross wiki and there's a lot of

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,299
work to be done and we need Ross users

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,840
to contribute to be excited to get

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:17,189
involved and so you guys have seen this

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,790
saying if you see something say

00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:22,049
something

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,599
I don't think so fix it don't email me

00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,040
like some of you have you're like oh the

00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,950
tutorials are broken Melanie what are

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,689
you going to do about it well what are

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,409
you gonna do about it it's really

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:38,939
important and so oh darn the audio broke

00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:41,909
well in in the background you were

00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,760
supposed to hear the power is yours okay

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:50,790
so really I'm serious take advantage of

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,629
the Ross wiki okay great okay so I'm not

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,400
going to spend too much more time

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,810
ranting I'm just going to get into some

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,099
of the more technical details of the

00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,280
wiki and the tools that we've provided

00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,049
to make it easier one of the things is

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,819
when you go to create packages and

00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,250
stacks in the wiki Ross is a flat

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,829
namespace and so is our wiki so look

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,590
before you collide okay and be specific

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:14,760
about your package name please don't

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,739
make my utils package or fruity pops

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,329
common package because that doesn't

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:20,280
describe all the work that you're doing

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,340
it doesn't put a good name on it and no

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,510
one can find it Ross is about code reuse

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:31,319
don't don't make your code invalid

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:34,260
because it's obscure make it useful make

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:41,819
it findable okay and try not to use

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:44,280
acronyms oh no no no okay oops and if

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,159
you insist on using acronyms please

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,079
document it put relevant keywords in

00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,079
there make it findable make it useful

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,859
also with documentation fill out the

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:59,129
stacker package manifest when someone

00:03:55,859 --> 00:04:01,620
finds your your your package they should

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,109
know what it does you should put it in

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,760
there and don't create a wiki page if

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,409
you're not going to document it because

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,470
they can use raus raus raus browse

00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:13,590
indexes the manifest and the stack xml

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,150
they can get that blurb you know and if

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,070
you just create a wiki page is just one

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,280
of the 10,000 pages that all of us have

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:22,650
to maintain so if you're going to make a

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,560
wiki page put some real documentation in

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,099
it and also we have a style guide for

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,200
the wiki how many of you knew that okay

00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:34,950
that's good that's good to see

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:39,350
if you didn't know that it's there okay

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:43,410
so let me just use TF as an example of

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,330
acronyms and things like that so TF is

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:50,130
probably one of the most powerful tools

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,770
in Ross but until i went and massage the

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:54,390
search engine on Ross no one could find

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,060
it if they typed in transforms

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,880
coordinate systems transformations

00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,570
because it's a two letter acronym that

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,940
is not really searchable but it has

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:11,910
great documentation and even though it

00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,680
this is why don't have acronyms but even

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,810
though it is an acronym it provides a

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,020
lot of great valuable information and

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,110
it's a great tool in Ross so I'm just

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:25,350
warning you but it's still great and

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:30,060
some acronym packages can be great okay

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:33,150
so so in in the Ross wiki we have lots

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,760
of tools to help you be awesome to help

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:38,730
you take some of the burden off of you

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,170
know documentation getting code samples

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,510
writing tutorials and things like that

00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,510
so I'm just going to go over a few of

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,970
the better tools in or the more powerful

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,940
tools in the Ross wiki and there's a

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,580
page called wiki macros to help you

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,600
learn more about these things but just

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,110
going to walk you through the big ones

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,420
so the get tagged code um if you have a

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,370
tutorial code that you want to make

00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,080
available to someone and explain to them

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,420
how it works you can use the get tagged

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,360
code macro to basically fill in the the

00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,670
code block on the wiki page and then

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,640
show the code lines and then allow you

00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:20,880
to break up that code by its tags and

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,000
put interject comments in the wiki page

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,940
so that you can change the code in the

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,740
repository but still have the tags and

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:37,760
so i'm going to show you an example of

00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:37,760
this in it hates me all right

00:06:52,670 --> 00:07:10,050
all right that's weird um okay maybe I

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:13,110
can I like hallucinating all right here

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,230
we go so in the tutorials we use it a

00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:18,630
lot so here you with that one call it

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:22,220
provides the URI for the tutorial code

00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,220
so that someone can go to it immediately

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:35,930
Wow I think I'm doomed yeah

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,150
I hate technology

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:01,100
I'm sorry everyone okay we're gonna

00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,870
we're just going to roll with it I'm

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,630
gonna go back to slideshow and I'm sorry

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,730
I can't show you it live okay so you can

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,370
put tags in your comments basically that

00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,780
you can grab into the wiki and it'll

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,770
show you the code block so you can

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:19,250
describe them the version macro

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,750
basically it allows you to show buttons

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,960
on the wiki page for the different

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,870
versions of or different releases of

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,910
Ross so that makes it really obvious to

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,830
the people using your code if there's

00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,570
different versions available or

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,900
different API documentation for each

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:39,080
revision of the Ross release also if you

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,270
put a release name in the version macro

00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,490
if instead of just leaving it blank it

00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,280
actually pops up this really nice like

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:52,850
new and Diamondback use it it's exciting

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:55,460
I get excited so then we did some black

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,410
voodoo magic on the wakey I don't know

00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:03,010
how I feel about it but it's there and

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:05,210
it's really useful so clear silver is

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,110
kind of a metal language that's out

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:12,140
there it's not well supported but we

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:15,550
decided to use it to create kind of

00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:21,650
parsers for programming in the wiki so

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:25,190
the node API kind of parser allows you

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:27,530
to put in you know your your topic name

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,690
the message type in a description it

00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:32,000
formats it really nicely so everything

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,920
looks uniform across the wiki everyone

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,300
has a good understanding of how things

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,310
should be formatted and does it

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,700
automatically for you so you don't have

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,010
to worry about it and basically when you

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,010
use that parser you give it the location

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,050
of the parser wiki page which allows you

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,390
to actually construct any type of parser

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,060
you want I mean you could come up with

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,520
the my University's awesome parser and

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,410
put it in there and use it to format all

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,380
of your University's pages without

00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,300
having to worry about like willow nerds

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,370
in the background making other voodoo

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,710
macros for you you can make macros

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,490
yourself

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,170
and that also includes templates so you

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,000
guys have probably written tutorials or

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,770
some of you have and we have a tutorial

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,810
template that makes all the tutorials

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,170
look uniform it has linking from

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:24,350
previous tutorials 24 and forward to the

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,540
next tutorial and it shows the

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,440
description and the links and you know

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,990
it makes a nice searchable template for

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,640
you and that actually is also using

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,770
clear solver and we have this macro

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,990
called include the cs template the clear

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,000
soul silver template all i have to do is

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,070
give it the location of the template

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,360
like this is the actual call that's in

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,220
like in the Mickey syntax to to load the

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,500
tutorial template so you can also create

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,370
templates on your own so if you want to

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,800
add new interesting templates do magical

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,740
voodoo I I support you I think it's

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,030
awesome and I think it's good because

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,040
uniformity across the wiki makes it

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,110
easier for our users to engage for new

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,510
users to get involved and feel like they

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:12,080
have an understanding of how the wiki is

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,790
laid out and that they can have a clear

00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,310
understanding of where I should go next

00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,960
what I should do next and this is a

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,100
tutorial like that's that was one of the

00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,630
first thing that we realized is that

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,730
when we were writing tutorials people

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,220
like well is this tutorial is it not a

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,350
tutorial but we made this template to

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,090
make all the tutorials look uniform and

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:33,020
now when you land a tutorial you know if

00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:35,180
you're looking at a tutorial there's

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,330
also the seesaw macro which is really

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,990
useful because it allowed you to toggle

00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,420
content visibility and we use this whole

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,420
time in turtlebot to put in things like

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,030
hey I don't know how to use SSH so the

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,980
user can click on the ssh help link and

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,470
it pops up the code right there in the

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,820
page they're not linked away to some

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,860
place where they can't get back to your

00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,230
tutorial it just shows them immediately

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,210
like this is how you use SSH and I know

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,520
you're like what you have to put in you

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:08,000
have to use us as a TS we actually do

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:10,280
and so this is really helpful and so if

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,160
you're if you're trying to reach out to

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,670
a user on the Ross wiki this can really

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,340
be useful and it allows you to easily

00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,480
give help hidden help and not have to

00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:25,070
expose it to everyone else

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:31,220
like SSH really guys linking linking is

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:33,199
a good link to every place but try not

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,630
to do hard links and so we've provided a

00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,480
couple different linking macros so that

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,570
you can link without actually having the

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,279
full path link to you know the API Docs

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,920
or whatever so you just put the package

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,040
the name for the message the repo the

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,010
package for K forge or for track and if

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,769
you like lurker we also have a lurker

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:59,899
link macro and if and if you do want

00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:04,610
other other types of macros moin-moin

00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:07,130
has a clear documentation process on how

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,290
to write macros and if you say hey I

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,000
have this awesome macro that I wrote and

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:13,100
you put it on Ross users we will

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,199
probably add it to the wiki back end for

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,230
you i will probably log in and be like

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,149
dumped and magically you will have a new

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,850
wiki macro because that's how awesome I

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:25,100
am kista I care about you and I want you

00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,260
to care about my wiki or our wiki I

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:35,389
shouldn't say that it's our wiki it's

00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:37,190
all yours take it and so lastly one of

00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:41,360
the things I've been trying to do to

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:44,089
really help people get like to the short

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,740
answer fast is something called Ross

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:47,449
promotions so you may have seen this

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,440
when you search for certain key terms

00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:54,709
like transformation I have little ads

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,420
that are very specific to ross and it's

00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,630
like hey you don't know what you're

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,670
looking for I can help you find it so

00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,529
Google search which is actually the back

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,190
end search for the wiki allows you to

00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:09,649
create promotions based on images or

00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:12,350
packages or stuff like that and if you

00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:14,660
want a Ross promotion there's clear

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,190
documentation on the developers page for

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,230
Google for how to create custom search

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:23,510
promotions and it's an XML format and if

00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,389
you send it to me I'll just add it I'm

00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,699
really that open to promoting different

00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:32,990
packages in Ross and I think it's really

00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:33,800
valuable to shortcut the the hard you

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,649
know

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:39,050
out to finding the good software and

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,930
it's really hard with 10,000 pages and

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,029
so if we can do these little things to

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,970
get people to find the right tools fast

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,880
then we're doing everyone a service in

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:55,070
the community so that's about all I have

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:58,310
I just want to reiterate if you if you

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,399
are new to Ross get involved sign up log

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,140
in to the wiki edit things make things

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,990
better because it's going to take all of

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,029
us as a community to make the wiki

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,029
better ok any questions

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:32,110
what do you mean bots okay okay so the

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:37,270
question was how do the maintainer zuv

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:41,110
the wiki feel about bots we're pretty

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,910
open to automate documentation bots

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,890
generating automated documentation we're

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,500
pretty open to that the thing is is that

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,630
we have to be careful with those scripts

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,640
because I accidentally made a script

00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,060
once that added white space or no

00:15:51,640 --> 00:16:00,850
stripped out white space from wiki pages

00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:01,960
automagically that was not awesome good

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,990
thing you didn't run on too many pages

00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:10,240
but but so we are we're open to it but

00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:14,410
small bugs and I'm good at introducing

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,870
bugs can can cause big problems so but

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,220
if you come up with some to land and you

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,870
can demonstrate that it's going to be

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:29,530
awesome I will be there like yeah let's

00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:32,590
do it David okay yeah so the David's

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,510
question was other wikis have better

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,060
tools or more tools for saying this

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:42,670
section needs editing or maintaining

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:45,100
pages yes we are kind of on an older

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,080
tool for wiki's and I think in general

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,060
we would like to move to a new or wiki

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,180
system it's just think about that

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,130
community effort and when we do decide

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:59,080
it it will be a big community effort and

00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,830
we're getting close to that point any

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,830
other questions

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:11,440
okay the question was if I develop a new

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,040
packager stack how do i set up a ross

00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:18,970
wiki so the the important thing is is

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,430
that if you have a set of packages or

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,410
stacks in a repo and you want to get it

00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,270
indexed on the ross wiki you should

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:27,250
announce it on ross users and it'll get

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,560
added to the indexer there is a caveat

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,680
to that it needs to build it needs to

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,290
build on a regular basis with rostock it

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,290
doesn't help us because if it doesn't

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,200
build because we're not going to fix

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:45,070
your code and it will break the auto

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,200
bild of rostock so make sure that if

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:52,630
you're going to try and get your code

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,400
index that it builds what the question

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,190
is what do you do if you have to if you

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:02,980
need to create more paths from a wiki

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:04,720
page okay say you have a page or a

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,880
tutorial it needs to be indexed in two

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,170
places are shown in two places like into

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,780
tutorial areas so do lock cross-linking

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,820
another thing is desert include macro

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:20,670
and there in the wiki that allows you to

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,670
include content from other places in

00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:27,160
yeah and directly shows it definitely

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,610
check out the wiki macros page it has a

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:35,040
lot of these other more general concepts

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,040
for wikis as well

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,260
