hi everyone I'm ribbon from

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:06,870
intermetallics my colleague Belden and

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,450
I'm going to quickly explain you how we

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,190
made it as easy as possible for everyone

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,980
to use google tango with any rows

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,369
enabled robot so first of all let's

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:21,539
quickly introduce google tango so it's a

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,090
project done by Google and the tangle

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,609
stack provides three main building

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,529
blocks so first of all there's motion

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,740
tracking which is based on visual

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:36,210
inertial Dom tree uses tracked features

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:38,700
in the global shutter fisheye image to

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,570
track the motion of the device through

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,480
space as we all know vio might suffer

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,059
from motion drift from time to time so

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,340
that's why they added a concept called

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,340
aerial learning this area learning

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,070
provides localization maps so that if

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,440
you pop up device in an learned

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,280
environment it immediately knows again

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,199
where its position was in that map and

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,570
as a third thing they added depth

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,780
sensors on the device so you can

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:14,430
actually get point clouds as well next

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,979
to that motion tracking so there are

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,710
several tango platforms out there

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,630
they typically consist of a wide angle

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,350
global shutter camera for motion

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:29,570
tracking a depth camera to produce point

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,030
clouds a color camera and an IMU

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,150
current available tango devices are the

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,990
lulav of up to Pro and recently also

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,280
aces as zenfone AR and next to that are

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,930
new tango platforms coming out including

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,259
USB devices that you could hook up to

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:54,960
any smartphone or even to your Linux

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:57,299
device so to be able to reuse all the

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,880
tango capabilities on Ross we build this

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,969
tangora's trimmer app so it's already

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,950
available on the Play Store for free so

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,500
if you feel free to download it and try

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,910
it if you have a tango enabled device

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,940
the card is fully open source on github

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,710
so anyone which is which would like to

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,410
contribute

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,660
and there are already some tutorials on

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,500
the Roth's wiki if you want to know more

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:25,640
about so quickly what's what is this

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:29,300
help so basically it's a Ross CPP no

00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,270
DLitt so that you can reuse it and

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,950
integrate it in your own application and

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,230
the basic idea is to publish all the

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,810
data from from tango to Ross

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,990
so which means the pose of the device

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,410
the images the point cloud and also the

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,450
meshes and they'll come sigrid which are

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:50,270
generated by the 3d reconstruction API

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,670
way of tango so the knot also provides

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,600
some Ross parameters to configure tango

00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:00,710
and some rad services to handle tango

00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,680
life cycles and tango maps so and around

00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:08,060
this rutz note that there is a rajala

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,000
part which make it possible to make it a

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,150
rough Android application to manage

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,090
noted and so to finish this presentation

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:21,620
we have a small video which shows an

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:24,110
example of integrating this app with

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,470
other existing Ross tools in this case

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,440
the Ross navigation stack so here we use

00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:33,280
a turbot and the tango device mounted on

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,110
it to map the area

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,480
so during mapping will produce a tango

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,290
maps for localization and in a cop and

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:46,370
sigrid from the tango 3d restriction api

00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:49,370
which later we use for global a global

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,070
map for the as input to the navigation

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:55,760
stack so here what you can see the ok

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:59,510
with Sigrid generation and in the end we

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,600
use it for as input yeah as a global map

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:07,760
and also the tango pine-clad

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:10,160
uses for optical vengeance yeah so

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,920
that's an example of how can you can use

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:18,859
tango for your robots so if we have a

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,989
booth with also some good from people

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,630
some people from Google tango and from

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,190
ecumene which helped us make this app so

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,110
if you're interested

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,330
please come visit us at their booth

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,190
thank you

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,190
