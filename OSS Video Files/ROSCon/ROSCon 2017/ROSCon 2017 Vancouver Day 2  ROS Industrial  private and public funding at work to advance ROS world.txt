thanks Ryan great to be here yet another

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,440
year to brief you on how our cinder

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,090
still is doing so first of all lots of

00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,549
people still ask we're in Daschle we

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,949
have roughs isn't that enough well Russ

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,470
is doing a great job for roboticist but

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,699
many people in many organizations around

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,769
the world don't know about it especially

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,660
when you work in these environments

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,849
which are still largely dominated by

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,210
PLC's and Windows boxes the big extent

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,160
right so our first goal is outreach tell

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,649
them hey there is this great open source

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,630
software stack that you can use to

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,809
improve the situation for your robotics

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,239
and automation tasks right and after we

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,010
do the outreach there still need for

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,350
further actions from technical

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,640
development to training provide them and

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,520
with informations that there may be no

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,170
technical but still essential to run a

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,870
business out of open sewers

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,930
lots such as legal information and to

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,940
develop application pilots see Russia

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,570
industrial is an initiative which has a

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,670
big part as free and open like Ross the

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,430
Rossy community we have community

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,880
meetings online we have our own github

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,590
organization and again the tools and

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,500
instruments and community dynamics that

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,890
are probably largely used - thanks to

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,659
Ross work larger this the same way but

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,610
now we also have free regional consortia

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,090
that provide managerial and financial

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,369
backing to actually help us with those

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,920
activities that I mentioned as light ago

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,079
I think it's important that the

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,310
initiative is stewarded by no prophet

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,170
apply research institutions since we

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,820
possibly position this framework as a

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,470
vendor neutral Hardware independent

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,600
framework so it's also nice that

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,790
although we seek active participation

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,369
from entities with a commercial interest

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,009
we drive it so to speak we steward it

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,899
from this kind of a notice and I would

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,840
like to thank with this hour more than

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,270
50 members worldwide and among them you

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,880
could see and users of automation from

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,369
heavy manufacturing to other sort of

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,740
applications to OEMs and providers of

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,420
robotics and automation hardware to

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,220
technology providers so system

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,690
integrators also other Applied Research

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,940
Institute's

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,820
universities which see these as a way to

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,230
package their competences in components

00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,050
that can be put to use in the

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,920
aforementioned scenarios now I'll give

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,780
you just a sneak peek at some highlights

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520
from the activities that's going on in

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,180
Europe to then pass it down to my

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,670
colleagues so we are happy to report

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,860
that we had a big chunk of public money

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,380
from the EU Commission for a project

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,260
called Rosen which is coordinated by the

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,170
Delft University of Technology so in a

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,320
nutshell we're trying to improve Ross

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,850
and Ross I on Crete in three aspects

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,800
make it better in terms of software

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,630
quality actually my colleague from the

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,480
80 university of copenhagen adam alam ii

00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,580
gave a talk yesterday and has a poster

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,400
you're welcome to reach out to him in

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,500
terms of how we're planning on doing it

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,550
then you have a part that might be of

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,900
interest to all of you who are

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:12,300
associated with a legal entity with a

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,880
seat in the U which is a public support

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,010
for FTPS and then we are also improving

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,950
our activities and education in terms of

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,239
making them now more accessible also for

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,790
industry professionals who do not

00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,130
necessarily have in academic or linux

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,080
background if you wish and to again have

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,780
them more geographically distributed as

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,820
well throughout Europe again rose in

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,870
their project to you to figure out how

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,930
you can get support for FTP and for

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,310
those of you who are with afraid of all

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,860
the reporting that is difficult

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,840
necessary for you projects we are taking

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,820
most of the pain on your behalf so

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,220
there's a very easy lump sum cost

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,590
calculation so again it's it's easy to

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,810
apply please do another thing that I'm

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,260
very happy to report on is that we're

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,810
pushing also terms of end users in

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,910
manufacturing in Europe as well we work

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,709
this summer with the R&D department of

00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,980
Airbus which has been developing for

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,989
quite some time i Ross tools for mobile

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,269
manipulation your mobile collaboration

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,269
actually that's a pilot that they have

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,010
and screwing the floor of an a350

00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:19,230
airplane and that is now moving from

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,169
their R&D to their manufacturing sites

00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,120
and interestingly they see Ross as

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,069
vendor-neutral transfer medium who is to

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,780
transfer the results and actually

00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,060
actively on the outlook for us capable

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,080
system integrators so I truly think that

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,060
this is what we learnt Altima to drive

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,580
OMS into providing Ross native hardware

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,090
right since it's the users typically

00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:44,129
drive the market before passing on

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,680
save-the-date we have the annual Ross I

00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:49,379
conference under my name stood guard as

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,770
usual will be December 12 to 14th there

00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,719
are some highlight speakers the program

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,789
registration League as last year will be

00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:59,039
available after roschin and iris since I

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,169
typically fish some interesting speakers

00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,000
at those events as well sir

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,779
welcome to hit refresh Ross and Rachel

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,250
dot org and on October 5 the fifth

00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:12,000
registration Lincoln program thanks and

00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:18,180
now on to Matt Robinson from Southwest

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,090
Research thank you hello my name is Matt

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,909
Robinson I'm now the steward of the

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:26,669
rostral consortium America's recently a

00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:28,979
new to Southwest Research Institute and

00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:32,310
my first Roskam because I previously was

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:34,469
at caterpillar where I ran manufacturing

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,330
automation research and we were actively

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:40,199
developing Ross applications for our

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,180
caterpillar factories worldwide but I

00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,279
had this opportunity to move over and

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,770
take over Ross industrial Americas and

00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,599
because we realized the value and the

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,110
opportunity here and we can make an

00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:53,969
impact and how we manufacture so what's

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,740
going on relative to Ross industrial

00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:58,020
America's on the consortium

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,210
we've had some growth I list here kind

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,400
of officially the new the new members we

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,500
have magna which is a largest Tier one

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,150
on a motive manufacturer they're

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,509
actively engaged in the consortium now

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,969
we welcome them in fact they're Stewart

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,080
and advanced robotics is is here was

00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,509
here at the conference and many of you

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,069
may have met him and Cognex also you

00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,680
know Mirko touched on a lot of the

00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,909
hardware providers engaging with the

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,159
Ross industrial and Ross industrial

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:24,719
consortium and Cognex is one because

00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,319
they see an appeal to make their

00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,689
hardware

00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,669
you know interface and be able to

00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,719
function within the Ross ecosystem and

00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,979
that's a great example as far as also

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,740
recently some whenever you may be aware

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,389
of

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,300
but the newest manufacturing innovation

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:41,590
Institute has recently announced it's

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,349
called the arm Institute advanced

00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,930
robotics for manufacturing that's a

00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:49,030
really exciting development and Ross is

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,650
being very well positioned to be really

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,060
the de-facto development framework for

00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,460
the new capabilities it'll probably come

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,800
out of this the other interesting aspect

00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,419
of that is not only as an application

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,150
the applications are centered around

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,009
manufacturing but also then of course

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,500
the benefit is the government matching

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:09,509
funds much like our friends over in the

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:11,830
EU this would be a well well received

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,110
injection of funding to support

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,599
applications developments as far as

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,039
education we've recently released and

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,810
they're out there available on github in

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:22,090
the Ross industrial repo the kinetic

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,370
training we are actually getting ready

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:27,400
to host a new training we've done a few

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,949
classes already recently did one in

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,870
Singapore and also hosted a class in

00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,099
June or the kinetic training it's been

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,770
fairly well received and it's out there

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,210
and available largely on technical front

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,009
and that's what the pictures are here on

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,509
the slide is the focus technical project

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:44,740
we recently wrapped up robotic blending

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,820
milestone for we were very very very

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,320
fortunate that we've been able to

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,030
actually continue this through four

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,130
milestones and considering them fifth

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,229
milestone but largely what we're looking

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,610
here is improving the sensor up to this

00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:57,250
point we'd been using the Microsoft

00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,219
Kinect it's a very low cost and easy to

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,270
access sensor but it had its limitations

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:02,860
so we had the benefit of leveraging the

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,960
incentive and 35 and integration

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,000
integrating that tool for the capability

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,639
development with that we are also able

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,409
to do improve segmentation so that being

00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,020
we were able to actually then create

00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,490
meshes of perceived parts and generate

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,469
trajectories based on that and that

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,139
include curved surfaces where before we

00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:22,449
were just doing planes obviously then

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,740
the next step was to incorporate some

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:25,120
Quality Assurance because this is a

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,710
manufacturing we're making parts the

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,770
intent was hey they're good

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,659
so we integrated Quality Assurance and

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,370
finally I included here that where the

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,539
package is at it's a godel and we

00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,969
actually have a demonstration at our

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,919
booth that is sometimes working maybe if

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,719
you may have walked by and seen it but

00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,760
that that is available out there we're

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,709
currently doing some merging so keep an

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,230
eye on it we'll be available and finally

00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,440
myself the new construction manager

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,230
again recently

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,180
around Memorial Day down started up at

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,100
Southwest Research Institute and still

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,980
kind of adjusting to this role so bear

00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,930
with me I did want to include this is

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,180
kind of the official unveiling of the

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,110
robotic blending milestone video and it

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,150
just highlights some of the capabilities

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,130
we recently did the development or this

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,750
technology demonstration at Wolff

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:11,090
robotics they're based out of Fort

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,190
Collins Colorado the interesting thing

00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,510
about why we chose wolf robotics one is

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,820
that they do a lot of advanced

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,410
development for heavy manufacturing as

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,430
far as like at least in advance in the

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:24,110
context of what you see in factories and

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,510
it's also relevant to a lot of the

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,830
customer or membership base a company

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,450
they work with we've been really trying

00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,220
to engage this idea of the integrator

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,260
being engaged in Ross industrial because

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,330
it's a rapid pathway or an easily an

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,250
accessible pathway to get advanced

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,740
robotics cat' capability in factory

00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,900
floors which is meaningful to a lot of

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,080
companies that don't really have you

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,040
know a development bench in-house that

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,440
was even a challenge in caterpillar

00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,690
right beyond like our corporate research

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,220
group at the plants at these factory

00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,960
sites we want to deploy in leverages

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,640
capability they don't have the bandwidth

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,390
to kind of develop these applications

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,000
from scratch

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,800
so having if you will a one throat to

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,870
choke that's actually going to deploy

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,220
this solution and actually maintain it

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,860
in these factories is very meaningful to

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,460
our end users so here you know we're

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,620
processing these parts integrated QA

00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,900
leveraging the segmentation to basically

00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,940
again further the efficiency of the

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,100
product production as well as improved

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,760
worker safety and allowing those workers

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,350
to focus on more value-added activities

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,210
this is an example of the integrated

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,410
Quality Assurance what's interesting

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,420
here and we do the Quality Assurance

00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,180
right we're actually getting really

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,220
detailed characterization of the part

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,050
that remains to be cleaned up and that's

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,390
meaningful here because then we can

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,130
leverage processing IP again one of our

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,080
consortium members 3m has a lot of

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,640
experience and embracive and so we're

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,460
able to generate more optimized path

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,220
plans to that process and treat these

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,320
materials I'll go ahead and advance

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:55,940
after kind of see the output of the

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Quality Assurance this full video will

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,770
be available up here on YouTube you can

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,540
find it via Ross industrial org there we

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,800
go

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,240
so finally again I touched on this as

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,439
the value of the integrator right so

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,000
these integrators typically stitched

00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:09,319
together a bunch of hardware and deploy

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,550
these solutions and support them in

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:12,230
factories and I can't highlight the

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,329
importance to at least our end users on

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,730
that support piece because I know a

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,290
number of us at Southwest or when I was

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,370
at caterpillar in corporate research I'm

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,410
not the one who's gonna answer the phone

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,639
at 3:00 a.m. when it breaks right so

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,649
it's really convenient to have that

00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,319
deployment vehicle so we start realizing

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,180
the value sooner right along the way and

00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,529
writing facilitates a stepping-stone to

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,629
realize the greater objectives that we

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,579
all talk about as far as a future state

00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:36,620
then lastly I just wanna touch on a few

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,660
upcoming events we're hosting a training

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,790
at caterpillar caterpillar is so excited

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,470
with the progress we've made both in the

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,970
manufacturing research space and product

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,350
automation space they're actually

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,589
hosting a training event that'll also

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,149
have an advanced rack option go you can

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,160
find more information about that on the

00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:54,139
events tab at Ross industrial work we're

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,240
also hoping down in San Antonio we're

00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,069
hosting a little group we're gonna set

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,660
aside some space and participate in the

00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,699
world move it day so I'm encouraged

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,930
obviously everyone to support and get

00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:05,480
involved with world move it Day on

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,250
October 18th first membership meeting

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,750
for the arm Institute November 1st or

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,279
third so you'll probably start hearing

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,199
some things coming out from that and

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,259
then finally our annual meeting not too

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,759
much after the e use is it's gonna be

00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,290
it's slated late February more

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:20,329
information we coming that as we firm up

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,170
the date but you we usually are in that

00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,870
kind of late February early March

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,910
timeframe so with that being said I'll

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,110
pass over to my colleague middling from

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,110
Ross industrial asia-pacific thank you

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,680
all right thanks Matt so I'm gonna try

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,480
to do this in about five minutes

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,790
okay so what's industrial ap where we

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:44,430
are so far we began our journey one year

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:47,370
ago now in year two our main objective

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,960
is to use vast industrial for when dust

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,170
was industrial for industrial use

00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,420
increase robotic robotic talent in

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,730
ensuring loss is key enabler for

00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,160
students professionals and industries in

00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,680
asia-pacific so we've done workshops

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,420
we've done training we are doing whilst

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,520
industrial awareness in the region as

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,250
well as doing an FTP which we I will

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,930
explain a bit later about pack ml so

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,000
does the picture of our activities we

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,500
had a workshop in Singapore in May

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,170
earlier this year there was about 80

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,820
participants we always invite at NASA to

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,770
come and join and also present

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,770
information about how they use vast in

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,240
Johnson Space Center and also we had a

00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,900
demonstration and workshop and

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,280
presentations so packing all this is um

00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,680
a FTP a collaboration between 3m a RTC

00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,360
Sweden plus one of our bodies so what we

00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,310
were doing here is trying to understand

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,800
software development and create software

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:45,570
to use POC ml which is a packaging

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,180
machine language to using a OPC UA to

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,590
connect to a PLC using loss so there's

00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,930
two different methods of doing this you

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,400
can have vast as the master or the PLC

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,500
as the master and I'll explain a bit

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,410
about that later so what we did was we

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,990
tested it with them at PLC and then see

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,140
see if that works but we also had C++

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,290
libraries and also it in Python using

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,090
smash we also integrate an RV's plugin

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,210
for Packer Mel showing the Pikeville

00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,800
state machine as a simplistic manner and

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,250
then also provided options for mode

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,050
selections in the PLC as well as

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:22,020
accumulative state of each of the states

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:26,030
as you go through the PLC state machine

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:29,970
so quickly on a far left or far

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:32,280
left-hand corner vas industrial robot

00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,800
enoy so then you have PLC so this is

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,900
where we are or where we were before now

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,580
where we are as we connect it was to

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,320
communicate with the PLC's and we can

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,440
communicate with various vendors as long

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,760
as they have OPC UA connectivity so our

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,250
main aim is to able

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,260
as the master to communicate with

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,230
different machines and different PLC's

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,260
so here PLC is sending the master

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,720
signals to boss but what does video is

00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,190
showing is the boss is the master which

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,260
is very interesting because it sends

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,870
signals and messages to the PLC and then

00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,550
the PLC sends messages to KUKA so we're

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,070
really using in this case vast as a

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,959
middleware and it's this is also

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,760
available github so feel free to

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,800
download feel free to contribute feel

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,339
free to um play around with the PAC ml

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,660
state machine so going back to what we

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,790
are and what we're trying to do for

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,399
asia-pacific region we're trying to a

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,529
seller 8 robotic adoption investment in

00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,180
asia-pacific but also support loss

00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:29,760
industrial driver development in this

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,709
region what we are looking into is

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,899
certification for hardware compatibility

00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,310
with vastu and that's something that

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:38,100
we'll look forward to in the next couple

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,510
of years as well we've got hardware

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,100
interfaces software development

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,540
education and training and of course a

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,930
lot of community events and networking

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,880
events so come and visit us at a brief

00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,130
so we're out there in room 220 and

00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,880
here's the contact information and yes

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,880
I've done it in time

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,330
thank you very much

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,310
do we have any questions for what's

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:10,450
happening within the world of Ross

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:12,070
industrial yes house right which PLC

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:15,610
models were you integrating with with

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,200
you a at the moment we're using Siemens

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,120
and Beck Hoff but we're looking at a B

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:24,580
but that's gonna be tricky because of

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:27,060
them where a B is at with OPC UA do you

00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,020
know what's the longest-running

00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:33,310
installation of Ross industrial in a

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:44,320
production environment but I guess these

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:47,410
guys can tell me January 2015 he

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,810
mentioned some ATVs we currently have a

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:51,250
deployment for scanning plan which is

00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,010
basically a framework I showed for the

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:58,090
blending it's been running at Spirit

00:16:54,010 --> 00:17:01,140
AeroSystems doing high mix painting for

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,140
probably about three years now

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,339
all right if there are no other

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,450
questions then we'll thank the speakers

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,680
