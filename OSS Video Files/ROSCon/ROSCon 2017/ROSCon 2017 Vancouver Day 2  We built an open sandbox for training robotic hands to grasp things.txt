okay thanks for the introduction so

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:06,810
today I'm going to talk to you about the

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,530
smart grasping sandbox that we build at

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,370
shadow so first why I'm going to talk to

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,780
you about that

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,359
so this sandbox it's a sandbox build so

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,010
it's a simulation and the idea is that

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,789
when you do grasping when you do

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,800
manipulation robots can be expensive you

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,859
can break your robots as well and having

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,330
simulation is quite nice especially when

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,510
you want to start doing machine learning

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,620
which is quite popular nowadays and this

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,450
talk is not about how we're going to

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,829
disrupt manipulation using machine

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,540
learning or Diplo and you know whatnot

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,000
right so I'm going to show you a few

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,210
example of using the sandbox for machine

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,250
learning but they're not like how do you

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,510
do the best grass quality in machine

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,070
learning or anything like that it's more

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,379
how do you use these sandbox to do

00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:02,280
something useful so we go yet shadow so

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,670
let me let's see some videos I'm sure

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,790
that you might be somehow hungry have to

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:11,640
the video so this is what we do a shadow

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:14,369
right we do very very very good hands we

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,130
also do some software around it in this

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,770
case you are seeing a robot that's

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,710
cooking a recipe this recipe has been

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,799
cooked by a chef so the winner from

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,210
MasterChef 2011 in the UK if you're

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:33,090
familiar with the emission and the idea

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,990
here is that it's kind of like a Pixar

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,240
movie where you were sued you move

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,340
around this we call some data and then

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,229
you replay the data on your robot you

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,810
robot coupe the crap cooks the crab

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,280
bisque and you can eat crab bisque every

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,259
day for the rest of your life which is

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,829
quite neat because it's a very very good

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,500
crab bisque so that's something that we

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,079
did a shadow with that we won the best

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,590
of the best of CES Asia which was a nice

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,750
reward but for me this is not very much

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,670
robotics right this is just automation

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,340
because in the mean time what happened

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,349
before between okay we record the chef

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,490
moving around and we actually do the

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,770
crab bisque we take three months to

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,840
really refine each trajectory we've done

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,580
some software around that as well

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,570
which we've contributed to remove it and

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,330
all the people but what we want to do at

00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,550
Shadow is to take one step further and

00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,550
make grassing smart right so making it

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,340
easy to do this kind of thing right to

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,990
be able to cook with your robot or do

00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:40,250
other things because cooking is maybe a

00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,670
bit so hk's business-wise but the other

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:50,720
business is that can obviously apply in

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:53,960
that case right so what are the uses of

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,450
the smart grasping sandbox right so as I

00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,980
said it's very useful for for machine

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,110
learning so in my presentation we go

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,080
first of all what what's actually in

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,820
this mod Westwind sandbox then two

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,390
different machine learning cases one

00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,490
which is gathering a beam that I said

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,950
using the small grasping sandbox to see

00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:17,150
was a my grasps axe which it usually

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,290
does and the last one will be doing

00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,540
machine learning online to do

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,830
reinforcement learning so using the

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,830
human input

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,970
so first let's see how we can prototype

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,380
machine learning using the small

00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,450
grasping sandbox so just little thing

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,040
about myself so I'm the proud dad of two

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,920
little girls and they really like to

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,840
play in the sand so I thought yeah they

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,490
do lots of things in the sand way one

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,080
time build a nice sandbox for my robot

00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,460
that's very useful right so what do I

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,230
want when I have two girls playing in

00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,120
the sandbox I want a nice environment

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,000
right I want it to be safe I don't want

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,860
them to be get damaged it's more

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,530
important for my girls than my robot but

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,810
it's still important for my robot so

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,250
what a safe environment I also want an

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,380
environment that's that's fun and

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,170
stimulating right so you want obstacle

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:08,180
you want if your robot that as an arm

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:10,400
and a hand you probably want a table

00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:13,640
some obstacles some things to grasp

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,120
right so a few things and that's our

00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:22,580
environment on top of that you want some

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,310
tools to mean you want it to be easy to

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,290
play with in design you want some I

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:31,850
don't know it's going English

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:35,150
a part of something and in robotics you

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,070
want a nice library you want to be able

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,540
to you know reset the environment this

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,970
kind of thing so that you can restore

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,970
from fresh so you want lots of toolings

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,510
you want to be able to plan using move

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,670
it and this kind of thing right and find

00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,080
me like the dream go the dream thing if

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,060
you're a dad and you have two girls

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,440
playing in the in the sand is when you

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,450
want to move you would like to be able

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,820
to tape all these two girls playing in

00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,610
the sand and move them home without them

00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,470
crying on the way in the car right so in

00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,600
robotic dis translate by being a

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,630
headless so you want to for example

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,000
prototype on your laptop you're happy

00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:13,730
it's working now you deploy it in the

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,950
cloud running run it on a machine big

00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,890
machine run it multiple times and get

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,740
your results more quickly so if we add

00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:26,840
all this we get the small rasping

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,970
sandbox so what does it look like so

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:36,730
this is the small rasping sandbox in

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:39,200
action so this is running on my laptop

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,450
later on you will be you will see it

00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,510
running in the clouds we want a bigger

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,180
machine so it's less jerky here it's

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:52,550
running on Mac OS so the good thing is

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,160
that it's always agonistic there are

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,650
multiple features in there the library

00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,290
as I said we have different tools the

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,060
some of the tools are is very simple to

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,550
a high level library that makes it

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,620
possible to plan using movie it to be

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,230
able to pick pick the bow in that case

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,700
to be able to reset the environment I'm

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,560
not sure we can see it here but we will

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,420
see it later on so once you've picked up

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,520
your bow and done something with it you

00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,250
can just reset and it goes back to the

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:24,500
safe position so there are lots of

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:27,860
features right so now let's talk a bit

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,400
about the text that I use to do that so

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,260
on at the bottom I'm using docket when

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,970
capsulate everything and this is very

00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,490
nice you can deploy it anywhere as I

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,500
said you can put type on your laptop

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,960
when you're happy you you can commit you

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,949
own

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,910
push it to the cloud and open it again

00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:50,190
somewhere else that's very handy to have

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:52,620
also I don't know Ricardo is but we've

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,900
done some collaboration with the people

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:58,349
from the construct and it's deployed on

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,569
the Ross development studio so you can

00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:02,610
actually directly spawn it on Ross

00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,530
development studio on their website and

00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,509
have the whole smart who has been

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,789
sandbox they've also done a course

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,610
around it so if you want to learn a bit

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:13,979
about manipulation about grasping you

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,740
can go see them I'm not getting paid to

00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,210
say that sorry but it's actually pretty

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,470
neat because you can really start right

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,400
away you don't need to install anything

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:26,009
on your laptop on top of that you might

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,639
have guessed if I'm here that he's using

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:32,840
Ross it's still on Ross indigo I shoulda

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:38,610
prayed to Ross kinetic at least sorry

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:40,620
somewhere I'm also using gazebo with so

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,370
with gazebo it's very nice because it's

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,930
the out of the box simulation in wrath

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,669
what's not very nice is that for

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,470
manipulation and grasping it's quite

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:52,770
limited it's quite hard to do grasping

00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,240
in gazebo you have lots of issues when

00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,419
you want to grasp so grasping your bow

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,340
is not that easy in gazebo so I'm hoping

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,110
that gazebo evolves I know last here

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,550
traskon Louise gave some talk around

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,889
people and all the improvement they made

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,460
and she was talking a bit about grasping

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,139
and manipulation so there is hope

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,889
another tool that we are using is move

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,539
it so we can plan directly go from A to

00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:22,770
B without hitting anything which is

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:25,500
pretty pretty neat if I need top layer

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,900
of technologies I'm using is a simple

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,090
Jupiter notebook so that you can write

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,300
Python from your browser and you can

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,070
also write nice files so to make

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,709
tutorials or explain your ideas which is

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,140
pretty neat because you can write

00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:41,550
comments and do some markdowns also

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,279
displays things like in your browser

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,620
plots things etc if you want to go a bit

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,890
deeper in the code there's an IDE as

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,280
well I'm nine and I'm also using GZ at

00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:56,520
web for displaying things because

00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,560
again we don't want to pop up we in that

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,960
case before because we want to it to be

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,080
a headless and we want to be able to see

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:10,050
what we're doing while deploying on any

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,380
any kind of computer so that was the

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,090
sandbox right so now the first approach

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,270
we're going to look at is how can I use

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:22,170
this to create the dataset a big data

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,330
set around grass quality and how can I

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:29,660
use this grass in this grass quality

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,660
data set to predict my grass quality

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,030
so first let's focus on what does it

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,160
mean yeah III know I was late so I

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,070
thought maybe some fun gifts wouldn't

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,760
make it more lively and it's a very nice

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,190
movie as well so what does it mean for

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,250
grass to be stable right it means that

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,890
whenever I grass grass my object if I

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,670
shake my hand the object does not fall

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:58,950
the object falls my hand right so when

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,510
we gather data set in simulation and

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,060
what we want if we want to it to be

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,339
annotated and automatically right but

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,260
you don't want to spend hours looking at

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,710
each data and saying yes my grass were

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,589
stable or no my grass was not stable you

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,410
want it to be automatically annotated so

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:20,760
this is the objective wrassle stability

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,710
measure I use so it's really simple to

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,930
understand you male you measure the

00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,390
distance between your object and your

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,940
poem if this distance does not die when

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,980
you shake the object you're happy it's

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:39,210
stable if it varies the more it varies

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:43,770
the less stable it is so this is how we

00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:45,810
gather in the data right obviously I'm

00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,420
not shaking the ball in gazebo because

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,150
again grasping in gazebo is quite hard

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,190
so lifting the bow is already quite

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,750
tricky having a grass that's stable

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,910
enough to leave the bow is already quite

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,460
tricky and what we don't see here is

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,650
that whenever you look at the ball it's

00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,089
not really stable actually is rotating

00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,000
in the hand which is quite hard to

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,570
achieve with fixed fingers but again the

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,780
difference

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:14,880
laterz out there and maybe one day we

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:18,600
can have a good grasp in gazebo but so

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,570
how did I get gather enough data I I

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,550
found multiple instances on the server

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,720
because we stalker they are all isolated

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,150
right so you take big VM and then you

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,550
spawn lots of instances doing the same

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,680
thing together at the same time and

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:38,430
gather lots of data so in my case I ran

00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,020
1 million experiments were grasping the

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,740
goal lifting the goal computing the

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,600
metrics rasping it with different

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:48,450
randomized grasp so that I have good

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,020
grass bad grass rasps in the middle and

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,120
I've let that run for few days so the

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,520
important point to get from that is that

00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,410
it's available right you don't have to

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,270
do that because that takes a lot of time

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:05,700
it's bit boring but it's available and

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,100
it's on Kago so I don't know if you're

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,600
familiar with cago which is a machine

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,500
learning platform I think it's owned by

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,080
Google i/o in our days so I approved it

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,240
it took a go a nice side effect to that

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:23,280
is that they are running apparently a

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,740
monthly price on the data sets that are

00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,620
put on their website and they're very

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,370
excited by robotics with robotics data

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,190
set sorry so excited that I won $5,000

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:38,670
for putting this data set on Cagle so if

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:43,920
you want to share data set very nice way

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:47,960
to do that so then okay now i have my

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:51,510
big data set it's annotated right on on

00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,510
for each for each measurement i know

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:56,520
whether the grasp is stable or not and

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,920
now again i'm not going to solve grass

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,570
quality with these data set right we

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,170
were just resting one ball again and

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,180
again so it's not really generate you

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,390
can't read and write that to a lot of

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,480
different objects but the goal is to

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,880
transform our inputs on when I hand the

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,710
inputs are everything that I get from my

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,270
robot in that case I didn't put any

00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:22,570
tactile sensors just to make it

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:25,660
a bit more fun I'm just using talk and

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,500
velocity measurements for each joint in

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,530
the middle you have some black magic or

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:37,810
you'll network for example and on the

00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:39,340
left you have whether your grass is

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,290
stable or not right so you have your

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,120
left you're on your last neuron which is

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,490
is it stable or not so some kind of

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,310
measurement of protection about grass

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:54,280
stability so just one word I'm using TRS

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,020
for this on top of tensorflow so very

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,860
nice library we need to use you can

00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,590
prototype very quickly and then I try in

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,530
a very simple neural net with one one

00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:08,340
hidden layer my input layer my output

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:12,880
layer and just trained it for few hours

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:16,390
using Nvidia and that's the life

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,900
prediction so the first one is a stable

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,160
grass you can see on the left in the

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,110
notebook you can see the grass quality

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,540
so it's predicted to be stable it's

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,510
stable and the second one if you look at

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,800
what's happening with the robot here you

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:34,150
think that the ball is going to be

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:36,880
lifted but if you look at the quality

00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:40,480
it's not a good quality so the ball is

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,060
not lifted and that was predicted

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,830
again it's not super impressive because

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,900
it's not generic or anything right I

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,610
grasp this ball 1 million time and now

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:51,100
I'm able to say well so it's going to be

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,020
stable or not not not super impressive

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:55,570
but India like the ID is quite neat

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:58,150
because we can do that we can reset the

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:01,420
simulation etc so it's very very easy in

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:03,820
a way to create this data set it's a few

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,360
lines of Python you create the data that

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,840
you can use it to do other things and

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,430
then I mean there are still a number of

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,860
problems with that I mean then you need

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,770
to grasp objects which is again quite

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,870
tricky you need to be able to transfer

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:27,450
that knowledge to the actual robot which

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:30,190
is probably also quite tricky ok so now

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,780
we're going to look at another way to

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,120
approach machine learning with the small

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,690
glass

00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,480
sandbox and this is doing reinforcement

00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,970
learning and using the sandbox directly

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,040
to reinforce our grasp right so doing

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,440
live reinforcement learning on on the

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,070
sandbox just quick word about

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,930
reinforcement learning so what do you do

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,720
when we do enforcement learning first

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,550
thing is you teach the robot

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,620
so either you krrish shape the hand

00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,960
around your exact or you wear some kind

00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,550
of data glove and and move the robot

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,260
around the object so you have a grasp

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,850
that's good enough if you replay that

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,150
grasp a hundred time you will probably

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,610
fine teen ninety eight times out of 100

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,230
and what you want is to be able to

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,810
succeed every time right so then you

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,930
want some kind of magic process or you

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:23,180
like magic sorry and again you want to

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:27,380
be able to use that so I turn to base an

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,690
optimist optimization the idea behind by

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,900
is an optimization is that you want to

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,240
find your peak and you want to minimize

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,420
the number of samples you use to find

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,240
that peak and then you can you can

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,050
change and balance the way you explore

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,120
or the way you exploit exploit that your

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,250
samples right so you can either focus on

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,350
exploiting samples that means that

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,450
you're going to convert very quickly to

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,310
a peak not knowing whether it's the best

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,350
peak or not or you can focus on

00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,150
exploration and then you will have lot

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,600
more samples that are gathered all

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,370
around the space and you will be less

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,480
precise on your peak but you have more

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:11,569
chances to find a good peak so in our

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:17,620
case we have a multi-dimensional space

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:22,160
right it's not just 2d space but if we

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:24,079
if we start from the human pose then we

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,620
can restrict that space around the grid

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,950
pose that the human is shown and then we

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,980
rounded by is in process and we sample

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:38,380
using the same grass quality that gives

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:42,050
us a measurement and with sorry

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,550
so we sample using the same quality

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,730
measurement and that gives us

00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:49,920
a an objective measurement of our

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,530
stability and we can converge on to our

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:56,130
peak which is the most stable region of

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,780
the grasp right so using this process it

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,360
converge quite quickly which is nice

00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,670
especially since we have a small space

00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:08,760
to to look at and it also generates this

00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:11,700
quite well to the robot because if you

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,290
manage to grasp it in grass in gazebo if

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,050
you manage to grasp this object in

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,690
gazebo since we're just replaying the

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:21,480
position as the target for the real

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,370
robot if your object matches the object

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,470
in simulation quite closely then your

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,190
grass position like your grass targets

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:31,980
are quite well adjusted for this robot

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:36,390
and the grass that we replay on the

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:39,210
robot is actually very stable obviously

00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:40,320
does again a lot more work to be done if

00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,760
you want to use that as a real

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,610
reinforcement learning it's not the

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,980
objective of the talk but again it's a

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,230
nice way to teach people to use

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:57,120
reinforcement learning or to do things

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:59,850
in simulation quickly so this this this

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,410
work was funded through corona project

00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,960
which is a EU project that we run a

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,480
shadow and also to a Satie project which

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:11,160
is another UK well this one is a UK

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,040
funded project sorry so we've looked at

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,440
the sandbox we've seen its advantages

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,850
which OS ii o sticks it's easily easy to

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,770
deploy

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,780
you can already play with it there's a

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,790
nice tool box that makes it possible to

00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,060
play very quickly and and start doing

00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:29,460
things very quickly but there's still

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,820
plenty to do right there's plenty to do

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,160
on the simulation side of things and

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:41,130
contributions are more than welcome so

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:43,190
if you want to give it a go okay thank

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,190
you

00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:56,650
questions what was the what was the

00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,510
dimensionality of your Bayesian

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,049
optimization and what algorithms did you

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:04,660
use to do the optimization so the

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:07,419
dimensionality is nine we have nine

00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:14,830
degrees of freedom and I'm using the by

00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:15,250
in optimization library in Python yeah

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,039
good

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:20,559
can you comment on running the

00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:22,240
simulation at faster than real time did

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,690
you find that possible did you find it

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,150
useful did you try it so it's not

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,830
running faster than real time I couldn't

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,370
make it run faster than real time but I

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:36,640
did then try on a beat like on the

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:39,750
massive computer maybe I mean it would

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,110
be useful obviously well right thank you

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:48,630
all right well thank you go

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:48,630
