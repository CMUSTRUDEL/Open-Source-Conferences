hi my name is ghazan and i'm from

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,080
reputable buttocks before repeated

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,340
robotics I was part of the robot project

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,570
and this was our final demonstration

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:16,590
yeah all those posters are for the

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,940
visual slam guys so what we were

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,270
demonstrating we were able to

00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,699
demonstrate dynamic provision of a multi

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,130
robot system depending on what the

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,050
patient was requesting so the european

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,689
union the funding agency was quite happy

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,960
but after three years I still get

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:39,920
nightmares about this demo so let let me

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,239
say why so first of all we had it was a

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,579
project with different universities so

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,760
we are two weeks before the demo we got

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,469
together in Eindhoven Netherlands with

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,570
all the components and when we try to

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,770
put stuff together all the hell came

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,680
loose so there were many different types

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:00,989
of robots and on top of it we had a

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,220
computing infrastructure in Amazon and a

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,900
bunch of sensors in the environment then

00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,979
managing all the software on top of

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,689
these different heterogeneous

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,970
infrastructure was a challenge we

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,500
eventually had like individuals or

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,250
groups responsible for each

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,770
infrastructure all the communications

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,200
dependent on one single roastmaster so

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,200
you know what will happen and then the

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,710
cloud it was totally out of everyone's

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,200
comfort zone virtualization public

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,140
Internet thinks going down and coming up

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,990
for no apparent reason and then finally

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,600
like the logging and debugging this

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,060
whole heterogeneous system was very

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,770
exhausting

00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,899
finally croquettes I know the Dutch love

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,310
them but every day for two weeks

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,380
that was a bit hard all right so we

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,149
can't do anything about the croquette

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,090
opposition but there is a solution for

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:01,469
rest of the problem the solution is a

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,390
platform so a platform simply simplifies

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,640
or abstracts away a messy problem and

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,229
you can build on top of it so if you

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,780
take away the community aspects of the

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,190
raus raus is also a platform which gives

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,650
you your messaging infrastructure and

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,290
tools to build

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,140
and manage your robotic software so our

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:20,060
platform also complements Ross with a

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,260
couple of services to manage the

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,530
infrastructure that I was mentioning

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,870
previously so for example we have a

00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,900
device management service which you can

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,569
use to manage the software configuration

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,890
of your remote device including

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,980
deployment provisioning orchestration

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,170
onboard software then you can have a

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,930
messaging service which can connect

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,239
remote roster environments and then you

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,560
can have functions such as message

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,510
privatization QoS and security then of

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,310
course unified runtime and many things

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:56,959
that we would like to show in the boot

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,939
if you want to drop by here okay I'm

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,709
here I want to quickly mention like how

00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:02,329
we are eating our own dog food that

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,060
means like how we are using this

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,530
platform to build our own product so the

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,769
hardware said this is the hardware setup

00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,299
which is an autonomous drone system

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,060
where there is no human intervention

00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:16,629
necessary to operation then the platform

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,359
has enabled us to build a distributed

00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:22,699
software across the drone that the

00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:27,500
charging station and the cloud

00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:30,139
infrastructure on top of it we are now

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,659
sharing this software infrastructure

00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:34,669
with domain experts who have no idea

00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:37,549
about robotics but knows everything

00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:39,919
about construction and surveillance so

00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:43,340
these experts can now focus on solving

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,799
their end-user pain points instead of

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,260
worrying the infrastructure so if you

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:51,590
want to build something a services like

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,560
this and scale up and spend less time on

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,340
the infrastructure please do visit us at

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,490
the executables thank you

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,490
