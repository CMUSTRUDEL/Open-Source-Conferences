okay good afternoon

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,790
amita Tita Maya I'm industrial design

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:11,280
engineer from earlier robotics as all of

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,040
you know we are working on a truss the

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,199
hardware robot operating system to offer

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,570
the world and standard models for

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,939
building robots the standardization

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,820
requires that all the details fit like a

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,970
Tetris so I would like to introduce you

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,550
today one of the peak is the information

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,800
model but what is a truce information

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,899
model it is a set of rules and a

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,860
specification to create a standard robot

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,649
modules it roars removed the component

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,329
integration we eliminate the necessary

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,829
effort to achieve communication between

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,250
devices that can be almost the 7% time

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,710
over the total nowadays so if we

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,829
translate all of these tours we need

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,829
that all the modules contain the same

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:05,040
topic message parameters action services

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,720
to make sure that all of them speak the

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,189
same language at all levels and

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:19,229
information model is the document that

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:21,479
describe all of these details we are

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,369
pushing words to get a standardized we

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,780
believe in words but we also believe

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,840
that it needs ISTEP more it needs to get

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,479
the next level of acceptance that's why

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,670
we are working actively with

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,750
international organization like I saw or

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,799
oh ma

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,140
and all of these we need will help us to

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,360
create a solid infrastructure from the

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,600
ground level I'm making a drawers

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,659
information model reference document to

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,360
create a standard robot models thank you

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,299
for your attention and if no one in

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,740
anybody wants to know more about

00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:02,090
information model or a trust information

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,770
model can talk to me thank you

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,870
[Applause]

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,720
thank you very much I know there's one

00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,520
thing the OSR eff approve or appreciates

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,140
more than pull requests and it's other

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,130
people working with the standards body

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,020
so they don't have to alright no offense

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,360
if you're on a standards body all right

00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,210
so we have HMI who we are what are we

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:36,150
doing with John and on deck we have

00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:38,190
Christoph everybody it's a pleasure to

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,400
be here I last time I came to arroz con

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,690
was in 2012 so it's been awesome to see

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,870
the evolution of this community and

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,730
watch how it's grown so real quickly I

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,870
want to give it a little overview of

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,530
what we've been doing or who we are and

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,000
what we're doing so first who we are

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,880
you've seen this before this is Robonaut

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,860
2 a lot of us came from the engineering

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,500
group in at Johnson Space Center in

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,420
Houston then we decided to move out and

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,760
see what we could do in the real world

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,160
interesting quick story about this robot

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,019
I want to share with everybody so you

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,530
know we spent nine months turning a

00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,760
research robot into a ISS payload and

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,040
import our heart and soul into getting

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,870
it up onto the space station and then um

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,130
so you got to kind of imagine you got

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,590
like 30 engineers sitting around

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,150
watching the the live video feed the

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,640
first time they unboxed the robot and

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,769
then they the astronauts open up the box

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,560
and there's no robot inside and we were

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,239
like that was pretty interesting so off

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,459
the off Fida they had taken the robot

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,810
out already and moved off to the side so

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,760
we couldn't see it

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:43,320
those guys are jokesters so we also

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
worked on the Valkyrie robot that you've

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,489
seen a lot of today fantastic robot it's

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,340
done a lot of great things since the DRC

00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,050
as well too so a lot of people have

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,340
asked if you go to our website there's

00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,440
really nothing too descriptive about

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,030
what we're doing so I'm proud to be here

00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,670
today to kind of for the first time

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,880
publicly talk about what we're doing I'm

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,950
kind of coming out of a shadow mode so

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,500
we are building what we call Aquanaut

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:12,330
it's the world's first a UV / ROV so it

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,550
not only can travel long distances

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,540
untethered but when it gets to a site to

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,590
do some work it can transform so maybe

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:23,380
maybe the world's first real transformer

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:26,050
and so yeah so the world's first like

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,450
all-electric vehicle Telus ROV capable

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,710
of long-range travel and intervention

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,930
when it gets there

00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,840
we're targeting Ross to four when we

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,590
finally deploy our first prototype we're

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,880
hoping to have ready by q2 of 2018 and

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,470
then proceed on with the development

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,200
from there

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:46,200
and we are hiring so thank you very much

00:04:50,610 --> 00:05:01,750
do you accept cash check or PayPal am i

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,930
joking all right we have terribie hello

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,330
world with christoph and right after

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:19,180
that on deck we have felix von drag all

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:21,100
ski all right hi everybody we are

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,260
international and diverse company which

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:29,440
produces sensors and provide solutions

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:31,720
for companies from all over the world we

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,460
developed distance sensors

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,200
time-of-flight based technology infrared

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,320
which is that small it's 8 grams and it

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:45,040
can measure up to a thousand Hertz

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:51,190
depending on the conditions the the

00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:53,530
uniqueness of our product it's its

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,330
modularity so you can basically connect

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,120
up to eight sensors to a single hop you

00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,860
need like here and then you can stream

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,100
the data in one single frame so that

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:07,090
it's easy to deploy on your robot we

00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:09,370
also provide a conversion notes in rows

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,890
so that you can take the standard

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,350
rancher a message light we output and

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:20,080
you can get point cloud laser scan or

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:22,180
range we not only in terribly work with

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,570
sensors we also work on the application

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:28,830
site so we use flows extensively and we

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,830
are happy to collaborate

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,590
you can get our s notes in that link you

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,570
can also see the sensors our reseller

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,970
debate Industries has its booth so you

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,919
can comment and talk to us and you can

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,990
visit our website and by the way like

00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,990
everyone else we are hiring thank you

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:59,630
thank you very much it's gonna be a sad

00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:04,940
day when someone doesn't say that you

00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:09,229
have two clocks okay all right so and

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,090
that's a problem we have using Ross in

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,430
the Amazon robotics challenge with Felix

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,610
right now and on deck we have stanchion

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,610
Eider

00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,349
Oh yawn hi everyone I am from Team nice

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,219
Panasonic my name is Felix we

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,529
participated in the Amazon Robotics

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,180
Challenge last month in Nagoya at the

00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:35,770
RoboCup and I want to tell you how it

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,710
went for us and what we learned and well

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,150
was our experience because in our team

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,770
we had very little computer science

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,629
experience we were almost all mechanical

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,139
electrical engineers a third of us were

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:49,900
from Panasonic our sponsors with lots of

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,669
addition but not very modern tools so we

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,680
knew nothing about Ross basically in

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:55,960
seven months we start up from nothing

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,300
knowing pretty much nothing and we ended

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,810
up in sixth place so we're happy about

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,419
it but how did we do it we needed about

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:07,389
20-25 nodes we had four pcs running six

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:08,800
cameras an extra robot this would have

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:11,289
not been possible without Ross but it

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,360
was hard this is my shout out to evil

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,529
stack the multi that we use for a robot

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,669
this is the video of how it ran on site

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,490
this is pretty much everything running

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,400
at once we had six cameras looking in

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,110
from the base we have two cameras on the

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,330
end-effector there's another Arduino

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,580
controlling the end effector there what

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,260
do you kind of don't see in here is and

00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,169
I don't think I don't think you have the

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,969
point to know we plan everything with

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:43,060
octo maps you kind of see it in the next

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:46,180
video on the right screen which I can

00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,890
skip to but you'll see it later GUI is

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,380
our super important if you don't have

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,160
anything to do with your dead

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,910
that's a biggest takeaway from this

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,820
there's actually a few more lessons

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,829
though that I want to talk about one

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,260
thing that we had as feedback is in open

00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:03,910
RTM we knew about node states and was

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,010
always very useful first to know how a

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,800
node is living how it's doing is it

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,079
crashing is it going slow so the life

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,550
cycle feature that we have heard about

00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:15,459
in Ross - that's something we are

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,410
totally keen on another thing is that

00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:20,230
for us as lots of mechanical engineers

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,810
and electrical engineers when we googled

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,070
simple questions we get into answers on

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,290
Ross answers posts that weren't very

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,670
helpful and our solution was to save

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,220
them and then update them but there's

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,680
too much so if you ever find yourself in

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,959
this position as a new user as a new

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,730
user you've got a superpower you google

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,810
stuff in ways that no one thing

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:43,860
about so take care of what you find

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:47,410
because there will be more like you

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,959
fix it the other lesson that I already

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,029
mentioned is visualization do it as soon

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,820
as possible if you can everything that

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:56,740
film Lee's student talked about last

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,199
presentation yesterday everything was on

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,310
point I completely agree

00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:05,769
the last one is docker and gate were

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,860
lifesavers that was the best tool that

00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:10,660
we integrated what do you know already

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,910
is that it's great for sharing but it's

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,630
also great for when you delete your

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:19,230
entire system I'd have to start up again

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:22,029
so do it

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,920
lastly if you're in Japan look at this

00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:27,360
user group if you want to have camera

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,360
industry internships go there too

00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:39,530
15 enter 14 leave that was awesome

00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,330
though I I see you like to live

00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:43,280
dangerously

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:46,040
alright so behind me right now we have

00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,280
someone speaking on RTI DDS and Ross

00:10:46,040 --> 00:11:03,110
it's stanchion Eider and coming up on

00:10:49,280 --> 00:11:04,670
deck is Doe Joseph Duchene sure hi

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,370
everybody well it's coming up here I'm

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,050
stayin Eider from company called RTI we

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,490
make DDS for the largest of the DDS

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,400
vendors I thought I'd give you a little

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:16,100
of overview of the goodies you're gonna

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,840
get in DDS and what it really is from

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,140
our point of view so first a little bit

00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,240
of RTI we're a pretty big company we

00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,010
have a thousand plus design wins out

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,350
there most of them are real we have lots

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,970
of multibillion-dollar programs where

00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,770
for instance running all of the Navy

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,360
ships or any NASA's launch control

00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,400
system where we were actually the

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,240
architecture lead for the US Army the

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:41,450
u.s. unmanned aviation program we're

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,600
running fourteen different production

00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:47,420
track autonomous vehicle programs

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,610
including Mercedes and Airbus is flying

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,200
car which is pretty cool our biggest

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,240
actually growing industries are things

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,480
like medical device integration medical

00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,120
imaging systems wind power and a large

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,250
systems like Grand Coulee Dam we are

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,690
also very very strong supporters of

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,760
standards we're in 16 different

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,820
consortio there's a few of them on the

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,590
bottom there they're all looking at or

00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,300
trying to think of using a data centric

00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,750
approach to networking and connectivity

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,790
just like Ross's so I thought I'd give

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,910
you a little our view of DDS DDS as a

00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,590
data bus data bus differs from all the

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,450
other kinds of networking out there and

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:25,490
just like a data base I'll talk about in

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,830
a second you as an application have a

00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,450
relationship with the data not with

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,640
another application not with a server

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,670
not with a master not with a client you

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,070
have the interaction and a relationship

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,450
with the data and why does that matter

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,800
well you actually know why it matters

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,540
because you've never heard of a data

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
basis the data science approach to

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,089
storage

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,879
it stores old data see

00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:49,040
you can search it DDS is a data bus it's

00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,079
data science approach to future

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,790
information you can find database you

00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,100
can find you know pert for your Chevy

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,019
and whatever data bus you can actually

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,670
find signals that you need it the rates

00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,550
you need to do feedback control you can

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,470
find vehicles within 200 meters and

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,180
moving to meters a second coming towards

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,889
me you can search for that kind of

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,379
information be notified be guaranteed

00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:12,050
about flow rates and things like that

00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:14,120
just really quick DDS is much a very

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,370
complex thing but it's actually much

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,139
simpler when you take a look at the

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,079
abstraction we're trying to build of

00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:22,999
this data centric world our TPS is just

00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,009
the messaging protocol it's sort of the

00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:28,069
equivalent of the file product the file

00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:32,360
format for a database it's though it's

00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:33,980
the wire spec very quickly RTI is does

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,740
not have an open-source version you can

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,569
say boo now but we do actually offer all

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,189
of our products because we don't do that

00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,259
all of our products all of our tools all

00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:44,059
of our service are free for anybody for

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,990
non-commercial use non-commercial use

00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,670
does not mean you're not a commercial

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,490
company it means you don't have a really

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:51,110
schedule for making money once you do

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,699
that we start calling you commercial I

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,550
do want to invite people to our

00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:57,379
conference hoops in Silicon Valley on

00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,389
October 18 to 19 we'll have some great

00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:02,029
users talking there with a micro grid

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:03,649
thing we have the Grand Coulee Dam which

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,929
is exited largest power plant in North

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,269
America you can see how a real hardcore

00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,089
application can use large software

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,309
systems Airbus will be there Mercedes

00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:20,600
will be there and I'm done

00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:22,639
we are also hiring thank you I had to

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,110
say that thing about the 12 or about

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,069
standards before the guy on twelve

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:31,069
different standards councils comes up

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:32,899
awkward alright so coming up right now

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:36,730
we have someone speaking about flatland

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:39,730
2d simulation Joseph and on deck we have

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,730
Victor

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,400
hi my name is Joseph Duchene I'm from

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,740
avid BOTS and I'm here to talk about our

00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,530
new open-source 2d robotics simulator

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,530
for Ross called flatland so the use case

00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,480
is that we clean a large number of big

00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,250
indoor spaces malls airports that sort

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,260
of thing and we wish to simulate our

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,820
robots cleaning all of the customer

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,900
locations as frequently as we can so

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,290
that we can ensure that we don't have

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:12,590
any regressions that affect a customer

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,330
in terms of performance doing this

00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:19,130
represents thousands of simulation hours

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:22,730
per day so we've had issues with with

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,980
other simulation approaches and we also

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,440
want to generate dynamic scenarios like

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,460
people wandering through a map the room

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,630
changing based on you know daily weekly

00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:38,630
monthly updates so what is it it's open

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:42,110
source C++ BSD licensed plugin live

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,450
extensible designed in simulate indoor

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,060
environments fast we're still working on

00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,760
making it even faster and it's built

00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,670
with box2d for physics Ross publishes

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,070
TFS add-on messages visualization

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,430
messages it's just a server it's not a

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,900
GUI

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:02,450
our plan is to add our viz tools through

00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,120
their plug-in system to add models move

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,360
models that sort of thing it can do

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,700
layered simulation objects with joints

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,830
multi-layer bodies by multi-layer I mean

00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,870
there's like you can have a layer that

00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,760
represents the 2d sensor view a layer

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:20,420
that represents the 3d sensor view so

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,130
like this table might have a big circle

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,120
for the top and a small circle for the

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:28,580
2d support that the 2d planar laser

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,200
could see it supports collision response

00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,130
and filtering through the plug-in system

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,960
sports drive trains right now

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:40,210
differential Drive and a bicycle drive

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:45,170
plug-in supports 2d lighter with noise

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:48,410
and yesterday I quickly ported the

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:52,490
turtlebot simulator it's now on github

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,290
so all that can be found under the avid

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,089
BOTS github and if you have any

00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,889
questions swing by the

00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,809
it's booth in the sort of the far corner

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:04,569
around there

00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:04,569
and we're hiring thank you

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,220
you have certainly set the stage well

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:15,699
for that one some people there's like

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:19,360
one person who got that one all right so

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:29,360
we have Victor speaking about Thiago and

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:30,799
Sammie Pfeiffer on deck okay so with

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,870
afternoon I'm Victor Lopez

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,669
so for engineer at parabolics and I'm

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,250
here to talk about Thiago our Moines

00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:39,380
manipulators I'm a developer not a

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,260
salesperson so I'm gonna tell you why I

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:45,110
like the I was a development platform so

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,960
well first of all we're in Ross con

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,210
Thiago uses Ross obviously everything

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,799
that we do you can hack around you can

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,710
change our nodes you can change the

00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,990
parameters you can add your own stuff so

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,480
software side got it covered but also

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,270
hardware side we have a very modular

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,580
robots you can have our mobile base you

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,980
can put above your own torso you with

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,799
your own arm or you can buy our lifting

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,620
torso with our arm with our gripper or

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,919
our our five finger hand and we have

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,779
several sensor configurations but after

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,299
that we have also made an effort to make

00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,100
the robot easily extendable so you have

00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,809
some mounting points on the head and on

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,140
the back of the robot so you can add

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:29,600
extra sensors extra processing power for

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,549
instance a couple of months ago at the

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,740
rock up the Technical University of

00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,679
Munich participated with the Thiago and

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,779
they used it but they also bastardized

00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,909
it a little bit and they added some an

00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:43,159
artificial skin on developer to the tech

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,470
contact they printed their own fingers

00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:47,899
and replaced our fingers they added

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,659
extra processing power with a laptop

00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:53,299
that's on the laptop tray and the

00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:55,070
directional microphone and this was made

00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,600
very easy without having to modify the

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,149
internals of the robot because we

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,299
provide an expansion panel with some

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:04,130
Ethernet sockets with USB plugs and a

00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,080
power supply so you can add a lot of

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,700
sensors and this is just one of the

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,340
configurations with have other people

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,080
with the screens on the robot

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:16,520
thermal camera so it's something that

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,290
you can extend a lot the main selling

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,480
point or the main the most important

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,490
feature of Tiago is its workspace so it

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,400
can lift it can pick objects off the

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,940
floor and leave it at around 180

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:32,210
centimeters or about six feet and the

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:34,760
workspace is of 86 centimeter or three

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:39,290
freedom units more or less and the torso

00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,780
can lift about 35 centimeters also

00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,270
software we have a lot of tutorials we

00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,550
have tutorials that are related to Tiago

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,490
but they they also are rated to Ross

00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:51,530
control the navigation with movie OpenCV

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,050
point cloud we even have multiple

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,910
Thiago's on gazebos so you can do some

00:19:54,050 --> 00:20:00,550
collaborative experiments with robots

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,550
and we are also hiding so thank you

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,900
thank you and for any aspiring robot

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:14,450
developers in the audience follow their

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:17,420
lead fuses are good all right so we have

00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:21,260
Sammy speaking on the Ross message thief

00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,980
yep okay all right and on deck we have

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,980
Knoll

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,560
hello everyone I'm Sam I'm currently in

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,750
UTS in Sydney working the magic lab

00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,160
which is a really cool place because I

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,860
get to play with a lot of different

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,360
robots people usually ask me for help

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,710
because I have a background in robotics

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,810
and most of the people there are social

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,560
robotics so they don't program the bats

00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:52,990
and usually when I get to a robot yeah

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,730
well I want to see what's going on it

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,830
check a topic and I get this usual

00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:01,870
problem of wow do you not have the

00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:05,080
messages or your empty Fife is different

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:07,570
and you know because yeah Forte indigo

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,320
Ruby whatever I have no idea what's in

00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:13,810
that robot but I found a way around that

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,550
first if I only have network

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,470
connectivity with it so I cannot even

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,270
get in to the road well I mean the

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,730
script called make workspace from all

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,200
publishers which does a really nice

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,030
thing every publisher has a connection

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,470
header inside of it there is a full

00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,710
definition of the message it's gonna be

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,270
using I take that and make message files

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,010
with that I make a fake roast package

00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,860
and you can compile it and you have all

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,210
the message to speak to the topic I for

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,550
example I just tried him that the our

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,860
robot of the PAL guys and we just got

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,630
this like 40 pocket is created to be

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,160
able to speak to the topics but that's

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,530
only for topics which is pretty bad but

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,480
if I have assets access to the robot

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,330
well then you have another script called

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,400
get all runtime messages which scans for

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,350
all topic services action servers that

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,570
are currently running on the robot and I

00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,950
just steal all the messages definition

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,600
from them and the great again

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,460
fake packages with all of them that you

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,340
can just compile in the workspace source

00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,080
and yeah work with the robot which is

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,330
actually what you want to do right but

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,100
also tried just a moment ago well for

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,440
the name packages 200 messages 100

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,650
services 19 action servers with that you

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,090
can speak to what yeah so yeah if you

00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,130
think this is gonna be useful for anyone

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,360
it is very useful for me because I work

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:30,340
with many different robots

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:34,060
there it is thank you thank you

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,280
yeah a lot of times I'm asked if if

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,050
robots can self rewrite their code and

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,580
if we need to be worried about them

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:46,060
taking over I said no robots don't

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:48,610
rewrite their code thank you is this how

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,580
things end all right we've got Noel

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,310
speaking on Eazy moved next open source

00:22:51,580 --> 00:23:05,560
release and coming up after is raga

00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:07,810
vendor so hi everyone I am the

00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,400
co-founder of his mobile robotics and we

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,610
basically develop software for mobile

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,890
robots that get wheels and we have

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,290
developed some software that we use

00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:21,430
every day and we are planning to realism

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:23,650
have already realism in open source the

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,830
first one is called hacker bots it's a

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,110
generic you RDF model that you can

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,600
reconfigure to create every kind of

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,180
robots that get three or four wheels you

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,590
can choose if the wheels got motor if

00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:42,690
it's free or if it's cannot turn so you

00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:47,220
can create a command robots steering

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:50,260
squid steering robots or even we're one

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,840
second packages is called milky chili up

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,740
we were kind of frustrating with the

00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,250
keyboard chili up packages so with this

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,520
software you can click on you can press

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,250
different keys at the same time and also

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,260
it works any kind on your system so you

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:11,260
can you don't have to stay on your

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:18,090
terminal it's also reconfigurable you

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:21,520
can choose the key to force the action

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,400
the other one is called twisting it's

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,090
basically transform any kind of EMU

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,610
hi mu to a velocity equipment we use it

00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,030
with Android send sauce driver

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,880
application to control of our robots

00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,380
with our phone and the last one and the

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,389
more useless one is called droid and

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,299
it's basically

00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:48,969
a software to give a little emotion to

00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:51,489
your robots so this is Leonardo or

00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:54,159
turtle boats there is two nodes on this

00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:56,190
package the first one is Droid ice to

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,139
give a little motion on the screen and

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:04,859
the other one is called through its peak

00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:04,859
and makes the robot talk like how to d2

00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:17,679
so check out or get that give us

00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:18,309
feedback and joy thank you thank you

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,289
very much

00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,539
as a rule I'm a fan of robots with

00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:25,119
wheels there's somewhat less

00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:26,469
intimidating no no they're not nevermind

00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,779
alright we've got

00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:31,839
rageh vendor speaking on person

00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:34,829
following robots and after him will be

00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,829
Leon young

00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:49,499
hi so I'll be speaking in person falling

00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:53,039
robots I'm rock bender the middle guy

00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:54,450
I'm from John Sawers lab so we have two

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,429
approaches for person following robots

00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,559
and we published them this year in two

00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,960
different conferences and we were lucky

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,539
to get awards for each of them so our

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,779
first approaches using selected online

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:08,279
era boosting in this we build use depth

00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:10,289
information on top of other boosting

00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:12,359
approach to tackle very challenging

00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:14,580
situations and we use it on a low-end

00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,039
computer and our approach works at 15

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,859
frames per second and the second

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,419
approach we used CNN's which we trained

00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:26,219
online in real time on a gtx 960 and we

00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,190
test our approach with two different

00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:34,889
cameras said co camera and a bumblebee 2

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:37,109
stereo camera so we can this of this the

00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:39,029
two of the papers perform better than

00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:41,789
the current state of the art as we

00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:43,200
handle different approaches like people

00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:45,089
wearing different clothes and crossing

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,710
each other we are able to handle that if

00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,629
people are removing their jackets or

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,029
exchanging jackets we still track the

00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:53,159
original target under complete and

00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:55,469
partial occlusions and let's say the

00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,839
person is picking up a bag and then

00:26:55,469 --> 00:26:59,099
dropping the bag or if I'm sitting on

00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,929
this chair and then I get up on the

00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,089
chair and start walking or if I'm

00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:06,690
crouching and the robot still follows me

00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:09,649
a different post changes and it works in

00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:12,029
different illumination changes as well

00:27:09,649 --> 00:27:14,839
so I'll just quickly show some videos

00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,839
for the project

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,650
I think it's not letting me play the

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,650
videos

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,549
so I'm just gonna let the videos play

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:44,239
til for half a minute so on the top left

00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:46,489
we have the case for the tracking

00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:48,769
happening using a CNN and on the bottom

00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:50,259
right we have the case when we use

00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:53,330
selected online at a boosting approach

00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:56,090
and you see now that both of these

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,710
people are similarly dressed and it's

00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,129
the robot still keeps track of the

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,840
original target and doesn't lose the

00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:06,019
initial target and on the second one you

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,590
see the robot is able to keep track of

00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:12,559
the original person so these videos are

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:15,259
available online and even if the robot

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,149
loses the target the robot even if the

00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:20,470
person is out of the view of the person

00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:22,639
the robot replicates the pocket path to

00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:25,909
find the target and resume the following

00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:27,919
behavior so we've got a bunch of videos

00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:31,340
like we have six different videos for

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,289
each of the projects and the code is not

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,899
public so if any of one of you is

00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:38,359
interested with the code just contact me

00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:40,759
and I would like to thank NCA for in

00:28:38,359 --> 00:28:43,369
kinda research age programs and all

00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:49,700
participants video credits just a

00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:52,070
thought Thanks that was excellent timing

00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:59,749
I have that was a really really creepy

00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:01,220
pioneer I'm sorry so one time I'm gonna

00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:05,299
say maybe you shouldn't use one of our

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,100
robots all right we have Leon speaking

00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:11,830
about the turtle bought three auto race

00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,830
and on deck we have Alan Meekins

00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,890
hi I am Leon Jung and from robotics and

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:34,850
I want to talk about the told about

00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:37,830
Riyadh race rock n roll the auto race is

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:40,470
the Ottoman striving competition that

00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:44,190
uses the table three and there's our

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,920
four missions but three much missions

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,900
are common but one mission is specific

00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,770
special it's a tunnel

00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:54,900
no lights from the our side yeah

00:29:52,770 --> 00:30:00,150
so the difficulty level I thought is

00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:04,310
Korean yeah but not just this is a line

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:07,530
tracing game is 60% of finishers uses

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:10,230
the tensor flow and other AI high

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:12,860
technique steps it's insufficient is

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:15,990
completely needed because of the tunnel

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:19,670
mission and all the thing in the game

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:23,130
run by Ross especially referee system

00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:27,620
and also in teams from companies many

00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:30,990
companies were participated and one team

00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:33,990
said to us like before game why is this

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:36,170
so easy but every game Lee quite so it

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:42,000
was yeah really

00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:46,260
so we should use absolutely thought

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,950
about River which is a offshore robot

00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:54,770
platform for was education but a tional

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:57,450
parts all also available in this game

00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,390
customizing well it's very simple just

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,370
use climbing so a smart actuator from

00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,370
royalties and also the open source

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:11,670
control module for us which uses Ross

00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:14,010
and another sensors whatever yeah Ross

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:17,190
referred system is here toll gate

00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:19,520
traffic lights star watch was run by

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,520
Ross

00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:37,510
it is a pardon and after that it goes to

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:43,690
the target also run by Ross and you can

00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:46,950
see maybe the stopwatch our rights and

00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,950
go to the teaser

00:31:50,980 --> 00:32:00,010
yeah many sensors I'll pick up the

00:31:54,429 --> 00:32:07,539
capable during this game and many shapes

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:10,830
of total bots are available so our goal

00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:13,510
is very obvious we are aiming to the

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,789
educational and advanced application in

00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:18,220
real vehicle but also want to contribute

00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:20,919
to open source community and studies of

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:29,080
Ultima striving field rosters must be a

00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:30,850
perfect system for this thank you thank

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,690
you very much we'll leave it on Ross as

00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:36,730
a perfect system incidentally I'd like

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:40,210
to thank whoever this whoever has this

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:42,059
laptop because the last two laptops I've

00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,980
used for lightning socks were set to

00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:48,309
German and Korean respectively and I

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:50,169
speak neither behind me we have Alan

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,570
from Ross up speaking and on deck we

00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:54,340
have Anton from I believe that's

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,820
probably intuitive you're speaking on

00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,820
the da Vinci

00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,220
hi I'm Ellen Meekins and I'm the founder

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,370
of our OS hub Robotics Club sorry a

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:14,020
robotics cloud for our OS so our West

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,550
has been a really awesome system I've

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,800
always dreamed of being able to share a

00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,360
sophisticated robotics solutions we've

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,160
got great features and a great landscape

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,740
of people supporting them and of course

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:26,110
wonderful design patterns that encourage

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,480
us to make modular solutions that are

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,730
easy to share however there are many key

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,030
limitations of our OS namely around

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:37,420
security management and operations of

00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:39,040
deployed solutions specifically I call

00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,940
out our lack of user support

00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,490
authentication authorization so the

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,820
solution or a solution to this it's a

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,720
variety as cloud which provides

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,110
credentialing that can be both

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,059
centralized and distributed providing on

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,770
top of that tell operation device

00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:59,110
management process management and of

00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,760
course fleet management now we all know

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:02,290
the engineering process involved in

00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,809
robotics we all just want to get

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,700
something cool out the door but at the

00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,169
end of the day we want to operate these

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,030
robots in the real world and that

00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:12,330
involves monitoring and repairing and

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,859
upkeep of course so there's a whole

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,750
lineup of things that we tend to forget

00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:19,869
about when we're actually building these

00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,730
things so anyways we actually have some

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,649
live demonstrations that are currently

00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:27,010
on the web right now and anyone in this

00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:29,139
room can hop on Rose Hub dot IO / ro s

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,330
Khan and you can actually watch our live

00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:33,369
robot demo I've got my partner from

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,960
ubiquity robotics here in the back and

00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:37,119
I'll say one of my colleagues

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,350
where's he can kick in here in the

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,359
purple shirt and he's wandering around

00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,780
with the robot and you can watch us on

00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,980
the web and let's go to see if we can

00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:52,600
show you a video of what that looks like

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:56,320
when you come on ok do we trust YouTube

00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,410
alright so anyways so we're actually

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,410
able to stream any our OS data any data

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,840
in our OS system on a topic level and we

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,030
can actually credential this data on the

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,859
topic and on a per-user basis and then

00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,540
we can share that across the cloud using

00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:16,330
federated authorization using OAuth

00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,100
alright anyways I still got some time

00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,720
here still got some time alright so

00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,510
anyway so the cool thing about all of

00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,820
this is that we can actually employ a

00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:27,130
high degree of security with a lot of

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,600
sophistication to make it way easier for

00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:30,010
all of us to share our solutions just

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,770
like YouTube makes it easy for us to

00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,940
share videos so with that please find us

00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:41,650
in the backend we'd love to show you

00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:43,860
more I don't know if I need to say

00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,940
anything does anyone want to watch 35

00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:49,630
incredible cooking hacks for the 30

00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:50,230
seconds he's left over it's that one

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,380
right yep

00:35:50,230 --> 00:36:00,570
oh it's 15 minutes I'm sorry maybe over

00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:03,370
the break will stream it alright we have

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,740
we have Anton speaking about The Da

00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:10,110
Vinci research kit and on deck we have

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,110
Joseph and David speaking about armed

00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:21,470
so I'm not if I'm intuitive research

00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:23,150
together but their homes pretty sure

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,430
they're hiring our cutter students tend

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,290
to go there so I'm from the Johns

00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:30,770
Hopkins University and I'm gonna talk

00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:32,329
about the Devon Chi research kid if I

00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:34,819
can figure out how to go here we go

00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:36,770
I assume you know the Devon she medical

00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:39,920
system it for a minimally invasive

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,720
surgical surgeries it's hold till

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,690
operation based it's a beautiful robot

00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,050
it cost about 1.5 to 2 million dollars

00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:52,160
they sold about 3000 of them it's a very

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:54,859
large company it's a complex system it's

00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,010
beautiful but it's not really good for

00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:59,750
research it's a very closed platform so

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,160
what they've done recently and that's

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:03,069
why it's become really interesting is

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,109
the first generation that was realized

00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:08,900
commercialize so in 1999 he's being

00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:11,750
retired an intuitive instead of

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,760
scrapping these arms has been kind

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,790
enough to give them away to University

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,140
and research programs the trick is they

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:20,839
gave you the arm and then you have a

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,359
giant cable with pinout for encoders

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,040
potentiometers and that's it they don't

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,140
give you the mechatronics the

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,440
electronics for multiple reasons first

00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:32,780
of all it was designing 1999 so it's old

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,400
and taught to maintain the other thing

00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,619
is there's a lot of secret sauce in

00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,970
there so I'd be whatever you want to

00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,900
call it and they don't really want to

00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:43,970
see that build over everywhere so they

00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,859
give the arms or you can buy them on

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:50,960
eBay we actually have some people who

00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:53,059
bought a DaVinci 4 9 9 9999 mostly

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,369
because their procurement code from

00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:57,470
university was capped at 10,000 so they

00:37:55,369 --> 00:38:00,980
said we can't pay that so they bought

00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,390
one so after that you you get this pin

00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,859
out and most universities can now

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,890
develop with electronics themselves so

00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:08,569
we develop at Hopkins for past projects

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:11,960
some people from controllers for that

00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:13,730
and intuitive came up to us and says hey

00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,040
can you do that for other people so we

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,420
did then we have a software stack going

00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,569
on top of that and we're everything from

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,369
i/o to kinematics to application - which

00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:24,349
takes a lot of work and we don't have

00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,119
the resources from intuitive

00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:29,569
to do it so we do that of Johns Hopkins

00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:32,089
obviously WPI is helping us on different

00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:33,440
projects and intuitive the community has

00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:35,059
grown we started about four years ago

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,609
but now we have thirty two systems in

00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:39,519
the world that's the map here pretty

00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:42,069
much anyone who does medical robotics

00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:45,079
tend to have one is trying to get one

00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:46,700
the issue of that is it's a large

00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,249
community and we don't have many

00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,279
resources so we four years ago started

00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:55,309
to tap into Ross as a tool so we use it

00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:56,809
for building I mean I pretty much the

00:38:55,309 --> 00:38:59,150
main developer so I put the code on

00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:01,009
github and I think people I don't say

00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:03,769
hey now build it if they had to deal

00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:05,989
with CMake they would kill me some of

00:39:03,769 --> 00:39:08,390
them are mechanical engineers biomedical

00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:10,339
engineers they do come from anywhere the

00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,200
fact that I asked them to use Linux is

00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:14,660
already a problem so that gives you a

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,630
sense of the the part that I have I tend

00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,249
to be very open so I put Ross topics on

00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:23,720
everything we have from temperatures

00:39:19,249 --> 00:39:27,049
from the amplifiers already got we need

00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:30,519
help that one seemed to have snuck up on

00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:34,130
you the clock is down here anyway

00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:36,769
but I'm not sure what is what is kind of

00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:41,059
more intimidating the autonomous s-class

00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:42,499
or the autonomous surgical robot this

00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:44,150
depends where you are all right we've

00:39:42,499 --> 00:39:49,299
got Joseph and Dave talking about Ross

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:52,299
to and coming up afterwards is Daniel

00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:52,299
Perez

00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,490
hi I'm just Fernanda here I wanted to

00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,730
say that arm is committing development

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:13,770
resources to migrate and rose to on to

00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:16,140
our chipsets and with that then we are

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:20,160
seeing a massive growth in the next five

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:23,580
years in regards to IOT m2 and robotics

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:28,140
as well so here we are looking at how we

00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:30,330
can bring secure compute into the Ross

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,860
environment and we want to stop it

00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:35,880
several of our projects that are there

00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:37,380
with the trans owned the if you look at

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,930
what's happening there is that if

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,610
anything goes wrong with the execution

00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,200
environment or the services we want to

00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,750
be able to detect that through watchdogs

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,620
and then correct that protocol action we

00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:51,030
are doing this at our demo booth and and

00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:57,540
David will talk to you about some of our

00:40:51,030 --> 00:41:00,450
putting four rows - hello everyone I'm

00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,700
Debbie one perform a robotics team so

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,730
I'm going to show you some information

00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,000
about what arm is doing for us - so the

00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:11,550
first thing is restaurant kata say so

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,820
roast - already runs on kata date but

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:18,720
with some specific links distributions

00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:21,780
installed like Ubuntu 16 and you need to

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,830
compile the applications locally on our

00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:29,280
course to make the development easier so

00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:31,800
we enabled cross combination for us -

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,680
and to remove the dependencies of the

00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,440
Linux distribution we are going to give

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,530
an option that the application can be

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,770
statically linked with dependent

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:47,130
libraries so with this support you can

00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:52,700
run the Rostow application the

00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,700
lightweight linux for example baby box

00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:59,130
another thing is rose to encode same so

00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,930
our targets to build a minimum rose two

00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,450
stacks with light-weighted s

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:06,380
implementation which can run on the

00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,380
autos and

00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:12,150
we know there was a demo shared in Rosco

00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,640
two years ago but we are going to make

00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,280
this work maintainable scalable and open

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:20,520
source so you can easily build your Ross

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:26,400
to applications cortex-m by using our

00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:28,680
manifest the last thing is hardware DDS

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,349
security so we plan to build your arm

00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:35,040
trust zone based security plug-in for

00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:38,760
DDS implementation the CPU and memory

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,890
are separated into this non secure and

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,470
secure world by the hardware so non

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,510
secure warrants kernel and roster to

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,780
application and the secure world once

00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:51,990
the secure s compared with the TE

00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:54,200
standard so the seek us manage the keys

00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:58,200
and provide the cryptographic functions

00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:02,810
so even if your lynx is cracked so your

00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,810
kids are still jacked sick so thank you

00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:14,430
thank you very much though one question

00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:30,599
are you hiring they are hiring all right

00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:34,770
we have sick coming up with Daniel okay

00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,180
so I'm Andrew Eddington from I am sick

00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,670
in San Francisco and this is my

00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:42,210
colleague Daniel Perez bellow from sick

00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:43,980
in Germany sick makes sensors for

00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,390
industrial and professional applications

00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,430
I think a lot of you already know the

00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:49,200
company today we're gonna try and do two

00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:52,050
things in three minutes one is just to

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,000
tell you what the big news is from sick

00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:57,960
that Ross people who probably want to

00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,849
know this year in 2017 and we're going

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,710
to announce the winners the four winners

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:06,990
of the drawing that we've had for four

00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,250
for Tim's so listen carefully at the end

00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,740
Daniel is going to announce the names

00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:16,440
and come to our booth at the end to pick

00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:17,520
up your your Tim so 2017 the big news

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,170
from sick

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:24,690
is 3d lidar but first there's also news

00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:27,270
many of you know sick for 2d lighters we

00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:30,120
have the widest range of to delight us

00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:32,730
on the planet this year that we're

00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,170
adding two new ones to it and at the

00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:37,070
small end there's actually the first

00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:40,740
sick lidar ever under $1,000 less price

00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:45,120
$7.99 dollars for a 2d proximity sensor

00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,620
which is lidar technology based and in

00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,000
the middle of the range there is a new

00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:54,120
fast 200 Hertz high-speed sixty-four

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,110
meter range outdoor lidar that actually

00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,000
looks like this

00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,620
lidar that I have in my hand here that

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,840
the customs guys finally stopped playing

00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:05,870
with and it looks like this it's this is

00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,560
a platform but this is actually a

00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:09,480
multi-layer lighter that I'm going to

00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,720
talk about any second from now

00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:16,080
so in multi-layer things are just

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,200
exploding at the top right we already

00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:21,810
had an existing for an eighth layer

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,660
product line that went out to 300 meters

00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:27,570
max range we took that because people

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:31,320
were flying it in drones and reduce the

00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:33,360
weight of it and that is was released in

00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:37,890
the first half of the yeren is available

00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:41,670
now we have released last month this is

00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:45,510
a four layer outdoor multi-layer for a

00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:49,380
lidar 64 meter maximum range quarter of

00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:52,020
a degree angular resolution and it's

00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,090
already being used by several of our

00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:58,590
customers and this is available for

00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:02,520
delivery now this is the M Rs 1000 the

00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:05,520
faller product there is a lighter that

00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,560
has coming next month there has six

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,400
times as many layers as this one so 6

00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,470
times 4 is 24 hours and the product is

00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,210
called the M RS 6000 as yet that's

00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:18,510
that's unannounced this is a Rosco

00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,940
exclusive if you like it's coming next

00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:24,890
month so there's going to be 24 layers

00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:28,440
200 meters maximum range and and this

00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:31,170
scanner gives the highest point cloud

00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:35,190
density of any more

00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:37,650
Tyler or 3ds laser scanner on the market

00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:41,160
by a factor of four I'm so it's gonna

00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:43,190
we're all pretty cool yeah so so with

00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,359
that that's a summary what's new and

00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,369
we're just gonna announce four names

00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:52,410
that one it's too late guys see you

00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:54,599
later okay so look the problem with this

00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:58,760
one with customs is that it looks like a

00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:01,079
hockey puck that's what it is

00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,260
alright it's too big we're not sure if

00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,270
it's an American hockey puck alright so

00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:09,540
just if you give me one second please

00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:11,819
so there is we have some people who have

00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,930
won some light ours but before that just

00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:18,480
to make sure that we do have time for

00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:19,770
for coffee breaks we will be we're

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,690
finished up on the lightning talks right

00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:23,590
now so let's give everyone who

00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:27,499
participated a round of applause

00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,499
