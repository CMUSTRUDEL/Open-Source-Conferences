good morning my name is Brian Goerke I'm

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,759
CEO of open robotics and it is my thank

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,699
you it is my great pleasure to welcome

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:27,359
you to Ross con 2017 here in beautiful

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:29,939
downtown Vancouver first of all I would

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,790
like to thank our sponsors we could not

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,190
do this without them we've had a record

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:39,239
sponsor response this year we've got 33

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:41,160
sponsors in total which is more sponsors

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,200
in encount and also in dollars than

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,520
we've ever had before which is pretty

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,530
fantastic and it's just great to see

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,090
some of the biggest players in the field

00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,680
as well as some of the new entrants are

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,660
really interested in coming to this

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,370
conference and financially supporting it

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,500
and then also just connecting with the

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,109
community and I'll say that a lot of

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,579
these folks are hiring and so I highly

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,840
encourage you to speak to the sponsors

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:02,550
go check out their booths and I'll

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,500
explain where that is in just a moment

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,150
I'll also say that everything that we're

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,360
doing here as we always have done since

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,070
2012 is being videoed and it will be

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,350
archived thanks to our friends at

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,030
canonical slash abun too and also we're

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,490
doing a livestream thank to thanks to

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,320
our friends at Tony robotics so if you

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,549
go to the program page I mean you

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,990
shouldn't do this because you're here

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:23,549
but if people go to the program page

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,560
they can find links both for a global

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:26,759
feed and one specifically for China so

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,340
we're really excited to see a lot of

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,990
response online how does this happen

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,000
so every year we convene an organizing

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,340
committee and that's the group that you

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
see on top there and so we're we're the

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,850
group of people who do all the the

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,500
planning sessions and kind of figure out

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,049
how things are gonna go and make some of

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,509
the key organizational decisions every

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,759
year we we pick someone who's local to

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,040
the destination to really help us to

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,780
make all the local arrangements and give

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,850
us advice on how best to do it there and

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,710
this year that's professor Elizabeth

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,770
Croft from UBC so we're very thankful

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,270
for her support in addition we can be in

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,619
a program committee and for that we take

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,270
the organising committee and then we

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,759
recruit other people from the community

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,619
and this year you can see the program

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,680
committee there on the bottom those are

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,409
folks from

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,239
industry in academia who are just really

00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:19,310
key people in the field who were really

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,250
happy to have them come and spend their

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,840
time doing proposal review and deciding

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,760
what makes up the program so this is the

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,140
group of people who decided what the

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,640
material is that you're gonna see here

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,299
today so you can either thank or blame

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,769
them after the fact but I have to thank

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,079
the real organizers the people who

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,750
actually make this thing turn over and

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:40,760
not catch fire are my colleague and the

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,519
CFO of open robotics Roberta Friedman

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,829
and for meet Green Carl ecopra they're

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,260
the folks who really just make sure that

00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:58,010
we have everything here and and it works

00:02:48,260 --> 00:03:00,530
so a big thanks to them this year for

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,970
the second time we ran a diversity

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,280
programmer we are running a diversity

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,890
program and we do this because we

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,489
believe that diversity is important and

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,810
and it's it's something that we often

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,459
don't pay enough attention to and it's

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,170
something that all the evidence suggests

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,329
that if you want to make an improvement

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,459
you have to affirmatively pay attention

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,099
to it and make efforts to support people

00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:23,750
who are from members of who are members

00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,200
of underrepresented groups in your field

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,019
and so to that end we have a diversity

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,370
scholarship committee which is

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:33,109
spearheaded by my colleague Deanna hood

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,690
and she brings together a group of

00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:37,280
people who craft the program put out a

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:40,400
call for applications and then review

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,660
those applications and then with sponsor

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,190
support and you can see our sponsors

00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:46,209
listed here for specifically for the

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,620
diversity program we're able to fund

00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:51,379
people to attend this conference so this

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,000
year we have 16 diversity scholars from

00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,819
nine countries and we're really excited

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,049
to have them here just improving the

00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,370
makeup of our field and this is

00:03:57,049 --> 00:03:59,900
something we're committed to and and

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,669
we're almost certainly going to do again

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,139
next year as we do every year we have

00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:08,000
lightning talks this is one of the key

00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:09,739
features of Ross Khan where you get

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,290
three minutes up here in front of the

00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:15,019
crowd to pitch your idea pitch your new

00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,150
company tell people about a cool new

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,699
tool that you wrote whatever it is we're

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:23,000
gonna start signups for those each day

00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:25,490
at the first break so at 10:45 this

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,030
morning we're gonna start registration

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,440
out

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,000
sign up out of the registration desk

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,740
there's a laptop there if you're using

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,120
slides which you're welcome to you'll

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,620
load them on there and we'll do this

00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,330
first-come first-serve we only have a

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,400
limited number of spots each day we'll

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,410
do sign up each day so I encourage you

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,389
to to try to get in there we're probably

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,730
not going to accommodate everybody but

00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,260
that's how it goes and this is we always

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,610
do this on site we don't reserve any

00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,230
spots in advance because we really just

00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,510
want it to be kind of serendipitous and

00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:55,160
you know who we want to find out who is

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:58,190
most motivated to present their idea who

00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,919
are we so first of all we sold out for

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,450
the third year in a row so we've got we

00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,919
capped the registration at five hundred

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,960
which is we hit actually last week and

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,980
we've got some we're accommodating you

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,020
know there's always a little wiggle room

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,669
so we accommodate a few extra people but

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,110
it's really great to see the the growth

00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,180
of the conference year over a year where

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,370
the the first year we did this we were

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,410
200 people or so in Saint Paul Minnesota

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,590
and I see some 2012 shirts out there

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,660
which is great and now we're more than

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,190
more than twice the size and I think it

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,080
really reflects both the growth of

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,910
interest in robotics generally but in

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,010
Ross specifically so we're really

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,830
excited to see that you can also see

00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,290
here from the demographics we were able

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,169
to collect three registration data the

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,520
global breakdown and not surprisingly

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:44,960
given that we're doing this in Canada

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,169
the lion's share of the attendees are

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,270
from the Americas last year by contrast

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,370
when we did this in Seoul we had almost

00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,630
50 percent we're from Asia so that just

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,250
reflects the fact that it really is

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,600
important where you put an event in

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,400
terms of what the makeup of people is

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,570
going to be I'll also point out that

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,890
historically we've been about two-thirds

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,210
non-student and and one-third student

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,750
and here we're seeing a shift more

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,919
toward

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:11,840
80/20 so I hope we I still hope we can

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,000
attract a lot of students and and we set

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,039
our fees as low as we possibly can and

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,750
also offer a number a number of

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,850
complementary registrations to bring in

00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,440
students but I think it's also a

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,570
positive sign that we're seeing such

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,370
heavy non-student slash industry

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,990
interest I think that reflects the kind

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,590
of the maturation of the field and

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,590
that's a good thing

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,310
logistics we will have two breaks per

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,080
day one in the morning one in the

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,289
afternoon they're fully catered coffee

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,349
and food and so on and

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:43,149
they will be over by the exhibit area

00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:46,089
and we also do lunch

00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:48,610
so that lunch will be downstairs in

00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:51,580
ballrooms C and D and thank you to our

00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,020
lunch sponsor for today +1 robotics we

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,759
will also do as we always have done

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,889
since the beginning a reception that

00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,710
will be at 6 p.m. today after the last

00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:01,180
session and that is brought to you by

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,490
fetch robotics which were very thankful

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,869
for and I'll also make a note here it

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,699
was in the program that we published

00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:08,169
we're gonna do a group photo at the end

00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,059
of that last session before we break for

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:11,409
the reception so please stick around and

00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:15,909
make sure you're here we'll do the photo

00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:17,439
from the stage in terms of the space you

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,749
can see the arrow pointing to where we

00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,939
are right now so for the a.m. and p.m.

00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:23,589
breaks if you go out and turn left go

00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:25,119
all the way to the end aim for the big

00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:27,550
glass wall overlooking the water

00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:29,319
and you'll see the exhibitors and that's

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,550
also where we're gonna do the coffee

00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,909
breaks and that's also where the

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,680
reception is gonna happen and like I

00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:37,629
said lunch is gonna be downstairs and

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,770
also for the first time this year we're

00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:43,809
doing we're doing a poster session so we

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,089
invited all the accepted presenters to

00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:47,919
prepare a poster and you can see those

00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:50,439
lining the hallway as you're aiming for

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,089
the exhibit area the official you can go

00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,529
check out the posters anytime but the

00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:55,689
official poster session is during the

00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,099
reception so during the reception grab a

00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:59,050
drink grab some food and you should be

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,249
able to find the people who are who have

00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:05,529
put those posters up and ask them

00:08:00,249 --> 00:08:09,189
questions there's Wi-Fi details are here

00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:12,219
I think it was also emailed to you if

00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:16,930
you communicate on Twitter then there's

00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:18,939
some random strings as a surprise treat

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,439
this year we worked with our artist Josh

00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:22,869
Ellington who's done all the Ross art

00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:26,409
over the years and had him produce a

00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:29,660
Ross coloring book it's really cool we

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:34,380
had him yeah it's it's it's great

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,200
so we had enough printed that everybody

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,060
here can have one if you go back to the

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,310
registration desk sometime later today

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,720
there is a stack there please don't take

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,220
more than one we only have enough for

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,360
one of each of you and I think there

00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:50,100
will also be crayons and with that I'll

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,120
just thank our sponsors again and we're

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,400
doing something a little different this

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,640
year I'm gonna hand things over now that

00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,630
we're ten years into Ross to my

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,560
colleague and one of the really the

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:07,950
founders of the Ross project Tilly foot

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:10,390
[Applause]

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,920
hi they're really excited to be here

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,360
really excited to see all of you here

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,350
this is really what it's about it's

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,020
about you and connected with the

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,890
community as Brian mentioned our first

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:24,760
ross khan was in 2012 and st. paul how

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:27,400
many of you were here show of hands got

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,380
a good number so this is actually our

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,760
sixth ross khan and it's really great

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,670
every year we've been growing a little

00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,360
bit we had in 2014 we actually had an

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:40,570
event both at Achra in hong kong as well

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,690
as chicago and since then we've been

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,730
following along with i Ross in the fall

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,260
so it's great to have this tradition

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,589
going keep it growing and showing the

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,420
community growing to go with that as

00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,430
Brian mentioned we're coming up on 10

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,500
years in the next month or so we're

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,720
gonna be celebrating the 10 year

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,700
anniversary of the Ross project how it

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,350
got started Willow Garage and then going

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,080
through you can see all the eleven

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,540
different Ross distros that we have

00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,230
released over the years with lunar being

00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,580
the latest if you want to see more

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,120
information about what's going on

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,070
exactly

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,200
I'll have there's the Ross metrics

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,850
report that just came out and you can

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,330
actually see the adoption curve for each

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,040
one over time but in particular with the

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,240
ten-year anniversary coming up one of

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,520
the important things we want to do is

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,320
actually emphasize you in the community

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,850
what's going on out there so if you have

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,339
suggestions for things you'd like to see

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,470
featured and shown off companies or

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,150
people you'd like to see profiled please

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,350
reach out to me and I'll work to bring

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:45,339
that into our 10 year anniversary

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:46,720
celebrations so one of the things I'd

00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:49,120
like to emphasize is that Ross is not

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,490
alone this is just a selection of some

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,260
of the random projects that it came off

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,450
the top of my head as projects that we

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,440
collaborate with the Ross community one

00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,390
of the really important things about

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,160
Ross is that we are a community where

00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,560
our open source and we need to make sure

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,740
to work with everybody else so with all

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:11,250
these projects such as bullet IgAN kdl

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,250
orocos BFL PCL move it

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:19,149
octa map OpenCV gazebo player stage

00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:23,230
Ross industrial and the simple 2d

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:24,580
simulator it's a it's a great community

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,290
and we want to keep reaching out and

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:31,330
growing the projects that we integrate

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:33,959
with etc so as Brian mentioned we're a

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,910
pretty large worldwide community and

00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,920
we're growing quickly this is we've been

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,320
doing the metric reports since 2011 and

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,270
as you can see we have large amounts of

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,060
growth which is really great that's why

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,740
we love having all of you here and also

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,790
for the worldwide community this is a

00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:54,279
snapshot of what we have for the where

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,160
people are visiting the Ross wiki as you

00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:59,500
can see the US has been a strong player

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,320
recently China has been growing a lot as

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,050
well as Japan and Korea and Germany is

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,580
also a major contributor but I want to

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,459
point out there's over 10 countries with

00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,170
10,000 visitors or more per month to the

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:13,330
wiki so it's not like you can see the

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:17,339
big players and dark-blue but all the

00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,339
other countries are also quite present

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,180
so to give you a little bit of history

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,620
going back in time a little bit many of

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,050
you were not and probably not involved

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,220
in the early stages the first versions

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,520
of Ross were actually hosted on

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,339
SourceForge we were there for quite a

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,190
while until we got to the point that an

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,190
Espeon check-in was taking like 4 to 15

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,600
minutes and after we started debugging

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,940
with SourceForge we found out that the

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,310
Ross project was actually the majority

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,430
of commits going into SourceForge at

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,020
that point and that's why we were they

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,640
were providing a free free service and

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,020
because they were sort of the home for

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,450
open-source software at the time we

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,920
wanted to use them but from there we

00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,730
evolved and Willow Garage started

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,020
hosting code.org that is the same using

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,450
the open source engine that is behind

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,190
SourceForge and for a while we're using

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,579
that but then we wanted to move on to

00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,500
more modern version control tools so we

00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,029
switched over to k4 to rasa torque which

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,930
started out with subversion of mercurial

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:18,730
and eventually we added get support from

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,950
there we also started using more of the

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:24,339
community hosting services at Google

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,290
Google code and then of course there's

00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,540
the more modern evolutions of github

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,910
bitbucket gitlab which most of us are

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,840
using these days as the de-facto open

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,930
source community

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,550
Hosting which is really great to see the

00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,500
evolution you can see the moving from

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,000
the centralized version controls to the

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,070
decentralized ones which is great for

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,480
helping the community grow and the open

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:48,850
source ecosystem so I want to go over a

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,190
couple of the landmark robots from the

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,980
Ross evolution many of you I'm sure are

00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,570
familiar with the pr2 at Willow Garage

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,860
when we were developing Ross we wanted

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:02,170
to have a platform that we could show

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:03,880
that Ross was capable of doing cutting

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,020
edge research to do that we needed to

00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,570
have a platform that we could

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,580
demonstrate it on and with that we put

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,190
together the pr2 and this is the first

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,950
robot that was using Ross through and

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,190
through from bottom to top it's been a

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,980
great research product you all seen the

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:26,500
research that came out of that but in

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:27,940
2012 the Baxter came out and we are

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,440
really happy to see that because this is

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,570
the first robot that was commercially

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,900
produced and sold and it was not a

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,190
research robot that was using Ross

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,390
because they wanted the research it was

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,000
actually using Ross under the hood

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,010
because they wanted to it was the right

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,240
tool to use and they felt this is how to

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:48,160
produce a commercial product a little

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,080
around that time as well

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,960
the turtle bot came out the turtle bot

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,700
was a response to some of us at Willow

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,820
we would hear people saying oh we don't

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,620
have a pr2 and we want to use Ross but

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,000
we we don't have the budget for a pair -

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,920
and we wanted to show that Ross can be

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,440
used on anything that can run on Linux

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,840
laptop so taking the Xbox Kinect that

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,040
just come out a netbook and the iRobot

00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:15,100
create we were able to have the turtle

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:18,130
bot other ones we have the Robonaut 2 on

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:21,160
the ISS is running Ross Ross is in space

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,780
this is awesome NASA is using it there

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,220
was a Ross con talk several years ago

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,650
about that if you want to go see more I

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,700
recommend checking that out and I want

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,100
to point out the Husky is one of the

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,090
first commercial outdoor robots taking

00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:40,420
us from indoor and space to outdoor and

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:42,010
field robotics looking back in the

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,890
history of Ross there's been a lot of

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,430
change one of the trends that I want to

00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,880
point out

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,390
is the scale of computing in the pr2

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,320
we had two server boards they had dual

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,660
quad core i7s and they would pull a full

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:04,180
kilowatt of power from the batteries if

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:06,250
you pegged the CPU and this is to give

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,250
you a sense of scale the pr2 only used

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,110
200 watts of power to run all the motors

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,810
if you had the robot flex fully in every

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,660
motor on all do axes it was 200 watts

00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:18,610
where there's a kilowatt of power but

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:22,480
then when we got to the turtlebot we're

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,790
now down in the 20 20 watt range and the

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,990
reason turtlebot 3 the cpu on the

00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:31,029
Raspberry Pi pulls about 1 watt and as

00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,230
we're looking forward I think you'll see

00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,630
some of the talks we're starting to look

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,040
at microcontrollers which are

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,800
significantly below 1 watt of power and

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,750
this is great for the community it's

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,459
great more capability that means our

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,510
batteries are going longer we can have

00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:48,790
longer run times and of course the price

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,430
is coming down the servers and the pr2

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,070
are much more expensive than say a

00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,120
microcontroller that you can get so

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:59,440
that's great to see and following that

00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:04,329
reduction in cost we're seeing

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,949
commercial success with using Ross one

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:09,520
of the ones that many of you may not be

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:13,179
as familiar with was here comm and they

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,360
were Nvidia sorry not envy yeah a Nokia

00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:19,480
subsidiary and they've recently sold to

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,890
out EBM dummy and Daimler to provide

00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:25,240
infrastructure data for the world of

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,840
what they were driving around the world

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,100
with a car just map the world and when

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,200
all of that infrastructure everything

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,750
going on the back end was using Ross and

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,520
Ross bags to collect the data on seven

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,250
continents they were collecting many

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,850
kilometers of data every day with a

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,440
worldwide fleet of cars similarly many

00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,900
of you may have heard of Cruz recently

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:51,070
was purchased by GM to do autonomous

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,580
cars it's great to see that they've been

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,710
using Ross for a long time and very

00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,809
recently Blue River recently was

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,759
purchased by John Deere

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,549
they've been using Ross as an integrated

00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:05,080
product in agricultural robotics so you

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,419
can see we have autonomous cars

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:11,139
agricultural robots

00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:12,909
all coming along and there's a lot of

00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:16,299
startups here that are doing very

00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:17,830
similar things ask around talk about

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,289
them somewhere in stealth mode similar

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,029
not have not gone public yet but there's

00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:25,980
lots of fun stuff coming in the pipeline

00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:28,210
so we can get to these big announcements

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,429
so I want I want to point out one recent

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,070
trend that has been really very evident

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,159
to us recently is tana --mess cars are

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:37,600
coming they're getting very very popular

00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:40,059
a few projects I'd like to point out

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,330
Baidu has recently released the Apollo

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:45,460
project it's a very large project just

00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,940
yesterday was their second major release

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,200
and it's a significant change but you

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,879
can see here from the screenshot that

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,649
it's a large project coming out of China

00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:55,779
so one of the largest open-source

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:59,169
projects in China and it has a lot of

00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:01,659
momentum our next talk is gonna be about

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:03,580
auto air so I'm not gonna give you a lot

00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:06,549
of details I'll let them speak for

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,200
themselves but other projects that have

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,240
been actively using Ross for a long time

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,649
included Bosch you can see this

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,299
screenshot of a recent news article

00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:19,960
where you can see this is a Tesla Model

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:22,600
S with RVs running on the large

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,950
touchscreen this is really cool and it's

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,710
one of the things that I'd like to point

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,330
out is that when we're the Ross

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,820
community one of the best ways that we

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,830
can see projects that are using Ross as

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,850
you see an RV is in a screen capture of

00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,769
a video and I do want to encourage all

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,360
of you to share your projects the

00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:42,249
community loves to hear about them and

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,019
it's way better to get announcement from

00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:45,369
you saying hey we're using Ross check

00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:48,340
this out come join us

00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:50,289
try our stuff instead of just you know

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,619
getting a screen capture Bosch has been

00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:55,149
more public about this another car

00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:57,309
project that has been very public about

00:19:55,149 --> 00:20:01,330
their use of Ross its BMW you can see

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:02,679
this quote from a recent article which

00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:05,110
is great and there's a lot of other

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:07,269
companies here as well doing autonomous

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,029
cars we have a voyage and apex or two

00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:12,100
current sponsors I've always already

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:13,660
mentioned Cruise and

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,450
I know there are a bunch of other car

00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:20,669
projects in the room I'll let you find

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,669
them out though I'll go talk to people

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,280
so as I said we're a large community I

00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:30,390
want to say thank you to everybody that

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,169
has contributed commits into indigo

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:36,539
unfortunately Google won't let me fit

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:39,820
this on one page so goes to page two

00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,039
doesn't fit on two pages it goes to page

00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:44,740
three

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,960
so there are 2800 over 2,800 people who

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,000
have submitted commits to indigo

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,650
packages that are indexed on rosted org

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,870
and I will tell you this is an

00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,640
undercount this is only the package that

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:56,860
have a source entry in the Ross distro

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,169
and are hosted and get my tool doesn't

00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:03,159
yet import from mercurial or some of the

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:07,080
other version controls but this is

00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:07,080
really great and thank you everybody

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,490
so I want to ask you all

00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,990
everyone's here this is great it's an

00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,960
opportunity to share connect with the

00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,190
community there are lots of resources

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,460
out there and we rely on the community

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,280
to keep this project going so when

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,620
you're out there I highly recommend

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,720
everybody go to answers roasted org ask

00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,850
your questions there and while you're

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,320
there try to answer a question there are

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,730
a lot of questions there everybody here

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,010
can go to answers dot Russell at work

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,780
today and answer one question and I

00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,940
challenge you to try to answer one

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,830
question a day even if you're a beginner

00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,570
there's somebody else who is just

00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,100
starting and they will be even more

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,370
beginner than you and you can help them

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,050
get through that first stage but other

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,790
ways to contribute you can open pull

00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,620
requests and issues on github or

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,090
wherever the code is hosted we work

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,880
really hard to make it so that you can

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,020
get to the source code and file tickets

00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,030
there that's the point of the open

00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,440
source community if you file issues in

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,350
bug requests that's the only way we know

00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,330
to fix them if nobody's complained it

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,010
definitely won't get fixed but even

00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,720
better is open a pull request fix the

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,600
problem yourself and help the help them

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,430
maintain errs and there's always

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,900
opportunities documentation is important

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,820
that's how we grow the community that's

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,540
how we get people involved it'd be great

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,570
if you contribute of course we'd love

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,670
contributed contributions the code and

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:38,890
as I was saying earlier we love it if

00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:40,270
you share so welcome to Ross con really

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,820
great to have you here I'm looking

00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,110
forward to meeting all of you and thank

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:53,630
you

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:53,630
