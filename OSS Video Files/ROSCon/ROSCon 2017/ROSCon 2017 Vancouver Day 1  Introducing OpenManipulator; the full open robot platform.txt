okay hello everybody my name is Toby Lim

00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:08,639
from robotics in Korea last year I sit

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,160
there and watch it fantastic

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,769
presentation but now I'm happy to be

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,289
presenter in here I'm going to show you

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,800
our project the name means open

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,800
manipulator have you ever thought about

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,570
your own manipulator the Tony Stark

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,090
developed his own manipulator in

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,140
University and he made Iron Man suit

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,510
with his robot nowadays you can find

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,780
many kinds of manipulators which look

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,420
perfect however you have tried to build

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:44,730
you an omental later and sometimes you

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:47,670
may face this situation so what does

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,059
they need to their to build their own

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,270
manipulator our team focused about this

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,899
question to find out answer so we could

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,539
pull out three key words on it

00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:02,850
first is customization someone needs

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,970
more longer and stronger manipulator

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,250
depends on their environment but it is

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,619
hard to modify it in perfectly designed

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,890
robots

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:16,470
the second is extensibility manipulators

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,259
have various form and have specialized

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,290
functions for each type but most

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,570
manipulators provide fixed type and to

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,119
not guarantee of disassemble and

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,420
assemble it

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:33,540
third is open source students and makers

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,110
want to know how to make it manipulator

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,600
and how to work it so we have started to

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,110
develop manipulator considering these

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,100
three words finally we introduce new

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,220
manipulator the open manipulator is a

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,950
platform to put on your desk it is a

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,240
full open-source manipulator consisting

00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,960
of a dynamo and aluminum frames and 3d

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:05,390
printed parts any support rows Arduino

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,610
and visualizations on to code processing

00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,849
some parts are designed considering 3d

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,840
print or laser cutting so anyone can

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,459
easily modify

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,709
the link lengths or gripper shape

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:22,410
moreover the open manipulator uses

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,110
fabulous actuator the new series of

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:29,190
dynamic cell has different features with

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:32,220
identical appearance through the

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,420
foregoing we can provide manipulators of

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,879
various shapes

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:42,420
skaara link planner delta linear and

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,230
stewart it help you what you build your

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,970
own manipulator the rod supports

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,810
remarkable tools for operating

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,569
manipulator

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,329
we already provides some packages for

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,250
open manipulator so let's see how it

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:58,410
works

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:01,410
this video shows open manipulator is

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,720
working in cattivo simulation so if we

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,290
want to operate the manipulator quickly

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,569
you just launch on your laptop and also

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:15,239
you already provide movie example for it

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,850
how about embedded system open

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,609
manipulator can be controlled by open CL

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,959
with arduino and processing is the most

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:28,410
favorite tool for visualization so we

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,650
provide api for opening later and it

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,470
makes easier to work with it we want to

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,079
make simple visualization tool like a

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,650
beach so you can make algorithm to use

00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:45,590
it with our platform and control it make

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:49,230
motion using graphic user interface and

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,959
one more thing the open crater is

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,930
perfectly comparable with tor above 3 as

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,790
you know that turbos 3 uses velocity

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,370
control mode of tanam cell an

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,680
appointment later also uses Dunham's

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,590
style which is that different control

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,849
mode so if we wants to make mobile

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,970
manipulator

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:13,319
you only need component of turbot three

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:15,720
and open manipulator and dynamo so you

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:20,600
can show that the open meant Plato picks

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:24,470
a bottle and gives it to scary dinosaur

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,480
as I told you the manipulator is full

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,310
open-source platforms so we have

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,300
developed three different types and

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:35,570
other types are now in progress so if

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,120
you have any idea or any concept let it

00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,960
build your own manipulator with open

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,080
manipulator

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:47,140
so thank you see you in my robotic booth

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,140
