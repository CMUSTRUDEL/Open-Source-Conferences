Title: LPC2018 - Towards a Linux Kernel Maintainer Handbook
Publication date: 2018-11-28
Playlist: Linux Plumbers Conference 2018

speaker:  Dan Williams (Intel)


The first rule of kernel maintenance is that there are no hard and fast rules. While there are several documents and guidelines on patch contribution, advice on how to serve in a maintainer role has historically been tribal knowledge. This organically grown state of affairs is both a source strength and a source of friction. It has served the community well to be adaptable to the different personalities and technical problem spaces that inhabit the kernel community. However, that variability also leads to inconsistent experiences for contributors across subsystems, insufficient guidance for new maintainers, and excess stress on current maintainers. As the Linux kernel project expects to continue its rate of growth it needs to be able both scale the maintainers it has and ramp new ones without necessarily requiring them to make a decade's worth of mistakes to become proficient.

The presentation makes the case for why a maintainer handbook is needed, including frequently committed mistakes and commonly encountered pain points. It broaches the "whys" and "hows" of contributors having significantly different experiences with the Linux Kernel project depending on what subsystem they are contributing. The talk is an opportunity to solicit maintainers in the audience on the guidelines they would reference on an ongoing basis, and it is an opportunity for contributors to voice wish list items when working with upstream. Finally, it will be a call to action to expand the document with subsystem-local rules of the road where those local rules differ, or go beyond the common recommendations.

this this was a very difficult topic to

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,660
get started

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:21,700
before and this was the most difficult

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,110
it was difficult because not only is it

00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:29,680
a a wide problem space but there's the

00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:31,920
possibility for strong opinions and that

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,120
was I came back to that realization

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,370
before the Code of Conduct came out and

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,500
that kind of reinforced some ideas about

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:43,720
strong opinions but so the way to get

00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,730
over the hump on any of these things

00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,870
where things are difficult is if you're

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,370
not sure you're gonna be able to do it

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,610
go ahead and sign up to do a

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,900
presentation at a conference nothing

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,390
nothing like a deadline to actually make

00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,080
you do something difficult so here it is

00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,489
the I will say up front leader some

00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,659
slides that hopefully provoke some

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:03,040
conversation if we don't get through

00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:06,570
them or if you get off-track that's okay

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,650
this is a starting point not a end point

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,110
well let's let's do it let's do a quick

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,979
survey of the room how many are on team

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:19,170
xmas tree how about

00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:21,189
Comicon team reverse Xmas tree okay and

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:35,100
how many people on what the heck are you

00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:38,890
talking about alphabetical order

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,200
so so Xmas tree real quick is a real

00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,460
debate that different maintain errs have

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,229
come on different have landed on

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,750
different size this debate and it's it

00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,610
deals with how do you order variable

00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,500
declarations in see you can do them in

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,380
xmas tree order where things get longer

00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,640
and longer and longer or worse where the

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,899
reverse is true and then there's the

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,349
matthew approach is just burn it all

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:03,849
down so different maintained errs have

00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:07,239
different opinions so before we get

00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:09,640
deeper as I kind of said before this is

00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:11,170
the talk is not about an end state this

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,459
is not a completed completed work of bar

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,739
I'm not going to show you the the

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:19,630
maintainer guide today the maintainer

00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:21,910
handbook and this really is a is meant

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,590
to be a conversation between maintainer

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,750
so this is this is the maintainer guy

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,519
not a guide for contributors to

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,090
contribute to my to my subsystem this is

00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,769
a handbook for maintainer z-- to Co

00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,319
maintain and communicate with each other

00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:39,810
so it's not for if you're a contributor

00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:42,069
you can stay but it's not for you but

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,930
it's important that you're involved in

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,430
the conversation because this stuff

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:56,769
directly it directly impacts you go

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:58,060
ahead hello it was my box is represented

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,540
earlier today that maybe you would be

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,609
interested in helping maintain errs deal

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,799
with contributors as well or is that not

00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:08,470
part of your what you're working it is

00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,209
it is part of yes it's it's it's

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,829
knowledge sharing about how to have to

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:14,019
deal with all the things all the things

00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:15,220
maintenance and that involved it also

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,239
includes dealing with the contributors

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:22,480
and so so we will get to that okay but

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,280
if you came here trying to understand

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,599
having how to contribute better you may

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,700
not come away using the thing but if you

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,310
came here to learn how to maintain

00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,800
not better this how other people do it

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:36,459
as well share information than this

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,200
maybe maybe they talk for you but what's

00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,090
the big deal I mean curl Maidan

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,580
maintenance is pretty straightforward

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,900
it's there's there's no surprises the

00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,970
merge window is simple you just send a

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,390
get request pulled to leanness done you

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:51,130
don't need to do anything else the if

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,080
you happen to work on one subsystem you

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,670
could those skills are instantly

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,980
transferable to any other subsystem you

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,019
don't need to ramp up if once maintainer

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,549
always always a maintainer and there's

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,430
no differences between between any of us

00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,380
and if you happen to need to take a

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,579
vacation or if you get or this is the

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,069
bus factory if you happen to be hit by a

00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,720
bus and and you're not there to maintain

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:15,610
your subsystem don't worry there's

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,680
there's continuity of course not the the

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,799
merge window is a stressful time for all

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
maintained errs it takes it takes it's

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,010
an art form to be able to break things

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,389
down into different topic branches and

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,350
make sure that those topic branches are

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:31,120
coming together cleanly you do encounter

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,780
having to talk to other people that's

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,780
that's annoying

00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:41,570
and you have to kind of prop is there's

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,550
like a there's like a it's like a flavor

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,350
of patches that Lina's can smell them

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,670
when they like this this you didn't even

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,310
cook this this is raw meat this is like

00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,630
it'll have a Gordon Ramsay moment why

00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:55,610
you didn't cook your your patches enough

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,260
and as we just saw in the example of

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,910
Xmas tree reverse Xmas tree the the

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:03,920
grand debate it the process is very many

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:08,800
levels across many substance systems for

00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,800
many valid and for many valid reasons

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,780
and there are there is no for a lot of

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,250
subsystems there's no backup plan and

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,780
this this can be isolating especially if

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,310
you're the sole person in the subsystem

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,780
may feel like you just can't even take a

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,330
break because there is nobody else that

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:30,200
you would trust to come in and do the

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:32,570
same job or or is available so this is

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,930
the this this is what what I think we

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,370
are we're a group of that sticks

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,230
together and gets things done but we're

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,130
all pointing in different directions

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,840
doing various different things at

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,760
different times somehow it all comes

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,040
together in the end and we make kernel

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,380
releases but it's a it's a bit it's a

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:53,090
bit of a of a gang of opinionated people

00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,300
that that are all they're all trying to

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:57,950
do the best for the kernel but but don't

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:03,620
don't necessarily agree and they don't

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:07,450
have to agree to get the job done okay

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:11,840
so what I want to kind of cover today is

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:13,370
why a handbook I give credit to LAN to

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,710
saying it's a handbook because that

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,700
sounds less prescriptive and more you

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,840
know reference II and I asked this might

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,640
ask myself the second question all the

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,460
time especially when I was preparing

00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,070
these slides

00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:32,380
and and then getting more into the

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,540
actual meat of what what would be in a

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,880
maintainer handbook and I have some

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,580
strummin strawman arguments here that we

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,170
can we can pick apart and the point of

00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,610
doing it here and doing it live is to

00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,740
get that live feedback and to say oh

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,390
yeah I didn't mean to do that and we can

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,920
go in a different direction it must

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,770
easier to get that instant feedback live

00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,320
than it is over over over man

00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,830
mailing list so first the first the

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,880
handbook

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:01,360
it's about being a reference if this is

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,530
not this is not a a thou shalt maintain

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,210
this way this is a these here here's a

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,560
collection of tips and tricks that other

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,080
maintainer is use maybe you might find

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,520
them useful here are some policies

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,750
decisions that all maintainer is making

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,390
you may answer them differently for your

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,910
subsystem but it's this is right now

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,770
this is a bunch of tribal knowledge

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,790
that's floating out there and people

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,020
have a sense of what it means for

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,100
different subsystems but there's no you

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,810
can't go find it out and you have to go

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,450
ask somebody and it might might change

00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:30,250
so that's this is a reference something

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,430
you can keep on your desk and say how do

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,040
I handle a cross tree merge what's the

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:39,640
best way to prepare my my pull request

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,150
for Elena's it's all a cart take it take

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:46,090
some of it leave the rest of it

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,490
let let it be a place where maintainers

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,560
can can can hang different pieces of

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:56,140
documentation and and Sheridan and and

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:59,170
bat it back and forth and also capture

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,060
when when there is some maintainer

00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,170
debate or process issue that gets

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,910
discussed on the mailing list is using

00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,440
some great advice on the mailing list

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,760
and then it if it stays on the mailing

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,980
list it never goes anywhere that you can

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,520
go reference back later what are we

00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,610
talking about

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,650
but there's really an ulterior motive

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,480
for all of this and it's that there's I

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:22,270
perceive maybe you perceive it too that

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:26,140
there is some pain in the some pain in

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,050
the process and what can we do to

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,000
alleviate some of that pain and I think

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,190
it's there's potential for pain in all

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,340
directions so all those red air red

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,930
arrows contributor pain trying to get

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,520
and maintainer to do something

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,159
maintainer pain trying to get trying to

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,380
get your pull your system updated

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,330
correctly each marriage window the

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:52,660
feedback can be can be can be strong at

00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:55,570
times and and all these places for

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,600
friction and so some some ideas and

00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:01,770
these these these are ideas that we can

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,160
begin back back and forth but what if as

00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:10,510
a contributor as a maintainer you made a

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,550
statement about contributors expect me

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,230
to get back to you on new patches in

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,760
this amount of time and it could be

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,649
something like that you know you can

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,149
meet like two weeks so Mike that's but

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:21,250
there's some there's some kind of

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,990
bounded time that you said hey I might

00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,360
be able to get back to you in this time

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,860
and if I don't then maybe you should try

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,630
to go to the next step and say maybe I

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,890
missed it or like just just write it

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:40,000
down I two weeks like that but in

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:43,959
addition to that is is maintain the

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,490
maintainer don't scale I think I think I

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,100
think everybody asked any maintain in

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,140
the room like if if if there's new

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,000
passion on your on your mailing list and

00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,260
this person repeated or this person took

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,209
a look at it then you would take a look

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,100
at it too and you kind of have those

00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,050
people in your head of like I trust

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,370
these people to recommend code to me or

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,350
I trust these people to kind of do a

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,630
first pass of things before I can take a

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,070
look if those people are identified two

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,720
contributors then then maybe they can

00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:09,070
say hey I haven't got any tension from

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,910
maintainer but could you take a look at

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,730
this

00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,900
could you help that nuts just along

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:22,560
because because maintainer time is is is

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:25,779
sometimes stretched and so addressing

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,000
some of the pain that that that some

00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:30,940
contribute maybe unintentionally inflict

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,589
on maintained errs sometimes comes down

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,880
to misaligned expectations it did did

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:38,440
they maintain the Katti batti even know

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,170
that there was a test suite for your

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,790
subsystem do they is it listed anywhere

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,020
that they'll find it is it or is it just

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,880
tribal knowledge like oh yeah everybody

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:50,410
runs next best test before they send it

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,820
and exit best patch which I'm pretty

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,980
sure people do you know but yeah but

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,930
really it's written down for XFS but

00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,340
it's not written down in a way that you

00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,290
could generically walk into any

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,610
subsystem and say where's the test suite

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,290
you can't you can't answer that question

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:04,990
ask that question you have to you have

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,840
to already know some subsystem specific

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,750
way places go look to go look for it and

00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:14,220
like I said before if you know how long

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,440
to wait then then you're not then

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,270
because this is why this is why

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,620
computers have progress bars is you'll

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,430
wait in forever as long as you know how

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,620
long you have to wait

00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,870
and so this breaking that silence of

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,550
expect to wait this long or this this is

00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,310
the maximum wait time can help relieve

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,560
some of that stress and then there's

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:37,720
preventable maintenance mistakes sending

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,920
stuff upstream the there there probably

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,960
some maintain is that they have an

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,140
amazing SLA and some that have some that

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,140
don't and we use and annually we have a

00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,520
case the kernel summit or maintainer

00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,350
summit mailing list like pops up and

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,120
people propose ideas and then and some

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,740
of those threads they they go into these

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,240
devolve into like oh well I do this for

00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,100
my process and like and we get that like

00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,330
once a year once a year we have people

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,040
come out of their shells and tell the

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,440
people tell all the people their best

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,510
practices and it'd be better to collect

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:10,870
those there's also a lot of learning

00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,950
that happens when you mess up and going

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:24,070
back and writing down what you learned

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:27,160
is is is huge why me yeah so so I've

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,740
been I've been contributing about 13

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,640
years and I've been from arm to x86 and

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,830
back put a lot of time in in store

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,440
stuffs of storage systems and things but

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,430
the I think the important thing is is

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,340
what I've learned by working through

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,250
different different subsystems and I'll

00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,230
also say that this is this is just a

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,520
small part this even this is just a

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,620
small part of the kernel so I know

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,760
there's other opinions about about and

00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,930
other experiences out there that we can

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,000
capture but these are just some of the

00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,780
main lessons I've learned along this

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,780
along this path

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,510
I I sometimes look back and wonder if my

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,360
first patch hadn't my first major

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:11,400
patches hadn't been to Neal Brown for

00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:14,610
example like Neal had the time took the

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:17,430
time to say yeah this is not great but

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,900
or did this way and then I found other

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,520
experiences where I'm hey I'm new to the

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,600
subsystem here's my first patch yeah I

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,010
have had negative reactions and and but

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,970
I mean but maybe I maybe I caught the

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:31,620
maintainer on a bad day but it it would

00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,470
be nice if it wasn't the case that we

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,240
would gain or lose contributors based on

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,920
what subsystem they happened to land in

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,920
and the and the mood of the maintainer

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,250
on that on that day I've generally found

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,970
that subsystems with the team are

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,740
healthier in the sense that we all we

00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,630
all get burned out and teams that have

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,570
and maintain such as I have that have

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,770
maintainer team so they you don't that

00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,200
burner doesn't seem to be reflected

00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,160
towards the contributors as much as when

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,740
as a single person

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,410
I'll buy themselves trying to trying to

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,260
tread water I think the most important

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,630
thing I learned is so the Astrix ones

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,330
are ones I maintain is that I caught

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,940
myself inflicting some of the same pain

00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,840
that I wish I'd had inflicted upon me

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,000
and things like oh yeah I didn't respond

00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,080
to your patch for a month or whoops I

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,220
mean but but but just realizing that

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:33,060
that it can come full circle and it's

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,980
easy to to make two unintentionally

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,600
inflict pain on in the process that

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:42,060
doesn't need to be there okay so let's

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,670
let's let's get to some some meat of

00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:48,360
what might be in this handbook that we

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:52,430
as cats can all agree on

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:56,310
I call these after the blow-up males and

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,510
I think I think maybe we'll have less

00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,430
blow-up so now that we've kind of agreed

00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,170
on maybe some more contact things but

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:05,430
the one thing I'll note about when I've

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,020
been yelled at and leanness in the past

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,670
is there is the bloke male and it's not

00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,670
pleasant and nobody learns anything from

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,470
that but and and this is why I

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,060
I trusted leanest when he said hey I

00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,890
need to work on my empathy but I trusted

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,680
that he'd get there because he sends

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,180
he's great like yeah you had the blow up

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,260
everybody's everything they're happy and

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,430
then there's an email afterwards

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,530
actually kind of say hey I messed up

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,290
that he just goes through and explains

00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:31,020
as if you were the first person to ever

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,200
ask that question detailed here's what

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,150
you should do and I've noticed that that

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,460
feedback has been repeated and it's been

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,720
equally patient each time and why isn't

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,010
it written right why isn't it written

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,530
down somewhere if somebody got them

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,820
feedback these great messages well why

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,110
can't you why can't why can't the next

00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,250
maintainer come along and reference hey

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,850
what do I do when I hit this situation

00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:55,170
and so with that let's if you if you've

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,210
experienced one of those and you have a

00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,710
leanness explain this to me right or

00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,180
some other maintainer made explain this

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,760
to me really great it helped you with

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,110
your maintaining your code let's let's

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,130
start a gallery of those kinds of things

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,390
I don't know how to organize those but

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,550
hashtags I don't know we can put them in

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:15,210
there to kind of let people search this

00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:16,880
stuff but in general having a place

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:21,840
where people can drive by and drop off

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,760
here's how I do X and and this just

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,470
capture that is a starting point so a

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,390
lot of this is like let's just start at

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,920
the basics of this capturing the stuff

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,180
that we know we can capture before we

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,490
even get before we even get to the

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:39,590
harder stuff like consensus and I think

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:41,700
the the act most act most actionable

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,470
straightforward thing I can propose

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,830
today is something I'm calling the sub

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:49,680
system maintenance profiles and what

00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,510
does that mean well let's actually let

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,190
me let me get example one of these that

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,090
I'll go back and give you examples of

00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,080
what I'm talking about for the other

00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:59,850
ones before you before we do the

00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:04,140
maintainer profile so this is this was

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,400
this was me learning June after I've

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,810
been doing this for 13 years and I've

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,480
been I've been doing I've been merging

00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:14,760
my topic branches incorrectly the mail

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,430
before this was it was was angry but but

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,950
this one was was followed up with with

00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,630
just paragraphs of here's why and here's

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,740
my other main here's my other subsystems

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,180
do it this way and maybe you should be

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,900
like them but don't don't go too far

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,140
because

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,690
it was it was just a huge explanation of

00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:34,260
what what he expected to see so if we

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:40,280
didn't jump past the flames and into the

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:42,630
advice that's always great but yeah in I

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:48,360
like I like the ending of this one and

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:50,640
then I curse but but it it always makes

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,830
it make sense in retrospect and and the

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:58,550
and the patience of the explanation is

00:17:52,830 --> 00:18:01,080
appreciated so we actually already have

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:04,590
where do you have a handbook Tobin had

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,210
had taken some some advice from from

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,150
Greg and just wrote it up and threw it

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,880
into a throw it into a in the

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,190
documentation tree and and John put in a

00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,920
plea to say hey other people and stuff

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,620
here and and you haven't gotten there

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:21,330
yet so let's let's let's endeavor to

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,490
change that let's let's fill this let's

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,840
fill this handbook out and so the first

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:29,270
thing I think we can fill the handbook

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:33,540
handbook up with is a subsystem profile

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:36,150
and I think we get into the habit of

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,400
wanting to just describe two

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:41,190
contributors thou shalt do this

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,870
contributors and we well and we

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,360
obviously haven't spent any time

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,960
describing to each other how we maintain

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,180
our trees and so the idea here is if you

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,500
were going to go away what would that

00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,660
what would the document be that you

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,680
would leave your leave your replacement

00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:00,960
and what policies are in place that you

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:05,010
that you want them to kind of expect the

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,020
next maintainer to maintain and having

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,300
those discussions out there also lets

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,370
people compare these policy choices

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,840
across subsystems and also it's less

00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,230
contributors know that oh yeah this

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,840
these things might be different so I'll

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,440
run through some of some of these we can

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,400
do thumbs-up thumbs-down groans or some

00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,810
of these are pretty straightforward and

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,510
a lot of these are just one line answers

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,580
so patches are patches or pull requests

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,900
that's a contributor I didn't know in

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,100
some systems okay yeah I got a lot of

00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,100
patches here maybe able to send a pull

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,360
request and they're there actually I

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,570
think it's very few maintainer trees

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,820
that actually do pull requests

00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,950
net does and I think graphics but a lot

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,650
of other people just want patches so

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:50,430
just the state are we a pastor or a

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:53,700
poultry or mix of both the last day for

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:55,890
new feature submissions is based is when

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,870
in the RC series should you expect that

00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,550
the maintainer is just not gonna look at

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,550
your is going to want to defer your

00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:06,690
patch to the next Ridge window so I'm

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:09,120
thinking if RC for if you haven't

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,770
submitted something by RC for then maybe

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,180
you should target it toward the next

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,270
merge window but different maintainers

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,760
can have different opinions about that

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:20,640
certainly there's a last day to merge

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,680
features where if you haven't it hasn't

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,910
hit the tree by RC six in some trees or

00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:28,020
RC seven or before final it depends but

00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,370
if I haven't had a tree by this point

00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,510
you should expect that you're going

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,810
you're going to the next merging window

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,340
and not not sending a panicked email

00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:37,110
through at the end of the merchant or

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,480
did you merge my path

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,640
it's up front that that things when

00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,870
things are too late and and you can you

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,580
can see that you can know that ahead of

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,320
time and more important you can tell

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,400
your manager with this too late look

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,110
there's a document that says it's too

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,560
late so don't ask me to go how in this

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,540
manager go how this maintainer because

00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,490
yep I think I think I think I think

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,690
managers like to see documents to say

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:03,780
why or other employees can't do things

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:07,650
so here is maybe one that might grow get

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:10,230
some groans but advertise upfront

00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:13,230
whether configured clinics can expect to

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,690
see self contributed patches by the

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,060
maintainer is this a tree where all

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,410
patches get reviewed or sometimes the

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,180
maintainer will sneak their own patches

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:26,790
in and it won't be reviewed this at

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,990
least let's let's it's when so I

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,460
recently changed this for my own

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,680
subsystem for an be dim I said I'm not

00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,540
because I look at the history like I

00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,400
still committed a ton of patches and I

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,440
said no I don't like this where I'm

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,030
going to submit to my own process of

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,680
everything I said everything I write I

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,600
got to go hunt down a reviewer for it

00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,730
and that kind of democratizes

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,830
contributors and maintainer x' in terms

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,500
of contributions and I think stating

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,410
that in the

00:21:48,500 --> 00:22:00,800
in this profile is a useful piece of

00:21:51,410 --> 00:22:02,840
information policy information maybe for

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:07,900
for the for the power dynamics aspect of

00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,400
it of all patches must be reviewed but

00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,310
but it's but that's not prescriptive

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:19,040
like so if for sub sub system view you

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:20,300
don't do that then then don't do that on

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,970
call if you implement a significant

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,100
feature it's probably the right thing to

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,920
do to post it because people might want

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:31,700
to debate how it's done anyway if you're

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:41,660
gonna fix a build breakage that snuck

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:43,100
into the tray you just fix it so this

00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,180
one that I was like I'm gonna write it

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,310
down just because I might this will

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:51,020
probably wake up the room but we can we

00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:53,360
can certainly the other ones there's I

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,100
actually run one I have a pair of trees

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,520
I run and I run them in different ways

00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:01,070
the RC tree I don't require reviews of

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:11,900
my patches not because I don't want them

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:13,190
because that's appalling anyway there's

00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,370
another one less real mailing list

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:20,570
memory model tree that one everybody has

00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,410
to get including myself I think for the

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,160
same maintainer to have different

00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,230
policies for different subsystems and

00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,000
there's no there's no judgment on

00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,020
answering these questions in any which

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:39,170
way it's just a this is the policy there

00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:42,260
is this information reference okay but

00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,390
so back back to the easy one a test

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,130
suite just that's pretty straightforward

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,080
passed this test we've before you expect

00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,730
anybody can look at your patch and if I

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,530
get to your patch and I run the test

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,850
suite and the packet fails then I'll

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,010
point you back to the document said I

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,670
told to you or this document says that

00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,860
to run this and you know I didn't the

00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,970
trusted reviewers is there too because

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,210
maintainer is kind

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:09,450
retainers is is kind of official and

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,010
huge and maybe implies more code

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,110
ownership and more responsibly than

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:15,330
maybe one but there certainly there's

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,220
something below maintain is having your

00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:21,360
name in the maintainer spa work but the

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:24,210
subsystem will has grown to appreciate

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,210
your reviews and and would would take

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,210
would would appreciate that person being

00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:32,280
a front-end triage for patches coming in

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,410
to help take the load off the maintainer

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,410
so so this is the list of people to go

00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:40,590
ping when when you're not get any

00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:42,360
response and maybe they can help out so

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,390
done we actually already have this in

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:51,870
the maintenance file there's an R :

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:53,640
on some but I can speak to me more

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,290
dynamic and in private and press up so

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,750
if summers going touching a big global

00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,040
file I'm I guess Lena's also talked

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,840
about breaking a maintainer is anyway

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,370
into a pretty directory tree so maybe

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,080
when that happens this gets easier too

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,710
because yeah there's something about

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,000
sending a patch to that file versus when

00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,410
it can be kind of more something more

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,720
local okay this really is a local policy

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:15,150
in that a it needs to be advertised of

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,860
the whole kernel the resubmit cadence we

00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,960
kind of talked about and just just

00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,190
explaining that this is this is when

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,220
people that work on the subsystem

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,570
normally sleep might might help to

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,550
because you keep something you don't

00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:30,210
know that you're that you're talking

00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:31,410
across the world which is great we

00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,470
talked and I think in last talk there's

00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,940
there was a Mel was saying how the mmm

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,910
subsystem doesn't want cleanup patches

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,350
because that destroys get blame and

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,630
there's other subsystems that they do

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,310
want them and so let's let's think that

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,770
list let's not have people waste their

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:48,540
time sending these things when when when

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,890
you can be told up front known that's

00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,940
not appreciated or yes go here if you

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,390
want to do that if you want to do that

00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,700
kind of work this one came up recently

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,960
it's it's a policy on whether you

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:03,870
whether you would trust as a maintainer

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,710
patches coming in pre reviewed by by the

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:09,510
company that's sending them so like my

00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,630
the subsystems so subsidized I maintain

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,610
I think I'd like to see the actual open

00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,860
discussion

00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:20,810
oh the reviews I went to that patch but

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:22,700
other times when and where a maintainer

00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:25,460
is like I've I've received a lot of a

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,810
lot of patches from this organization I

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,080
wish that organization can I just did

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:31,790
some more just a more prior review and

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,460
and but at least have it be a policy

00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:37,220
that stated a friend saying hey these

00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:39,680
please please get this reviewed off list

00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,720
and before you even submit it versus

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:54,470
whatever you do try to do all that

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:56,660
review online if an organization has a

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,340
tendency to send crap patches and you

00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,930
want them to do bit more if it's a prim

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,250
of that specific contributor it's not a

00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:10,010
general policy that you want

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:11,630
organizations in general okay so if you

00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:20,900
work for Intel please get your stuff for

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:24,500
you before you persist this is me I made

00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:27,410
this comment and there are some

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,840
companies who dump brand-new subsystems

00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:31,970
on me to be the only reviewer I see one

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,700
signed off by and these organizations

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,140
have huge numbers of kernel developers

00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,290
that should be helping out to find the

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,730
basic problems now how do you do this

00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,010
for brand new subsystems I can't say

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,530
because I review all new brand new

00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:48,440
driver subsystems from this one company

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:50,540
I want to have this maybe I would like

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,880
to I like to and I try and push back on

00:27:50,540 --> 00:28:07,970
that but but a brand new company whose

00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:10,220
there's only one developer you can spay

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,110
told you that if your company happens to

00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,930
have a significant amount of experience

00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:16,730
Linux developer please get your patches

00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,980
reviewed by them before you post them as

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,020
a general rule which it makes sense I

00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,070
mean we also all do and like having our

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,960
colleague you have a look at what we've

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,690
done before we throw it out for for

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:31,700
picking

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:35,990
naming and shaming is never really it's

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:39,860
about it's about I'm I I'm a maintainer

00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,620
I have a huge load I see I see the the

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:46,220
potential for other people to do the

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,420
review and that also makes so so say if

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,100
there was if there was a policy that

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,540
come today you said company Xpress gets

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,520
interviewed that actually is the

00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:54,440
motivation internally to say hey we need

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,340
to spend time like it's you can tell the

00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,540
manager when you spend time with this

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,520
because this this subsystem has this

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,790
policy so you're setting expectations

00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:04,340
yeah I mean if it's a real policy then

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,900
it be wary of naming and shaming an

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,280
organization because organizations would

00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,110
change over time and people can change

00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,000
over time yeah one thing that I've found

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,290
that this is a so more organizational

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,310
base any time that I was mentoring

00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:18,530
somebody is before the God started

00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,120
publicly I would do at least one review

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,310
after patch for Wednesday list but then

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,780
I would let them off and pollsters but I

00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,910
would warn them in advance that I knew

00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:27,710
that was issues wizard and they won't

00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,210
did not prepare my mail while they were

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,070
getting ready to censor and they went it

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,750
centers they know it follow-up but a

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,850
private email immediately saying the

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,560
maintainer of this type is going to

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,390
follow a respond in the following way

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,860
this reviewers want to wake up but he's

00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,060
going to respond this way this reviewers

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,150
want to wake up and is going to response

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,400
this way start peppering your answers

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,650
and your next revision of the patch now

00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,570
and try not surprised and when the come

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,340
back and react that way and I found this

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,530
was the most reliable way of getting a

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,270
person experienced which not only the

00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,220
development processes in general but not

00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:59,930
falling foul with maintain errs

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,190
otherwise if it's a maintainer and

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:03,260
dealing with it I haven't had experience

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,240
before I just do a/b testing on them do

00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,580
you like this no do you like that yes

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:15,620
okay I'll do more of that repeat repeat

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:17,900
until you get less snotty emails so Greg

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,190
just shouted out setting expectations I

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,990
think there were a couple of things that

00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,570
you've talked about here that were

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,480
really that that was the key point was

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,870
so a lot of human conflict comes out of

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,600
just misaligned expectations I think

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:36,510
setting those up front is a great idea

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,490
but but I want to repeat back to you

00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:44,190
what you're sure what your strategy was

00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:46,620
it was it was telling telling telling a

00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,570
submitter the the Scimitar patch these

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,309
are the review comments that I've logged

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,100
privately telling them I expect these to

00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:55,049
be addressed if I'm aware of the person

00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,760
before the sends the send the patch I'll

00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,080
warn them when they're about to send it

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:00,059
that there is going to be review

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,070
feedback is not necessarily positive and

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,630
then I make them post it anyway and then

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,190
I send them an email immediately saying

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,110
what the likely responses from different

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,240
maintained errs are different reviewers

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,159
is likely to be so they can start

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,289
prepping the responses in advance and

00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,940
set their expectations but if it's

00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,470
someone external and I see them post

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,610
something that I think is promising but

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,990
I think is going to file foul of the

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,990
maintainer what it will include in the

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,730
review is stuff that I don't necessarily

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,059
care about but I know the maintainer is

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,830
going to complain about and so then I

00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:31,080
usually be prefixed but something like

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,030
while this does not bother me and I

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,470
don't have any strong opinions one way

00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,090
or the other you're going to be asked

00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,770
the following so include that in the

00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,350
changelog or add a comment about it

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:43,289
whatever that is before the maintainer

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,990
against your your forwarding

00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:48,630
expectations that you've learned pretty

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:50,039
much this usually would only happen for

00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,159
something to consider very promising to

00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,260
begin with and but it's usually if I see

00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,690
does a patch could be delayed by a

00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,600
couple of weeks and then will fall foul

00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,340
of unwritten maintain a rule or usually

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,320
include that in the review process so

00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,770
well this is not necessarily maintainer

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,750
ship is if you are a reviewer and you

00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:11,850
know the person was going to follow all

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:18,299
of them included in your own review even

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:20,400
if you personally don't care I've

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:21,780
referred to injuries and he was the

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,610
perfect patch document to say hey I

00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,890
notice he did this and he may or may not

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:30,500
pick up on the thing that he said don't

00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:33,270
do the whole setting expectations and

00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,070
timelines for patch acceptance for

00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,260
contributors one thing I've noticed when

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:38,880
I send patches to random people is I

00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,950
never quite know when they picked it up

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,659
some people act some people don't

00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,980
having a feel for that how to tell when

00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,980
your patches actually in wood

00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,330
Liebling this is actually modeling

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,750
better behavior now he is he is now

00:32:51,330 --> 00:33:10,530
sending email to say I have pulled your

00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:13,380
tree which is wonderful understand well

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,900
you are being meeting this what's your

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:20,690
timeline how do you expect this to

00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:30,000
happen well I expect it to happen like

00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:32,039
now I mean so so so we can a problem sad

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,990
olaf sing and maybe i'll send out a test

00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,480
the test patch with describing these

00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,950
profile sections people can can a

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,990
connect the ones that we think we should

00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:42,510
encourage people to answer or not and

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,309
then i'll answer them for my subsystem

00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:46,230
as an example like here's here's the

00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:48,480
bambi dem answers and this kind of

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:52,620
encouraged people to to do the same for

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,409
their subsystems let me see if i

00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:00,120
understand well you have to meet an

00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:01,770
example or are you right just like the

00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,280
way you want it to be at the

00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:08,070
documentation yeah i mean if you submit

00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,290
for your subsystem i very likely do the

00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:12,359
same for media and of course i would

00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:15,899
change some things but i just copy your

00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:19,950
file to change things and put it so from

00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,780
media yes it sounds easy to do you

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:25,560
probably touched on this but does it

00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,450
make sense to automate have a subsystem

00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,399
specific check patch if you will i know

00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:31,200
it's a long shot but doesn't even make

00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,730
sense to start talking about it

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,869
well it means so I think that's I think

00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,800
that's phase two which is which is once

00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:42,000
you've kind of answered the basic

00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,740
questions is is now we get into sub sub

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,720
some substances may have incremental

00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,919
rules on top of the base submitting

00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,500
patches or coding style they may have

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,839
incremental things and so yeah I think I

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,460
think that's a that's a next and next

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,859
step but but certainly but certainly

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,550
there are checks patch issues that that

00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:59,680
are substance in specific and

00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,740
and some subsystems ignore some Waring's

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:16,810
and some all warnings as failures so

00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:19,270
yeah that is a good expectation I have

00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:20,860
two related questions one you said that

00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,710
there are some differences between

00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:25,570
subsystems and this is not going to be

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,700
like you must do this you can take some

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,310
parts so question is why do we want

00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,560
those differences because those are very

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,830
harmful at scale and we have watch

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,300
scales so we have basically

00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:39,930
non-replaceable maintained errs and

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:43,600
inconsistent contributor experience and

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:46,840
the second related one is about to link

00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:49,120
so what do you think about doing the

00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:53,230
tooling that does all of this because

00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,780
like most what you most of the things

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:59,080
that you mentioned are actually can be

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,780
automated and be supported by Julien and

00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,610
just so we don't have this issue of

00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,190
actually people need Ian to read this

00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,980
and follow the rules like all of the

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,070
like pass the tests you'd trust that

00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,740
reviewers they were sent in the patch

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,470
finding the maintainer and checking for

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,780
common problems checking for style and

00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:24,970
automating the the right integrations

00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:28,690
for everything and required tax and so

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:30,310
all this seems to be like I think I

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:34,870
think I think I think a lot of it a lot

00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:36,310
of it could be and and the zero day in

00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:39,340
particular does some of this checking

00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:41,470
and I know this is this is about some

00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:45,120
technique too but yeah like if somebody

00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:45,120
wanted to write write to only for this

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,500
but but before the difference is just

00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,100
documenting what the expectations are

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,370
you can you can compare compare notes

00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,370
and

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:09,460
we can say that just having it out there

00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:12,490
it's gonna be not a forcing function but

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,380
a force towards unifying like people in

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:15,820
fact if I can look the subsystem to see

00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,230
whether difference you can at least ask

00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,060
like what you can point them and say why

00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,160
are these different but today it's just

00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,020
like you don't know he's kind of assumed

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,609
that that tree kind of has that deadline

00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,530
the street kind of has that deadline we

00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:27,190
don't there's nothing that you can do

00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,570
line by line

00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,090
oh yeah we're different and maybe we can

00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,380
just fix that up so I think that could

00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,490
happen naturally once it's documented

00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:38,770
I'm gonna eject here we get eight

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:40,210
minutes okay two things one is an

00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,920
observation part of this is sort of

00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,859
maintainer to maintainer peer

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,260
information chain sharing the subsystem

00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:48,940
profiles is targeted a little bit more

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,760
towards contributors to know how to what

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,770
to expect out of a subsystem so tooling

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,380
that up and labeling the file once the

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,210
file is populated in a maintainer file

00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,590
so you can like if you have a patch you

00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:01,240
can run it against and figure out which

00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,970
files to read about what to expect about

00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:10,660
your patch that'd be a really neat nice

00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:12,970
way to list one you want others question

00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,030
mark on the bottom there is a one

00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,950
significant other thing is documentation

00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:22,240
you know is everything expects to be in

00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:24,280
kernel doc what other kinds of any kind

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,770
of number of things you might as a

00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,780
maintainer you might want to have in

00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,710
your documentation and inviting that

00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,950
kind of thing down I think would be

00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,180
enormously helpful but this I would I

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,520
would submit that this really is a

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,020
that's a down facing what you expect

00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,930
what you expect in contributors and this

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,510
is not a statement of what this this

00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:46,740
means this how you maintain this tree I

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:50,880
get me yeah there's a gray area there

00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:53,440
but I mean I can't can really put down a

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,000
policy besides don't documentary yes

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,000
document for maintaining

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,180
okay okay so the question I started

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,950
before was just to clarify where you

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,660
were recommending these to go would it

00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,460
belong in each subsystem individually

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:13,090
are you thinking about a global file I

00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:14,950
think I think it would be it'd be best

00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:18,750
to try to get these distributed out to

00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:20,680
the subsystems and and follow up on

00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,540
leanness have talked about breaking up

00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,580
maintainer as well and having it be

00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,010
local per system because it's easier for

00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:38,890
citizens to just change that file when

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:41,710
the policy changes when they get sound I

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:44,620
think enumeration the problem space is

00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:45,760
is worthwhile in itself there because

00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,320
there's always going to be new answers

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,450
about this like someone mentioned that

00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,830
some of this would be it should be done

00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:54,220
by tooling but not all things can be

00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:56,140
tooling for example in mmm there would

00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,720
be an emphasis on certain patches to

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,970
describe what the user visible effects

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,800
is when the CPU scheduler for example

00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,410
the same policy doesn't hold it's

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,790
usually about does the patch have

00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,080
semantic and cohered and sense or not so

00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,180
because there's always going to be new

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,510
answers I think it's reasonable to

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:15,280
enumerate the most common features that

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,560
a maintainer has and if a maintainer

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,740
decides to publish capabilities flag on

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,540
which things that he pays attention to

00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,730
another to pay attention to that's fine

00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,770
but it was always going to be there's

00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,140
always going to be counter examples and

00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:33,910
new answers so defining in terms of

00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:35,830
policy is risky but if the common modes

00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,530
of behavior our document is even if

00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:41,020
don't directly apply to a maintainer art

00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:45,070
for all situations for at least for new

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:47,410
people is useful to know what even any

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,000
of these rules are and then you just

00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,010
have to you just have to deal with the

00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:56,770
nuances on a case-by-case basis because

00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:59,500
it's never going to be nailed down this

00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:00,820
was kind of the overview of these these

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,080
are the things that a new maintainer the

00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,630
subsystem would want to pay attention to

00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,150
and like Mike for Fran be dim it's like

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,260
there's a way to submit vendor commands

00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,400
and all the vendors want to put all

00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,830
their magic in there

00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,480
and and Linux is a kind of a push back

00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:14,860
function to say no you got used to

00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,120
should work together but if a new

00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,440
maintainer came in they would just take

00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,900
the patches from all the vendors and not

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,910
even try to coordinate them so it's I

00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:23,800
think there's a space to say what are

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:28,030
the were some special rules that that

00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,470
that it advertisers - contributors that

00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,910
this is what the maintainer pays

00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,200
attention to but also is for the

00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:35,470
continuation if you hand it off to

00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:43,360
somebody else of watch out for this part

00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:45,040
of the code highlighting which one of

00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,660
these to pay attention to because it

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,130
might be a new maintainer or it might be

00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,660
a maintainer was with the changeable

00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,910
views or to mine changed or mind as to

00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:54,970
go along but even known what the problem

00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,260
space looks like like some talk about

00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:58,720
patches the pull request as you've

00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:02,500
enumerated here just having that list

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,050
about the likely behaviors of maintainer

00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:08,200
x' in general our document it has value

00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:11,850
in itself because once you actually

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,140
submit a patch then you've reached the

00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:15,850
implementation phase and you don't know

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,820
exactly how the materials want to react

00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:23,440
but at least enumerate them reduces the

00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:25,240
possibility of surprise I think I wanted

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,130
to reinforce what you're saying as a

00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,120
maintainer what would help me a lot is

00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:33,580
you have a template that typical rules

00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:35,740
that we follow and then let's say you

00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:39,220
know some people they have a code of

00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,480
conduct if it's rc7 of the kernel I want

00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,610
to be up update the code of conduct

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,470
without having this so it may be helpful

00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:47,320
for forward like the documentation file

00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,910
to have an external link right because

00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,160
these these have nothing to do with the

00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,110
current code they have to do the next

00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,080
patches you're sending right so they're

00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:58,780
really not tied in with so having a link

00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,880
to where the code of conduct is may be

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,460
helpful where you differ from the

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,140
default code of conduct because of your

00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:07,360
community that you deal with externally

00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,270
but I think that this is really helpful

00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,650
to have a template to look at because as

00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,850
a maintainer these are really good

00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:15,550
questions you don't always think of

00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:17,050
these as a maintainer and each community

00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,610
the test cases they run a little

00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,090
different so anyway the bottom line on

00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:23,780
this is that I would it would help

00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:25,970
if there was a template it had a point

00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,560
or typically to an external page that I

00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,740
can update for anything that differs

00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:34,340
from the template okay yeah I mean I

00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,780
like I'd like you to I think I mean I

00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,310
would encourage that to be the entry but

00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,910
yeah we could mean we could support

00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:42,920
whatever the local policy would be but

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:44,840
that these wouldn't change that much for

00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,000
them to be entry and you could go like

00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,910
if you wrote like a document that

00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,110
describes like the nuance document maybe

00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,340
that can about a tree but like these

00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,630
kind of one-line policy changes that

00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:58,520
could be handled as a maintainer spatch

00:43:53,630 --> 00:44:00,350
maybe we could do that entry but yeah I

00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,540
would soon offer the observation the

00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:04,010
kind of related what you're saying what

00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,410
you were saying as far as automated

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,610
tooling is concerned I don't think you

00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:10,040
want to be prescriptive about it what

00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:12,710
I've seen in the project I work in is

00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,690
that if you set up a set of tooling and

00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,100
it's a good baseline for new people

00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,690
coming in a lot of times the new people

00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,180
will adopt that that'll become sort of a

00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:23,180
de-facto standard but you don't need to

00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,410
prescribe that to existing individuals

00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,300
so having something like this is very

00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:28,490
very useful automating some of the

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,260
checks on it is also very useful and

00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,360
it'll organically become more

00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,700
standardized as people say hey that

00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,140
works and then they'll other maintainer

00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,460
can choose to adopt it or not if they

00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,800
have a pattern that works for them then

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:41,540
there's no need to change it but I would

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,180
say that automation is an opportunity to

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:58,040
begin to build some standardization so I

00:44:44,180 --> 00:45:00,470
would encourage that my opinion we

00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:03,550
should put some new tag at the

00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:08,290
maintainer file pointed to each specific

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:12,110
rule set for that subsystem and also

00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:14,780
teach get maintains how to get this

00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:18,440
document I mean if someone is meeting me

00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:20,510
attached I expect him to be aware that

00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,060
those are the routes has arrived to

00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:26,120
media forget maintainer should take that

00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:31,880
information and pass whatever you send

00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:33,110
me that okay attack the reference this

00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,280
is where the dark

00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,160
it could be intrigue it could be on a

00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:40,780
webpage but this this is this is the get

00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,780
the next level of maintainer stuff yep

00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,920
thank you very much let's thank the

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,920
