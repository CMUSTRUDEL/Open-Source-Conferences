Publication date: 2018-11-28
Playlist: Linux Plumbers Conference 2018
Description:

speaker:   Juri Lelli (Red Hat), Daniel Bristot de Oliveira (Red Hat)

The SCHED_DEADLINE scheduling policy is all but done. Even though it existed in mainline for several years, many features are yet to be implemented; some are already available as immature code, some others only exist as wishes.

In this talk Juri Lelli and Daniel Bristot De Oliveira will give the audience in-depth details of what’s missing, what’s under development and what might be desirable to have. The intent is to provide as much information as possible to people attending, so that a fruitful discussion might be held later on during hallway and micro conference sessions.

Examples of what is going to be presented are:

Non-root usage
CGroup support
Re-working RT Throttling to use DL servers
Better Priority Inheritance (AKA proxy execution)
Schedulability improvements
Better support for tracing
