Running out of memory on a host is a particularly nasty scenario. In the Linux kernel, if memory is being overcommitted, it results in the kernel out-of-memory (OOM) killer kicking in. In this talk, Daniel Xu will cover why the Linux kernel OOM killer is surprisingly ineffective and how oomd, a newly opensourced userspace OOM killer, does a more effective and reliable job. Not only does the switch from kernel space to userspace result a more flexible solution, but it also directly translates to better resource utilization. His talk will also do a deep dive into the Linux kernel changes and improvements necessary for oomd to operate.
