This proposal is to gather hackers interested in improving the thermal subsystem in the Linux Kernel and its interaction with hardware and userspace based policies. Nowadays, given the nature of the workloads and the wide spectrum of devices that Linux is used into, the peers interested in improving the thermal subsystem come from different backgrounds and with use cases of diverse thermal constrained systems, ranging from embedded devices to systems with high computing power. Despite the heterogeneity of software solutions to control thermals, the thermal subsystem is still core of many of them, including policies that rely on hardware configured thresholds, or interactions with firmware based control loops, or even policies that rely on userspace daemons. Therefore, this micro conference aims on gathering the thermal interested developers of the community to discuss further improvements of the Linux thermal subsystem.
