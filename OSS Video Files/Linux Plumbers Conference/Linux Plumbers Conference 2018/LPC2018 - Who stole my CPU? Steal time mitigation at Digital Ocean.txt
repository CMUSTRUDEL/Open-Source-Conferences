Steal time due to hypervisor overcommitment is a widespread and well-understood phenomena in virtualized environments. 
However, sometimes steal appears even when a hypervisor is not overcommitted. This talk will lay out our quest for better utilization of hypervisor hardware by reducing steal. We will talk about kernel heuristics causing it, how we handle disabling these heuristics by implementing a userspace daemon and the issues that arise from this.
