Title: LPC2018 - Performance and Scalability MC
Publication date: 2018-11-28
Playlist: Linux Plumbers Conference 2018
Description: 
	https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/2/sessions/24/#20181114

Proposed topics for this microconference include
 optimizations for mmap_sem range locking
 clearly defining what mmap_sem protects
 scalability of page allocation, zone-lock, and lru_lock
 swap scalability
 variable hotpatching (self-modifying code) multithreading kernel work
 improved workqueue interaction with CPU hotplug events
 proper (and optimized) cgroup accounting for workqueue threads
 automatically scaling the threshold values for per-CPU counters

We are also accepting additional topics. In particular, we are curious to hear about real-world bottlenecks that people are running into, as well as scalability work-in-progress that needs face-to-face discussion.
