Topics
Binding and Devicetree Source/DTB Validation: update and next steps
Binding specification format
Validation Process and Process
How to validate overlays
Devicetree Specification: update and next steps

Reducing devicetree memory and storage size

Overlays

Bootloader and Linux kernel implementation update
Remaining blockers and issues
Use cases
Devicetree compiler (dtc)

Next version of DTB/FDT format
Motivated by desire to replace metadata being encoded as normal data (metadata for overlays)
Other desired changes should be considered
Boot and Run-time Configuration
Pain points and needs
Multi-bus devices

Feedback from the trenches

how DTOs are used in embedded devices in practice
in U-Boot and Linux
in systems with FPGAs
Use of devicetrees in small code/data space (e.g. U-Boot SPL)

Connector node bindings

FPGA issues
