The main purpose of the Linux Plumbers 2018 Live kernel patching miniconference is to involve all stakeholders in open discussion about remaining issues that need to be solved in order to make Live patching of the Linux Kernel (more or less) feature complete.

The main purpose of the proposed miniconference is focusing on the features that have been proposed (some even with a preliminary implementation), but not yet finished, with the ultimate goal of sorting out the remaining issues.
