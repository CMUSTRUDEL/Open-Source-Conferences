The Linux Plumbers 2018 Testing and Fuzzing track focuses on advancing the current state of testing of the Linux Kernel.

Our objective is to gather leading developers of the kernel and itâ€™s related testing infrastructure and utilities in an attempt to advance the state of the various utilities in use (and possibly unify some of them), and the overall testing infrastructure of the kernel. We are hopeful that we could build on the experience of the participants of this MC to create solid plans for the upcoming year.

Plans for participants and talks will be similar to last year's (https://blog.linuxplumbersconf.org/2017/ocw/events/LPC2017/tracks/641).
