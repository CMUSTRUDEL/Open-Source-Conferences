BPF is one of the fastest emerging technologies of the Linux kernel and plays a major role in networking (XDP, tc/BPF, etc), tracing (kprobes, uprobes, tracepoints) and security (seccomp, landlock) thanks to its versatility and efficiency.

BPF has seen a lot of progress since last year's Plumbers conference and many of the discussed BPF tracing Microconference improvements have been tackled since then such as the introduction of BPF type format (BTF) to name one.

This year's BPF Microconference event focuses on the core BPF infrastructure as well as its subsystems, therefore topics proposed for this year's event include improving verifier scalability, next steps on BPF type format, dynamic tracing without on the fly compilation, string and loop support, reuse of host JITs for offloads, LRU heuristics and timers, syscall interception, microkernels, and many more.
