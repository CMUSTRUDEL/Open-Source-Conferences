Description: 
	Malloc for everyone and beyond NUMA

Speaker
 Jerome Glisse (Red Hat)

Description
With heterogeneous computing, program's data (range of virtual addresses) have to move to different physical memory during the lifetime of an application to keep it local to compute unit (CPU, GPU, FPGA, ...). NUMA have been the model used so far but it has assumptions that do not work with all the memory type we now have. This presentation will explore the various types of memory and how we can expose and use them through unified API.
