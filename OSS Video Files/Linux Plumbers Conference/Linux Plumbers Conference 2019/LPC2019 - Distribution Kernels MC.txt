Title: LPC2019 - Distribution Kernels MC
Publication date: 2019-09-17
Playlist: Linux Plumbers Conference 2019
Description: 
	Distribution Kernels MC

The upstream kernel community is where active kernel development happens but the majority of kernels deployed do not come directly from upstream but distributions. "Distribution" here can refer to a traditional Linux distribution such as Debian or Gentoo but also Android or a custom cloud distribution. The goal of this Microconference is to discuss common problems that arise when trying to maintain a kernel.

Expected topics
Backporting kernel patches and how to make it easier
Consuming the stable kernel trees
Automated testing for distributions
Managing ABIs
Distribution packaging/infrastructure
Cross distribution bug reporting and tracking
Common distribution kconfig
Distribution default settings
Which patch sets are distributions carrying?
More to be added based on CfP for this microconference

"Distribution kernel" is used in a very broad manner. If you maintain a kernel tree for use by others, we welcome you to come and share your experiences.

If you are interested in participating in this microconference and have topics to propose, please use the CfP process. More topics will be added based on CfP for this microconference.
