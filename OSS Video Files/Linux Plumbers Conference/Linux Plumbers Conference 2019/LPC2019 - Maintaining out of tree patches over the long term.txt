Description
The PREEMPT_RT patchset is the longest existing large patchset living outside the Linux kernel. Over the years, the realtime developers had to maintain several stable kernel versions of the patchset. This talk will present the lessons learned from this experience, including workflow, tooling and release management that has proven over time to scale. The workflow deals with upstream changes and changes to the patchset itself. Now that the PREEMPT_RT patchset is about the be merged upstream, we want to share our toolset and methods with others who may be able to benefit from our experience.

This talk is for people who want to maintain an external patchset with stable releases.
