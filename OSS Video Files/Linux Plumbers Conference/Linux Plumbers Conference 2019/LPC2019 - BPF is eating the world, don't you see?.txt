	BPF is eating the world, don't you see?

Description
The BPF VM in the kernel is being used in ever more scenarios where running a restricted, validated program in kernel space provides a super powerful mix of flexibility and performance which is transforming how a kernel work.

That creates challenges for developers, sysadmins and support engineers, having tools for observing what BPF programs are doing in the system is critical.

A lot has been done recently in improving tooling such as perf and bpftool to help with that, trying to make BPF fully supported for profiling, annotating, tracing, debugging.

But not all perf tools can be used with JITed BPF programs right now, areas that need work, such as putting probes and collecting variable contents as well as further utilizing BTF for annotation are areas that require interactions with developers to gather insights for further improvements so as to have the full perf toolchest available for use with BPF programs.

These recent advances and this quest for feedback about what to do next should be the topic of this talk.
