	Upstream Graphics: Too little, too late

Speaker
 Daniel Vetter (Intel)
Description
DRM is merging new drivers at a brisk pace, and with lima and panfrost to support ARM Mali GPUs the last obvious gap in not yet reverse-engineered hardware is getting closed. Plus new features, more contributors, more patches - in general upstream graphics is as healthy as it's never been before.

Time for some celebratory drinks, except this talk will be none of that. Now that we've achieved the goal of supporting all things graphics in upstream, the struggles didn't disappear. The promised land of "Upstream First" is leaving a rather sour aftertaste.

This talk will go through all the ways companies and teams have tried to ship graphics drivers using upstream, and how they all go wrong.

It will, unfortunately, not present solutions.
