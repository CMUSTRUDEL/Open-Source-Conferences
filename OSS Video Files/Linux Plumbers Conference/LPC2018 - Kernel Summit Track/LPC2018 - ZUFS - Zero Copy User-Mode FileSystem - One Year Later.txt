speaker:  Boaz Harrosh


One year after its inception there are real hardened FSs. 
Many innovative fixtures. But is it ready for upstream?

Few highlights:

ALL VFS api working including dax, mmap IOCTL xattrs ACLs ....
(Missing quota)
IO API changed (From last year)
Support for ASYNC operations
Support for both pmem and regular block devices
Support for private memory pools
ZTs multy-channel and dynamic channel allocation
And many more ...
In the talk I will give a short architectural and functional overview. Then will go over some of the leftover challenges.

And finally hope to engage in an open discussion of how this project should move forward to be accepted into the Kernel, gain more users and FS implementations.
