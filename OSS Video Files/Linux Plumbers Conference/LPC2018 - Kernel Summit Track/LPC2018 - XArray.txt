Now that the XArray is in, it's time to make use of it. I've got a git tree which converts every current user of the radix tree to the XArray as well as converting some users of the IDA to the XArray.

The XArray may also be a great replacement for a list_head in your data structure.

I can also talk about currently inappropriate uses for the XArray and what I might do in future to make the XArray useful for more users.
