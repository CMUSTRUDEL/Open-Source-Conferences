okay good morning everyone and welcome

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,220
to the lbcc networking chai

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,530
everyone hope had a safe and pleasant

00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,430
flight here to Vancouver however

00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,369
transport foccacia here first we have to

00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,960
do some thanks I first like to thank

00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,599
Facebook which are is the networking

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,550
track official sponsor and in particular

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,079
I'd like to thank Alexei and yes quite

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,300
some time ago they approached me and

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,840
they said we're thinking about doing a

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,739
networking track at OPC would you like

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,500
to do that

00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:49,620
they said that we would have complete

00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,910
control over the technical content and

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,800
they would set up everything as it is

00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,840
nice and set up here right now and I

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,460
decided that was a really good idea so

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,670
here we are and that's how why we're

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,680
here right now I'd also like to thank

00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,839
the LPC committee in particular Elena

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,460
because she was working directly with us

00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,430
the entire time to sort out all the

00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,350
issues that we had and even with her

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,060
busy schedule and things going on in her

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,610
life but she was able to attend to all

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,530
of our things and solve all of our

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,119
problems so very much appreciate all of

00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:26,740
her help so let's give a big thank you

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:28,299
to our sponsors and the LBC so what's

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,350
gonna happen during a networking track

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:32,079
well we're gonna have two days of

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,759
networking talks this talks about BPF

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,280
and there's gonna be some talks about

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,850
BPF and i think we even have some talks

00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,869
about BPF and also BPM more seriously

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:45,850
it's about a 50/50 split between VP of

00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:48,189
related talks and straight networking

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,619
talks I don't think that's neither a

00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:52,899
good nor bad thing some people may think

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:56,530
just too much emphasis on BPF I think

00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:58,029
that's BS the issue is we do have our

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,369
traditional networking stack we still

00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:04,329
have to water it and take care of it

00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:07,060
like a like a delicate flower but we do

00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:09,250
have BPF coming along and it's new

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,840
technology it needs a lot of work there

00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,060
is a lot of design decisions that need

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,560
to be made so it's the most active area

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,080
right now and that's all that displ it

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,640
between EPF and not B PDF talks mean

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,480
there's no other deeper meaning behind

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,950
it and if you really really like VP I've

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,870
stick around for Thursday cuz there will

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:31,330
be a full day track of BPF content

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,920
and one by Daniel and Alexis oh come on

00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,370
Thursday if you want to look at more of

00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,700
that kind of stuff some notes for the

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,129
speakers as I'm using right now we have

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,390
Daniels old laptop that is shared and

00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:46,150
all the speakers can make use of

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,980
we've synced all the presentation

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,739
materials on to the laptop that you can

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,209
use don't wait to the last second to

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,480
send me another copy of your updated

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:57,190
slides I may or may not ignore you you

00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,650
had quite a bit of time to submit things

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:02,349
and in fact technically speaking we're

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,880
way past the deadline at this point so

00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,049
like I said slides are preloaded you can

00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,180
just use this your laptop if you

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,209
absolutely want to you can use your own

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,739
laptop but get here before yours time

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,810
slot starts so you can get your laptop

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:15,370
working before you're not going to be

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,349
given extra time because you took you

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,480
couldn't get your laptop working or it

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,760
took too much time to do so our

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,019
schedules pretty tight we over run into

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,030
the brakes a little bit here and there

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,569
and even lunched to a certain extent so

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:31,180
please respect other people's time and

00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:36,670
don't take more of your own than you

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:38,739
need to then is allotted to you if you

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,940
get a bit of stage fright or you a

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:42,430
little bit of nervous while you're

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,190
giving a talk no problem we got the

00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,849
camel tanks here this take a shot of

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,389
this and you'll be feeling fine and

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:55,630
you'll be able to finish your

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:57,040
presentation with a smile I'd like to in

00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,019
particular thank the Technical Committee

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,280
this is a thankless job in a way because

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,730
you have to judge other people's work

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,630
you have to say no to people and turn

00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,160
people down who are giving high-quality

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,720
proposals to you because we just had so

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,880
much material submitted to us so I'd

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,720
like to thank in no particular order

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,430
Florian Danielle yes / and myself

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,780
so let's give a big round of applause

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:28,620
for the Technical Committee who did such

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:31,080
a great job it's so funny we always have

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,520
this situation that's everytime

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:37,830
proposals are out and about four or five

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,390
weeks before before the deadline and get

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,130
in a situation I'm like are we gonna

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,950
have enough material are we gonna have

00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,570
enough material and then about two or

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,850
three weeks and it's like a everyone

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,160
slow down we have more material than we

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,930
can use so we're constantly riding this

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,430
rollercoaster of are people gonna get

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,960
their act together and usually what

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,430
people do is they wait till the last

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,090
minute and that's where we have that big

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,520
rush towards the end so after I've

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:04,830
experienced this three or more times I

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,140
can guarantee you I'm never moving the

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,090
deadline for submissions for so you know

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,570
head of time that you're never gonna get

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,790
the opportunity to be allowed to have a

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,280
slide on the deadline it's gonna stick

00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,110
because you do have the material you do

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,880
you can't come up with it so please be

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,470
on time like to thank all these proposal

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,030
submitters whether you got accepted or

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,500
not we very much appreciate the time and

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,500
effort you put into submitting that

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,480
proposal and after the event is over

00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,640
sometime on Thursday we're gonna put

00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,160
links to all the materials for the

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,930
slides and the papers up on this URL at

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,490
the bottom

00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:43,050
it's the yura it's the the we've been

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,490
maintaining the site for a while it has

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,230
all the abstracts and everything already

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,750
daniel has been doing very good work on

00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:53,430
maintaining that web page so that's

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,440
great a little bit of some feedback I've

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,990
heard already that we're taking into

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,390
consideration for the whole process of

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,669
the proposal so far submissions seem

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,320
like a quarter of a black hole so like

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:05,580
you submit your proposal you don't get

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,160
an act or anything

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,000
that sucks we're sorry we should fix

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,250
that either we will as committee members

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,040
act at least one of us act your proposal

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,080
in the future or we'll set up an

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,970
automated mechanism for that somehow so

00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,980
we totally agree with this feedback and

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,140
we will fix that and we try to do we try

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,400
to get into that mode with the material

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,039
submissions we've been acting them as

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,050
much as we can some kind of way to

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,999
monitor the review process in some way

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,559
shape or form

00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:35,689
it's something we will look into I

00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,999
understand it's a very black box and an

00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:40,549
opaque process and it's kind of not fun

00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:42,549
to be at the other end sweating like a

00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:46,039
kid trying to get into university

00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:46,879
acceptance like what's going on are they

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,189
even looking at it

00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,319
today's did they get it when are they

00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,389
gonna give me a response what's going on

00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,129
so the lack of feedback is definitely

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:56,899
something we understand is an issue for

00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,110
people who submit proposals especially

00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:01,879
since you have to make travel plans

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,110
arrangements tell your management that

00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,789
you're gonna go to this conference and

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,929
give a presentation and whatnot so we

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,269
would definitely help you with that in

00:07:05,929 --> 00:07:10,729
the future submission deadline was early

00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:13,189
I'm sorry this is I thought I was doing

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:15,919
the right thing I tried to model the

00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:19,669
deadlines on last year's LPC timeframe

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,139
and I just it's too early I should I

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:24,619
should have done in a month or two

00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:26,059
afterwards so I'm sorry about that we

00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:28,219
definitely agree that this mission was

00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:31,119
too early and we'll adjust next time

00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:35,299
around so it's more favorable so it's

00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:37,249
having content which is more up-to-date

00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:40,819
at the time that the conference occurs

00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:43,009
so look at that sorted out that's the

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:45,739
end of what I have to say for getting

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:49,039
the sessions going at 9:20 we'll have

00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:50,539
yes burn company talk about xx DP so

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,849
we're looking very much forward to that

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,619
I wish everyone a great and fantastic

00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:57,229
time during LBC networking tract thank

know if there's anything that needs to

00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,209
be attended to or some feedback you'd

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,519
