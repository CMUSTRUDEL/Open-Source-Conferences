okay hi I'm Greg this is Chris mule off

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,080
we're here to talk about the code of

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,130
conduct the agenda is going to be me

00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,630
talking about the background what's

00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:21,110
going on introduced me to using

00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:24,710
questions as you all know we have a new

00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:27,309
code of conduct I do want to apologize

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,750
for the speed of it

00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,790
the background is John wrote a great

00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,840
Linux weekly news story about it about

00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,670
the summary of what happened at the

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,280
maintainer summit go see that for the

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,830
details but it came down to leanest and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,490
I needed to do this quickly for various

00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,330
reasons and so I rushed it I apologize

00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,060
for that

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,500
and I burned political capital but after

00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,660
that we tried to make up for that by

00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,800
talking to people and I talked to a lot

00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,570
of people and worked with a lot of

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,460
people to try and come up with the

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,620
interpretation document fixing any

00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,900
problems that we might have and set up

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,300
the ground rules and the work for how do

00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:05,420
we go forward so apologize for the

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,520
initial rush but it was necessary due to

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:11,300
on external factors that you read about

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,550
in John's post and this is something we

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,600
just had to go for from there so we have

00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,700
a code of conduct we have an

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,909
interpretation document we have an email

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,620
alias for problems with it we're setting

00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,500
up a group of people independent of the

00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,729
tab people criticize the tab was

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,140
responsible for the code of conduct but

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:28,940
the tab has always been responsible for

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,620
the code of conflict the past three

00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,080
years so it wasn't something that people

00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,659
didn't wasn't realizing they just didn't

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,940
realize we were doing this also a number

00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,970
of people confused the introductory

00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,470
process of the code of conflict with

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,640
when we did the GPL statement the GPL

00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,920
statement we shopped around for two

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,680
years the original code of conflict we

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,310
did in three weeks so one week versus

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,439
three weeks

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,830
yes it was faster but remember we did

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,540
this before and that was issues at that

00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,770
time as well so don't get this confused

00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,890
with the GPL statement because I know a

00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,320
number of people have so we have a code

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,549
of conflict email alias for setting up a

00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,019
board of people and we have mee-shee

00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:13,159
certified mediator to talk about things

00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:17,019
if you want to introduce yourself and

00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,019
say what you've done an open source and

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:25,130
as you can tell I'm a lawyer I really

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,810
need my love notes for everything but

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,959
let me start by congratulating you all

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,750
this is no small feat what you have

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,290
achieved I know that once you are at

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,090
that stage it seems insignificant and

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,700
what I'm talking about is I don't think

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,290
in the world there is any formal

00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,170
antagonist left who does not celebrate

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,160
your way of making software and what

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,459
you've taught the world about

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:55,769
collaboration and sharing so thank you

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:58,650
for what you all have done and I think

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,930
once you achieve that kind of global

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,870
success obviously your community has

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,220
going is going to grow in a in various

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,170
ways and you're going to welcome many

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,480
different people and that's why this

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,209
discussion is important and whatever

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,180
little role I can play to assist I'm

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,840
here my name is Misha Chaudhary

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,230
nobody ever confuses about my origin I

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,920
am originally from India I am based out

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,709
of New York I have been serving the

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,540
open-source community now for almost 12

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:36,000
years I have been a lawyer for various

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,799
foundations projects you've known free

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,790
software foundation in the past Apache

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,620
Software Foundation open SSL hopefully

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,970
most of the for most free software

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,359
projects I'm the legal director of

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,510
software freedom Law Center I have dealt

00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:56,459
with these issues and what I want to say

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,950
mostly is I think Greg set out something

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:01,290
very interesting to be excellent and

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,389
kind to each other and I want to say

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:11,250
that fairness and due process are not in

00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:15,780
conflict with kindness and if we can all

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:20,190
just start with trust and to understand

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,470
that we are here to listen carefully not

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:26,760
to make assumptions or judgments but

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,920
look into facts and find facts and just

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,720
be kind to each other and

00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,860
that's the guiding principle everything

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:40,590
else follows much more easily I am here

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:43,410
to help assist and understand and I one

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,600
thing I've understood is that your

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:48,210
community works because how great all of

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,610
you are and how much that trust matters

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,920
not only to the production of what you

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,350
make for the world but for being with

00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:02,940
each other and I will just help make

00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:06,210
that process better okay there was one

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,820
other thing about the process a lot of

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,470
people have tried talking about changing

00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,720
the code of conduct that we have if

00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,740
there are we took out one sentence that

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,050
didn't work very well

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,660
with our community I would encourage

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,520
everybody to work upstream because this

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,650
code of conduct is used by many hundreds

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,930
of other communities kubernetes lots of

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,820
other big ones so any changes that we

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,070
might need they would also need as well

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,840
originally we did look at using this

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,380
document when we wrote the code of

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,910
conflict

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,950
it wasn't mature enough it is mature

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,620
enough now but it can continue to get

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,410
better there's been complaints about the

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,270
people who wrote that document I will

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,460
publicly say me and Richard Stallman do

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,410
not get along but I agree with his

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,330
document so you can disagree with the

00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,000
person but you can agree with their work

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:55,320
that they contributed so our mess and I

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,120
have had great flame flowers so take it

00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,010
as what it is it's a good document that

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,290
works well for lots of communities it's

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,730
been worked on for many many years it

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,400
can continue to be worked on I think

00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,260
josh is he here has contributed patches

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,760
upstream for that so it's good so

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,670
continue to do that over time

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,590
if the upstream changes to take new

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,690
things that we think are valuable we

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,950
will take that as well but like Lena

00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,020
said let's let this sit for a while

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,160
let's see how this works let's go

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,390
forward from there we don't want to talk

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,520
about hypotheticals we're gonna talk

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,240
about real situations and that's

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,010
important so do we open up for questions

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,010
whose discussion yes Frank

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,560
okay so but I'll push back on that I

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,410
don't agree with Richard Stallman's

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,570
intent for what he does sometimes and us

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:03,560
as a kernel community have publicly no

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,060
but I'm saying I said the kernel

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:12,290
community have publicly said that too

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:38,960
but we like this document and that's

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:40,370
exactly where using this floor okay so

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,680
you're saying you don't agree with the

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,030
political intent behind the document

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:57,260
some people don't agree with political

00:07:44,030 --> 00:08:11,479
intent behind the document okay so then

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:13,430
do you if you agree with so then adopt

00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,300
the meritocracy argument and accept the

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,160
work for independent of the person no or

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:33,740
of the intent anyway we can agree to

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:36,080
disagree about that part okay so right

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,459
so okay so uh talk about the

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,849
interpretation document for a second um

00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:42,800
treat the code of conduct as the law and

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,969
then treat the interpretation document

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,650
of the interpretation of the law and how

00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:48,079
we need to apply that it's very common

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,540
in many governments or many countries

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:52,520
and I'll shout out to Thomas collection

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,440
err came up with this and push the idea

00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,510
and worked really hard on this he also

00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,730
shopped it around a lot all off to it

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,079
and Krista and Thomas did a lot of work

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,670
on this stuff so look at the

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:04,040
interpretation so if you feel that the

00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,990
interpretation needs to be changed in

00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,480
order to address issues let's talk about

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,220
that and we can we can go from there

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,650
but for now let's let it sit for a while

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,339
maybe few months cool down let's see how

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:19,180
that goes I understand your objection I

00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:19,180
acknowledge their Jackson but

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,230
okay so let's let this sit for a while

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,280
okay I'll say that let's let this sit

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,280
for a while hold on

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:28,740
I realize meritocracy was invented as a

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,740
critique of the idea it was a it was a

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,800
fake word it was it's not a good word as

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,210
far as how things go it was it was an

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,420
objection - it was an objection to

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:47,910
things right so right but there's also

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:49,350
social yes and so I don't think our

00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,110
document and hopefully our document

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,570
interpretation lays that out well if not

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,150
then I'd be glad to revisit it in a few

00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,380
months we do need to give it a shot but

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,380
I want to let now go just as

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,570
that's a great summary I agree with the

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,680
vast majority of that only I didn't say

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,889
all because I can't remember every

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,949
single thing

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:32,790
I do want to apologize for not giving

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:34,739
you a mic so if anybody where yeah the

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,369
square thing we sacrifice so that three

00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:39,839
of us could have mics but so if anyone

00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:42,139
didn't hear that there were a lot of

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,029
really good points in there about how we

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,949
we do deviate from upstream when we

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:50,549
consider it crucial and we are

00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:52,019
completely willing to one thing that we

00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:54,929
do want to underline is that it's not

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,609
crucial yet like we have no experiences

00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,739
that would make us need to deviate

00:13:56,609 --> 00:14:02,809
beyond where we already have because we

00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:04,829
did take out one sentence already so I

00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:12,209
all right hold on I'm gonna let no

00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:13,859
answer your boss Greg made mention

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,929
earlier and we've drawn comparisons

00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:17,759
between law but it'd be kind of cautious

00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:21,089
on using little terms cuz none of us are

00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,269
qualified however at the risk of making

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,790
a mess law also has the ideas of case

00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:29,939
studies or not case studies case law and

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,160
at the moment we have an implementation

00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:34,019
of aspect that may or may not work out

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,419
there are going to be examples of

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,040
getting this right in right around in

00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:39,619
the future and a big kind of a case that

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,610
some parts of the interpreter

00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:43,949
interpretation documentation it's going

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:47,489
to evolve based on a real-life scenario

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:51,029
where either was someone who was junior

00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:53,009
that ended up feeling excluded are that

00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:55,709
feedback to the cough was rampant are

00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:57,269
there's a major cultural hiccup and in

00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,980
terms of the culture hiccup cultural

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:04,259
hiccups can come from anywhere I am

00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:05,939
Irish and historically the way that we

00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,799
interact with each other and treat each

00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,179
other is incompatible with pretty much

00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,669
every other country out of there would

00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:13,289
cause a high degree of offence which

00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,839
basically means from the from absolute

00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:18,449
day one I had to mediate how I would

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,029
respond to people because they wouldn't

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:23,279
get us and our else too would just be

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,980
massive offence cost so it's not a case

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,109
that there is some kind that no matter

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,299
of where people are from there is going

00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:32,879
to be a cultural hiccup and eventually

00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:34,439
we're going to end up like with cases

00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,389
that have to be resolved and based on

00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:37,889
the outcome of that do post-mortem see

00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:40,420
how the interpretation document needs to

00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:43,210
be achieved and

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,940
in Ireland we actually have a specific

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,890
cautionary against making laws too

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,170
strict and it comes down to if we make a

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,600
law that our presidents decides to check

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,350
the constitutionality of they can send

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,090
that to a court and have an abstract

00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,650
interpretation of us and did what that

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,320
ruling is then finally can ever change

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,760
after it has only be enacted at once in

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,940
the history of the states whereas the

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,880
grounds is if we make a judgment based

00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,080
without example we end up tied into a

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,140
corner and we're screwed

00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,850
well the severity here is much less it

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,500
still is a case that we should waive

00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,940
some to little specific cases that we

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,320
need to respond to us it doesn't mean

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,880
whoever is involved in that case is

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,730
going to have a bad day and I feel sorry

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:32,710
for that future person I wish them the

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:35,290
best and I hope I'm not involved oh I

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,090
think you know meritocracy I'm going to

00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,510
change that world a little bit I'm going

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,880
to say I don't think that the intent if

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:46,450
we are giving the impression not somehow

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,400
we are going to water down the quality

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,380
of the code we accept I don't think that

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,300
is the case instead of saying come an

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,850
autocracy what we would say is we still

00:16:52,300 --> 00:17:00,670
want high quality code coming in we

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:03,190
might reject the code using polite

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,500
language and form language so that's

00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,240
that's how I am reviewing the code of

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,360
conduct I think it has always been the

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:13,120
case we have done that so we are kind of

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:17,610
formalizing what we did and you know

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,610
excluding some exceptions

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:37,640
so Frank I'm not ignoring you but I do

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:40,810
want to let other people talk from my

00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:44,810
side I guess the change that we've done

00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:48,170
by removing that paragraph and having

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:51,950
someone with law understanding we're

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:55,460
really really important I'm not quite

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:58,430
sure how the ex interpretation document

00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,290
would work on a legislation like the one

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,440
we have in Brazil would use a different

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:08,180
kind of legal system I'm not sure if we

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,570
have a minister strange as it would be

00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:16,430
in US but it is good to have at least

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,620
one document making things clear but I'm

00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:23,060
still a little bit worried and we had

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:26,450
one person from Europe asking us remove

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:29,000
it actually not really directly related

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,090
to the code of conduct but they asked us

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,070
for the right of before even and we had

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:41,390
to change one we have to remove on ebay

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:45,850
from one of our archives because of the

00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:50,200
right to be forgiven law in Europe and

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:53,600
my main concern is that someone may ask

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,710
us do the same at the can of get through

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,660
so I will speak to this a lots of

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,000
validation Oh about the basic issue is

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,530
right to be forgiven European data

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,230
collection laws forgotten forgive me

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,640
everybody's okay to be forgiven so Lois

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,960
foundation lawyers looked into this a

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,620
lot when that law went into effect and

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,420
it is they came to the conclusion that

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,390
everything that is contributed to the

00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,790
kernel is public and it does not have

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,650
that does not fall under that issue you

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:27,200
cannot go back and rewrite history in

00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:29,000
the girdle kernel logs you cannot go to

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,790
lead public email archives that people

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,110
voluntarily send things publicly so it

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,040
does not count so we do not have to

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,170
worry about that issue

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,060
as far as the legal interpretation goes

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:40,700
we had that

00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,880
a code of conduct or not many about a

00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,470
year ago so it's all it's not we do not

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,880
so if you have questions or people

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,500
talking about that talk to a technical

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,790
advisory board we'd be glad to do that

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,680
and put those people in contact with the

00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:53,060
lawyers that's our job here to do that

00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,040
and we've done that for other legal

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,930
issues that have come up talk to us

00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,010
we'll put in sure the right people those

00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,390
lawyers will talk to their lawyers

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,850
everybody will be happy

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:05,930
yeah you very rarely see lawyers give

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:07,460
legal advice on mailing lists you see a

00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,380
lot of people give legal advice on

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,160
mailing lists but somehow it always

00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:17,360
starts with but we certainly do

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,490
sympathize with people who have legal

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,220
concerns and uncertainty and we want to

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,140
help you connect those questions I'm

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,530
sure your companies can do a lot of this

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:37,030
for you if you just ask but if they

00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:37,030
refuse then we can rank

00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,920
it's the kind of the thing behind all of

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,170
this is the idea of creating a better

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,500
community more inclusiveness and you

00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:58,110
define your own inclusive making us work

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,970
better as a community and I know the

00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,460
precipitating event was very different

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,190
than that but we as a community really

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,670
do want to grow the community we want to

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,350
work well together and it seems like we

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,060
ought to be doing thinking about how to

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,460
do that independently of a code of

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,990
conduct so we can defer this discussion

00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,950
to later in the event if you want if

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,350
people want to talk about code of

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,180
conduct specifically so but one thing

00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:23,220
specifically that I've thought of is in

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,320
action item I'm on a couple of

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,140
conference committees and we could

00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,620
solicit speakers to talk about how do

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:35,730
you review in a way that's say non

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:37,380
confrontational and wait wait is

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,090
friendly to people and this goes back in

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,120
the 1980s and 90s in the commercial

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:45,200
environment we had classes on how to do

00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,100
code reviews in a way that wasn't really

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,620
slamming people it really was a

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,850
cooperative technical thing so I think

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,950
there are a lot of specific things we

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:57,810
could do and that's just one tiny

00:21:52,950 --> 00:22:00,450
example how can we promote that that

00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,770
sort of effort should the tab take on a

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,520
thing of talking to conference

00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:07,080
committees let's start a task force

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,340
because we're a commercial company we we

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,920
always send things off to a task force

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,590
or to a political committee or something

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,690
but is there something solid that we can

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:20,240
do to start solving the underlying

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:22,050
actual problem so yeah so sadly a lot

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,980
independent of what just happened a lot

00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,110
of people have been working on that

00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,520
issue on its own on the Linux Foundation

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,560
is gonna be announcing some initiatives

00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,510
they've been working on for many years

00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,540
I'd say go talk Dan Williams has a talk

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,760
tomorrow or today ones dance talk on the

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,490
maintainer document on how this

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,960
afternoon he's taken on the burden of

00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,420
tackling a lot of those issues with this

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,770
and because for years we talked about

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,690
how do you maintain errs interact with

00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,260
developers had developers expect for

00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,790
maintainer

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,740
what do maintains extraction developers

00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:50,370
how do we work together he's taken the

00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,890
the

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,420
Herculean task of trying to put out a

00:22:52,890 --> 00:23:11,850
initial document we're gonna iterate

00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:13,520
from there yes so I agree so great one

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,559
is um out Rishi Google Summer of Code

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,670
there's some other stuff that's coming

00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,320
programs like that I'm signed up to be a

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,910
mentor if you're not sign up to

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:35,550
volunteer for just reviewing patches

00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:38,309
right so that's so talk to Dan so he's

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,809
doing that so he's working on proposing

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,570
that it's been in the under the works

00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:44,700
for like a year now so I think the point

00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,960
about supporting newbies is fantastic

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,460
and we should absolutely continue to do

00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,679
this but it's also important to remember

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,300
that we as maintainer Xand experienced

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,830
developers need to make sure we are

00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,470
treating with each other as respect as

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,030
well and make sure is that just because

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,030
we should we should know better doesn't

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,860
mean we can't always we always make

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:03,809
mistakes and making sure is is that it's

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,780
ultimately as maintainers we are setting

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,340
the example we once mmm beget newcomers

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,929
to the community to follow later as well

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,920
so that's something to keep in mind when

00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,809
thinking about these things as well but

00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,370
yes absolutely supporting new people and

00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:16,320
supporting ourselves and existing

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,540
maintainer Xand I'd love to see that the

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,730
maintainer documents include supporting

00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,830
other maintainer x' as well so yeah and

00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,610
so I I mean I got to play Lina's for a

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:29,220
month it sucks

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:31,470
we as maintainer x' everybody does

00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:33,390
something differently everybody sent a

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,880
different poll request everybody I had a

00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,290
it was not fun I oscillators how he did

00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,360
it he said he has a bunch of macros he

00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,720
said it's not fun we can make it nicer

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,210
to Lina's it'll be nicer to us don't do

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,010
and people push the boundaries with me

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:50,130
don't push boundaries you know sometimes

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,450
like that so even maintainer x' can be

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,160
nicer to the other maintainer so they

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,780
interact with and i think we need to

00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:01,830
codify a little bit out and make things

00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:03,390
easier okay yeah I mean a little bit

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,540
what Frank said we have been optimizing

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,130
for a long time to make sure that the

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,530
people who stick around are the people

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,970
we care about code from usually when you

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,530
come with a patch we care about the

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,480
quality of the patch but traditionally

00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,710
we also care a lot about whether you're

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,540
gonna be around if there's a problem

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,410
with this code you know six months from

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,870
now or something like that

00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:25,320
and I think there's a lot of groups that

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:26,790
are working on improving tools improving

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,520
various things we have deserted a

00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,690
builder we have kernel CI we have a lot

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,700
of things going on where it's going to

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,550
be easier and easier to make sure that

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,660
the code is decent when it goes in and

00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,630
maybe relieved a little bit of the

00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,300
pressure of making sure that you're

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,650
hanging around and looking after the

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,190
code and I think that's something that

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,800
can greatly broaden a contributor base

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,020
but it's not easy to do and I think

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,470
we're chipping away at it and it's

00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,470
heading in the right direction

00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,200
[Music]

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,530
like other things into those aspects of

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,780
this we need to be wary of and in this

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,920
case it's the emphasis on individual

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,050
responsibilities rather than the

00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,820
delegation of words to perceive the

00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,710
turocy base the technical advisory

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,630
boards maintain or otherwise maintain

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:20,980
our load is high there was aside from

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,810
aside from it adding to the load that

00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:26,470
will cause issues and in itself if they

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:28,780
are deemed to be responsible but at the

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,660
end of the day we have individual

00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,100
responsibilities as well and the fact of

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,540
the matter is that there is always going

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:37,270
to be elements of the community that are

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,950
temperamentally unsuited to mentor are

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,320
encouraged new people to contribution

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,850
this is not a rifle round sometimes it

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,870
simply is and it's best to acknowledge

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,630
that some people are temperamentally

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,130
unsuited to act in a mentorship role in

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,080
the event that you see cases where

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:53,590
someone is getting crucified in a revue

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,840
and even if it's even if it's friendly

00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:59,590
and focusing completely on the technical

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,300
merits of it I you have an individual

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:03,190
responsibility intervene and I'll give

00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,590
an example you can even in a very

00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:09,760
friendly fashion tear a patch apart

00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:13,180
without explaining even once what you

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,400
would accept as being correct as an

00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,650
alternative implementation are some

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,790
other way of doing it so you can be very

00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,500
friendly but the passive-aggressive

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,450
nature of it doesn't necessarily help

00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,280
the person complaining to maintainer

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:25,840
Zarda technical advice reports doesn't

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,800
help in the event you see something like

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,390
that and you feel that you are

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,240
temperamentally suited to have the

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,580
person intervene I dance the reviews

00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:36,550
suggested a person was they might do

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,250
differently how it work otherwise engage

00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:42,670
the person who did the initial review

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,430
and try and gauge them to say what is it

00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,990
that you would accept which parts of

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,210
this are actually wrong is this like a

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,240
workload that you would evaluate is it a

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,650
styling issue is there some other part

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,420
that you feel she needs be cleaned up

00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,030
first if you have more experience than

00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,490
the person getting hammered intervene

00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,840
and through your review process extract

00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,840
from the temperamentally on suited

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,230
person what it is that a new person

00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,370
needs to succeed I don't think it's fair

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,720
to say the maintainers

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,490
fix that are the technical advisory

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,540
board fixes if you've opinions on how it

00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:18,760
should be fixed review help don't

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,720
complain and reach out if I'm acting

00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,400
snarky call me on privately but or you

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,770
can do publicly if I'm saying reach out

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,030
and intervene if you have the time and

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:43,390
notice it because that's the best way to

00:28:28,030 --> 00:29:09,520
defuse issues yeah that's basically what

00:28:43,390 --> 00:29:12,010
I was going to say I mean sometimes we

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,460
don't necessarily have the capacity the

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:17,620
time to mentor if there is a patch and

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,420
it is suboptimal sometimes I don't know

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,580
the answer sometimes I won't know the

00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,500
answer until I go and try to implement

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:27,100
it myself three times and work out which

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,320
one I hate least and sometimes it's hard

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,150
to give the constructive feedback

00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,650
sometimes it's easy and sometimes people

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,440
fail to do so when they should um that's

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,300
absolutely right but also sometimes you

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,250
can't actually say how you want to see

00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:51,429
it done you can only say I don't like

00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:52,870
this even if it's a case your counter

00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:55,150
situation where you feel like that and

00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,910
you end up having to say I'm not

00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:59,050
comfortable with this but I not sure how

00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,059
to explain how it could be done

00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,860
differently until I can try at least

00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:04,900
it's include that because then at least

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,970
the person knows at the stand one thing

00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,130
would have seen where people ended up

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,660
falling down was because people aren't

00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:13,000
come for what they're doing they didn't

00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:14,410
clarify that and the less the person

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,059
involved work from another six to nine

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:18,280
months honors in which case they said no

00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,720
and had a more coherent response and in

00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,300
my mind's that strong someone down the

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,759
halls now starters kind of interfering

00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,709
when

00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:26,899
see something like that happen it's a

00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:29,029
fortunate but again the central point

00:30:26,899 --> 00:30:30,949
was there's a degree of individual

00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:32,239
responsibility if you see behavior like

00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:34,519
this and you think that it should be

00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:37,039
done differently and you're a member of

00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,359
community get involved don't bother to

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,859
saying that the maintainer should do

00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,849
something or the technically advisory

00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,440
board to do something because that

00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:44,329
doesn't scale if you've strong opinions

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,669
about things should be done correctly do

00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:48,349
it true example if you see someone who

00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:51,679
is temperamental even suitable tearing

00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:53,719
somebody apart don't necessarily

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,299
challenge that person instead rewrite

00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:58,819
the review in a way that it's consumable

00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,129
for somebody that's definitely good

00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:03,379
advice and I think the one thing that

00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:08,809
this doc and this change is made clear

00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:10,969
is that everybody is okay to behave bad

00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:14,389
behavior isn't expected or accepted by

00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:16,009
anybody another thing to reply and

00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:18,619
comment a little bit on what David was

00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,599
saying if you're in a position where

00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:22,699
you're the only one who can review the

00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,259
code for your subsystem series as a

00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:27,589
growing opportunity for somebody else

00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,089
and try to find find somebody else they

00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:31,279
can deal with this I mean it's how we

00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:32,839
all end up spinning up new maintainer is

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,029
to help you out and stuff like that

00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,679
there are places of the kernel where

00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:39,319
nobody else wants to touch it then you

00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,979
might be on the hook of course it's

00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:44,989
always hard but I mean this is also how

00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:47,659
we grow new maintainer xand and you know

00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:49,459
see it as as an opportunity for that but

00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:52,579
I do want to put in a plug for Dan

00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:55,299
Williams maintainer sky talk you know a

00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:57,919
lot of these it's really interesting how

00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:01,309
intertwined code of conduct issues and

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,109
maintainer issues are and one of the

00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:05,599
really great things about writing down

00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:07,069
the maintainer guide is I'm hoping it

00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,169
will give us a chance to look at it and

00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,459
say this is ridiculous I can't believe

00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:12,409
we've been working this way for this

00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:16,819
long how in the world is this function

00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:18,829
at all and then once we have those

00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:20,839
moments where we read it and say it out

00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:22,849
loud and say wow that's just crazy um

00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,799
you know those are the places that we

00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:27,349
can examine and say this is how we make

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,029
being a maintainer much easier and

00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:31,969
hopefully by doing that we make it much

00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:35,229
easier to be a contributor as well so

00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:35,229
that's a plug for Dan's talk

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,010
yeah just as a general comment one thing

00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,890
a mentor taught me when I was first

00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:50,040
starting to take on leadership roles in

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,809
the IETF which like the Linux kernel

00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,350
development community is a volunteer

00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:58,620
organization is ultimately as a leader

00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:01,710
in a volunteer organization your only

00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,800
power is to say no right you can't

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:07,860
compel other people to do things and the

00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,860
corollary to that is if you are looking

00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:14,820
for something to happen asking a leader

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,460
to make XYZ happen generally won't work

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,800
right if you want it to happen you

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,630
should do it yourself right or try to

00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,330
find other people to work with you to

00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:27,510
make something happen and we may know

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:30,270
this in the language sounds great send a

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:33,000
patch right so when people say yes you

00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,670
know what is the tab doing to you know

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,860
reach out more to newbies beyond

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,280
outreach it's like if you've got a great

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:45,059
idea you know try and do it now if you

00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:47,160
need help getting resources the tab and

00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,040
other leaders may be able to help you

00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,980
get resources right but that's different

00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:54,360
from asking people to actually do

00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:00,600
something that you really want to see

00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:02,400
happen right it's not always resources

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,870
in some cases you might know what you

00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,280
want to do you don't know how to do it

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,710
and that's another type of resource

00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:12,149
right you don't have to have all the

00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:13,919
answers and so I want to take Ted's

00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:16,290
comment back to the code of conduct for

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,879
just a second in general I think there

00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,100
are actually four different answers that

00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:24,090
people have two patches the first one is

00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:26,429
yes the second one is no the third one

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,889
is no with a big list of reasons of how

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:30,870
you want it to look different and the

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:32,220
fourth one is no with the list of

00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,770
reasons of how you want it different and

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,909
a long story about how the patch is

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,659
terrible and the author should

00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,909
reconsider their life choices and so

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,169
that's the one I want to get rid of

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:45,149
that's the one that doesn't really add

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:47,100
anything to the community and from a

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:48,480
code of conduct point of view if we can

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,359
accomplish that

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,369
we're much better off than we were so I

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,109
missed you and went out first I mean I

00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:56,519
first of following up I think on heads

00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:57,930
and kind of your point the other thing

00:34:56,519 --> 00:35:00,239
to keep in mind is that with the code of

00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,650
conduct I've seen a quite a few talks

00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,569
about code of conduct and enforcement

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,130
and really the thing is is that most

00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,630
code of conduct issues are going to be

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,609
things that we can ultimately handle

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:10,529
among ourselves and it's not going to

00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:12,480
require escalation and it's going to be

00:35:10,529 --> 00:35:15,029
using our own good judgment that we

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,259
already have as the kernel community to

00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,759
be able to solve these types of problems

00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:19,829
and the purpose of the code of conduct

00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:21,720
is to establish what we as a kernel

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:24,930
community value and then for the more

00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,059
serious issues which which may arrive

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,349
someday hopefully not but you have to

00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:29,940
plan for those things and so the purpose

00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:32,130
of the code of conduct is a plan for

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:36,450
both the every day to day stuff and the

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:41,390
worst possible outcomes which yeah yeah

00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,390
I I agree I hope you never need me and

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:46,829
mostly my endeavor is actually not to

00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,259
bill you or do anything but be redundant

00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:50,730
Bert I want to support one thing is that

00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:52,470
having watched so many different

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:54,299
projects each project of course works

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,989
differently based on what their licenses

00:35:54,299 --> 00:36:02,700
are or but each community has its own

00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:05,249
features and and I think that each of

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,230
you each community figures out how they

00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:09,089
want to resolve these issues and what is

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,160
the example they want to set what are

00:36:09,089 --> 00:36:14,910
the things they want to do and mostly

00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,680
it's not these kind of code of conduct

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:19,200
are not set in stone because these are

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,299
these may be your Constitution but you

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,160
have the ability to amend or change it

00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:24,809
it's not that we are taking it out to a

00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,849
court and trying to tell them ok there

00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:29,009
is an interpretation that's why the

00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:31,019
community itself decides what they want

00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:33,239
how they want what the terms are and

00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:35,730
also the resolution the more you can

00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:39,299
resolve it the better it works out for

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:43,200
each of you and I'm there but as I said

00:36:39,299 --> 00:36:45,119
hopefully I'm never required and I think

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,369
that's an important point where the

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,589
committee contact point isn't

00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,539
necessarily just the police in contact

00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:53,069
when somebody's committed a crime if

00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:55,049
you're a maintainer if you see something

00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:57,509
going on and you need to ask somebody

00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:59,640
hey how would I deal with this can you

00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,220
help me out I don't want this to happen

00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,650
what can

00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,599
do reach out be clear that it's not

00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,310
necessarily a violation report than you

00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,900
don't want it investigated but reach out

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:12,430
for help I mean it's a resource that's

00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:15,010
there for everybody okay yes was first

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:16,390
sorry so I was I've been sitting here

00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,660
listening and I agree with a lot of

00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:22,150
pretty much all of it there's one corner

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,710
case that keeps hitting my mind which I

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,690
think we're kind of ignoring in all this

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,940
because we keep talking about this might

00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,349
be a little bit of a tangent we keep

00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,420
talking about how we need to be helpful

00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:33,819
and friendly and try and encourage

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:37,020
people to do the right thing but we have

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:39,040
historically seen this problematic

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,680
contributors who don't want to listen

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,410
and the downright trolls I mean we all

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,030
remember certain mr. krauser and how do

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,470
we cope with that because some of these

00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,150
people are deliberately trying to

00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:52,690
basically piss people off and provoke

00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:54,339
and and I just don't see a there's a lot

00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,900
of talk about how to cope with that in a

00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:59,109
constructive way because there are times

00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:01,119
where you just either can't answer or

00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,240
simply you have to tell the person to

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,829
bugger off and don't come back

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,900
that isn't that's independent of the

00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:10,240
code of conduct and we've handled that

00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:13,210
independently for years on our own I

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,819
mean the issue case she brought up we

00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,099
got in band and then band again and the

00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:19,420
band again and then again as they kept

00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:22,510
changing email dresses and he's back

00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,780
he's banned again last a couple weeks

00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:28,720
ago so it's just that's independent so

00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,329
it's a quarter case it's annoying talk

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,230
to us we'll take care of it it's it's

00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:34,030
pretty cut and dry

00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:36,220
it's natural the reason I'm bringing it

00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,780
up is those to be keep talking about how

00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:40,180
we should always be positive in our no

00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,250
no I totally agree with that right it's

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,540
just that we we have to accept that

00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,210
there are those cases where we have to

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,800
sort of use we already tool and if

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:54,390
anybody wants a copy of my kill file I'm

00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:56,770
welcome to go to it's good so before we

00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,710
go any more we only have I think four

00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:03,119
minutes left so I do want to encourage

00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,119
yep yep

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:15,000
so I have I have dealt with a fair

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:18,010
number of trolls in my days one of the

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,620
most effective ways of dealing with

00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:24,790
trolls is to not let them provoke you

00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:27,100
and instead don't also don't let them

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,680
pull you into a debate because that's

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:34,150
what they want they want to waste your

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,510
time and what you know in in case of one

00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,850
particular one particular troll started

00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:46,270
responding to each one of his emails

00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:48,520
with dear wrong but no I think the only

00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,800
thing here is the troll example was kind

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,060
of the extreme but there's also these we

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,160
have also seen problems with

00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,810
contributors who have worked on

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,100
something I mean the classic is somebody

00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,270
in a corporate environment works on

00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,800
something for a couple of years doing

00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,880
their things their way and then they

00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,470
come to the mailing list and everything

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,610
told we're not going to take this you

00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,770
are on the wrong path you should have

00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,660
talked to us two years ago and they just

00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,950
keep pushing it and I know that is

00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,940
something that has pissed Alina's off in

00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,500
the past yeah and it'll happen again

00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,090
but that's just learning to work with

00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,170
our community we're saying in the

00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,330
interpretation document we are not

00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:23,500
changing how we work or address that we

00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:27,420
just will tell them nicely or we will

00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:34,030
just it's okay to just not respond

00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:36,460
sometimes after responding I said yes

00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:45,160
yes there is the law of diminishing

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:47,260
returns Nager really quick I saw a

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,710
pattern that were people focusing too

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,700
much on enforcement or not enforcement

00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,290
it's two black-and-whites

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,700
I know we're all binary and thinking but

00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,490
it's too black and whites never forget

00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,550
that the escalation is an option if you

00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:02,910
see something going wrong if you get the

00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:05,140
life choices review this Chris used

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,720
anyone doesn't either maintainer as as

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,180
can step in and rewrite that review in

00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:12,130
an our life choices fashion and that

00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,600
means that you will end up taking some

00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,430
of the blowback from the person who's

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,710
temperamentally on susan's but

00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:21,849
least the aggression will be spread and

00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,319
probably by somebody who already knows

00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:25,960
what shape the aggression is going to be

00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:27,730
it's not nice but the escalation is a

00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:34,990
prayer for a path to enforcement or not

00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:38,920
enforcement yes No so yeah definitely so

00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:41,589
one thing I have used is in the past is

00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:43,480
just sit on an email if you get an email

00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:45,730
that's negative just sit on it for a bit

00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,010
don't have to respond right away so if

00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,690
you respond right away you end up you

00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:53,710
and this escalating not deescalate

00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:57,400
accept and sometimes um I have used this

00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:59,319
lot many of you I came to support and

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,170
say hey what should I how should I

00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:04,300
depart as fun am i doing should I should

00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:08,800
I have phrased my email differently so

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:12,220
lean on support so I you know I'm I'm I

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,050
can help if anybody wants you know get

00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:16,119
stressed out and say hey should I have

00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,520
done something differently just send me

00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:29,589
an email probably I is that technique a

00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:31,660
lot - so there are people who there are

00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:34,210
maybe people who want to go to say

00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,510
Arne's end of talk 19 years to go in

00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:40,720
pavilion a B or the embedded thermal use

00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:43,630
cases so if people need to run I'm sure

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,099
we can stick around but I don't want to

00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:50,080
run over and disturb other tracks thank

00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:55,880
you very much everybody

00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,880
