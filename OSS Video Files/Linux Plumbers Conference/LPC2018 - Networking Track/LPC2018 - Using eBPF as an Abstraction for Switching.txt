eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) has been shown to be a flexible
kernel construct used for a variety of use cases, such as load balancing,
intrusion detection systems (IDS), tracing and many others. One such
emerging use case revolves around the proposal made by William Tu for
the use of eBPF as a data path for Open vSwitch. However, there are
broader switching use cases developing around the use of eBPF capable
hardware. This talk is designed to explore the bottlenecks that exist in
generalising the application of eBPF further to both container switching as
well as physical switching.

Topics that will be covered include proposals for container isolation through
the use of features such as programmable RSS, the viability of physical
switching using eBPF capable hardware as well as integrations with other
subsystems or additional helper functions which may improve the possible
functionality.
