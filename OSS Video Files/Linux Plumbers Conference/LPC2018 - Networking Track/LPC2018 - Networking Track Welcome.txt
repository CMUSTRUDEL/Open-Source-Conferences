okay good morning everyone and welcome

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,230
to the lbcc networking jack everyone i

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,690
hope had a safe and pleasant flight here

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,490
to vancouver however transport foccacia

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:22,349
here first we have to do some thanks i

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,300
first like to thank facebook which are

00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:26,400
is the networking track official sponsor

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:31,380
and in particular I'd like to thank

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,810
Alexi and yes quite some time ago they

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,100
approached me and they said we're

00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,850
thinking about doing a networking track

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,610
at OPC would you like to do that

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,730
they said that we would have complete

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,020
control over the technical content and

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,910
they would set up everything as it is

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,100
nice and set up here right now and I

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,570
decided that was a really good idea so

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,780
here we are and that's how why we're

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,789
here right now I'd also like to thank

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,829
the LPC committee in particular Elena

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,570
because she was working directly with us

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,539
the entire time to sort out all the

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,460
issues that we had and even with her

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,170
busy schedule and things going on in her

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,720
life but she was able to attend to all

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,640
of our things and solve all of our

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,229
problems so very much appreciate all of

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,460
her help so let's give a big thank you

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,460
to our sponsors in the LBC

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,020
so what's gonna happen during a

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,570
networking track well we're gonna have

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,490
two days of networking talks this talks

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,070
about BPF and there's gonna be some

00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:33,549
talks about BPF and i think we even have

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:36,700
some talks about BPF and also BPM more

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:39,280
seriously it's about a 50/50 split

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,979
between EPF related talks and straight

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,619
networking talks I don't think that's

00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:46,540
neither a good nor bad thing some people

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:50,440
may think just too much emphasis on BPF

00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,940
I think that's BS the issue is we do

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,340
have our traditional networking stack we

00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,300
still have to water it and take care of

00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:01,149
it like a like a delicate flower but we

00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,399
do have BPF coming along and it's new

00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:04,990
technology it needs a lot of work there

00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,149
is a lot of design decisions that need

00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,649
to be made so it's the most active area

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,170
right now and that's all that this split

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:12,640
between VP F and not B PDF talks me

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,600
there's no other deeper meaning behind

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,709
it and if you really really like BP I've

00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,720
stick around for Thursday because

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:24,190
there'll be a full day track of BPF

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,440
content with Dan and run by Daniel and

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,739
Alexis oh come on Thursday if you want

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,100
to look at more of that kind of stuff

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,049
some notes for the speakers as I'm using

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,970
right now we have Daniel's old laptop

00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,510
that is shared and all the speakers can

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,269
make use of

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:42,100
we've synched all the presentation

00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:44,829
materials onto the laptop that you can

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,329
use don't wait to the last second to

00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:49,600
send me another copy of your updated

00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:51,250
slides I may or may not ignore you you

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,769
had quite a bit of time to submit things

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:56,470
and in fact technically speaking we're

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,880
way past the deadline at this point so

00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,140
like I said slides are pre-loaded you

00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,299
can just use the share laptop if you

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,329
absolutely want to you can use your own

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,650
laptop but get here before yours time

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,930
slot starts so you can get your laptop

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,459
working before you're not going to be

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,470
given extra time because you took you

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,989
couldn't get your laptop working or it

00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,880
took too much time to do so our

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,140
schedules pretty tight we over run into

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,950
the breaks a little bit here and there

00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,829
and even lunched

00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:24,190
to a certain extent so please respect

00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,500
other people's time and don't take more

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:31,130
of your own than you need to then is a

00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,230
lot of to you if you get

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,340
bit of stage fright or you a little bit

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,100
of nervous while you're giving you a

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,610
talk no problem we got the Gamal Danks

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,850
here

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,250
this I'd take a shot of this and you'll

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,630
be feeling fine and you'll be able to

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,630
finish your presentation with a smile

00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,040
I'd like to in particular thank the

00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,600
Technical Committee this is a thankless

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,700
job in a way because you have the judge

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,150
other people's work you have to say no

00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:02,030
to people and turn people down who are

00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,560
giving high quality proposals to you

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,600
because we just had so much material

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,820
submitted to us so I'd like to thank in

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:13,430
no particular order

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:14,540
Florian Danielle yes / and myself so

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,890
let's give her a big round of applause

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:22,730
for the technical committee who did such

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:25,250
a great job it's so funny we always have

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:29,630
this situation that's every time

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:31,940
proposals are out and about four or five

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,470
weeks before before the deadline I get

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,240
in a situation I'm like are we gonna

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,060
have enough material are we gonna have

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,680
enough material and then about two or

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,960
three weeks and it's like a everyone

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,270
slow down we have more material than we

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,040
can use so we're constantly riding this

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,540
rollercoaster of are people gonna get

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,070
their act together and usually what

00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,540
people do is they wait till the last

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,200
minute and that's where we have that big

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,630
rush towards the end so after I've

00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,940
experienced this three or more times I

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,430
can guarantee you I'm never moving the

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,170
deadline for submissions for so you know

00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,680
head of time that you're never gonna get

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,900
the opportunity to be allowed to have a

00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,390
slide on the deadline it's gonna stick

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,220
because you do have the material you do

00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,990
you can't come up with it so please be

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:19,040
on time I like to thank all these

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,780
proposal submitters whether you got

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,010
accepted or not we very much appreciate

00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,920
the time and effort you put into

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,140
submitting that proposal and after the

00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,570
event is over sometime on Thursday we're

00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,970
gonna put links to all the materials for

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,040
the slides and the papers up on this URL

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,720
at the bottom

00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,160
it's the yura it's the the we've been

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,600
maintaining the site for a while it has

00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,310
all the abstracts and everything already

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,770
daniel has been doing very good work on

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,880
maintaining that web page so that's

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,810
great

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,580
a little bit of some feedback I've heard

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,070
already that we're taking into

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,500
consideration for the whole process of

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,780
the proposal so far submissions seem

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,430
like a quarter of a black hole so like

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,890
you submit your proposal you don't get

00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,460
an act or anything that sucks

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:06,950
we're sorry we should fix that either we

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,570
will as committee members act at least

00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,480
one of us act your proposal in the

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,820
future or we'll set up an automated

00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,650
mechanism for that somehow so we totally

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,840
agree with this feedback and we will fix

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,670
that and we try to do we try to get into

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,580
that mode with the material submissions

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,230
we've been acting them as much as we can

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:26,300
some kind of way to monitor the review

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,370
process in some way shape or form it's

00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,380
something we will look into I understand

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,600
it's a very black box and opaque process

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,450
and it's kind of not fun to be at the

00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:39,080
other end sweating like a kid trying to

00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:40,760
get into university acceptance like

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,000
what's going on are they even looking at

00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,670
it

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,250
did they get it when are they gonna give

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,840
me a response what's going on so the

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,820
lack of feedback is definitely something

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,250
we understand is an issue for people to

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,620
make proposals especially since you have

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,450
to make travel plans arrangements tell

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,410
your management that you're going to go

00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,180
to this conference and give a

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,110
presentation and whatnot so we would

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,840
definitely help you with that in the

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,940
future submission deadline was early I'm

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,310
sorry this is I thought I was doing the

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,100
right thing I tried to model the

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,790
deadline on last year's LPC timeframe

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,500
and I just it's too early I should I

00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,710
should have been in a month or two

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,150
afterwards so I'm sorry about that we

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:22,310
definitely agree that this mission was

00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,210
too early and we'll adjust next time

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:29,420
around so it's more favorable so it's

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,370
having content which is more up-to-date

00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,910
at the time that the conference occurs

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,100
so look at that sorted out that's the

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,860
end of what I have to say for getting

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:43,160
the sessions going at 9:20 we'll have

00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,660
yes burn company talk about xx DP so

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,580
we're looking very much forward to that

00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,740
I wish everyone a great and fantastic

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,350

be attended to or some feedback you'd

00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,570
like to give or
