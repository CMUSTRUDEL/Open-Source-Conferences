speaker:  P. J. Waskiewicz (Intel), Neerav Parikh (Intel)


This talk is a continuation of the initial XDP HW-based hints work presented at NetDev 2.1 in Seoul, South Korea.

It will start with focus on showcasing new prototypes to allow an XDP program to request required HW-generated metadata hints from a NIC. The talk will show how the hints are generated by the NIC and what are the performance characteristics for various XDP applications. We also want to demonstrate how such a metadata can be helpful for applications that use AF_XDP sockets.

The talk with then discuss planned upstreaming thoughts, and look to generate more discussion around implementation details, programming flows, etc., with the larger audience from the community.
