	Future ipv4 unicast extensions

Speaker
Dr Dave TÃ¤ht (Bufferbloat.net)

Description
IPv4's success story was in carrying unicast packets
worldwide.
Service sites still need IPv4 addresses for everything,
since the majority of Internet client nodes don't yet
have IPv6 addresses. IPv4 addresses now cost 15 to 20
dollars apiece (times the size of your network!) and
the price is rising.

The IPv4 address space includes hundreds of millions of
addresses reserved for obscure (the ranges 0/8, and
127/16), or obsolete (225/8-231/8) reasons, or for
"future use" (240/4 - otherwise known as class E).
Instead of leaving these IP addresses unused, we have
started an effort to make them usable, generally. This
work stalled out 10 years ago, because IPv6 was going
to be universally deployed by now, and reliance on IPv4
was expected to be much lower than it in fact still is.

We have been reporting bugs and sending patches to
various vendors. For Linux, we have patches accepted
in the kernel and patches pending for the
distributions, routing daemons, and userland tools.
Slowly but surely, we are decontaminating these IP
addresses so they can be used in the near future.

Many routers already handle many of these addresses,
or can easily be configured to do so, and so we are
working to expand unicast treatment of these addresses
in routers and other OSes. We plan an authorized
experiment to route some of these addresses globally,
monitor their reachability from different parts of the
Internet, and talk to ISPs who are not yet treating
them as unicast to update their networks.

Wouldn't it be a better world with a few hundred
million more IPv4 addresses in it?

(David Taht groans)

00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,953
- Thank you very much.

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,753
Thank you, Dave.

00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:08,350
I'd like to thank John Corbet and the Linux Foundation

00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,200
for getting me here.

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,173
Wasn't planning on coming, actually.

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,430
You probably know me from the Bufferbloat work.

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,926
Has anyone ever heard of that?

00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:20,214
- Me! (whooping)

00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:22,980
(audience clapping)

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,785
- Has everybody here fixed it?

00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:25,980
(audience laughs)

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,300
At home, for your neighbor, for your mom?

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,653
We got about a billion boxes to upgrade.

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,593
Anyway, so.

00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:38,400
Well, we just went through this enormous nick,

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,733
200 gig, whatever.

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,880
This is my copy of the internet,

00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,610
a little home router first developed

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,274
almost 12, 14 years ago, little MIPS processor.

00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:49,510
- [Audience Member] Does that turn on?

00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,343
- I'm sorry, what?

00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,478
- [Audience Member] Is that going to turn on?

00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:53,800
- Oh. (laughing)

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,968
Okay, now it does.

00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:58,580
(audience laughing)

00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,463
Great, happy?

00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,343
We gotta do bandwidth tests somehow.

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,600
Anyway, this is like one of the last opensource home routers

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,660
in the world, almost everything else is Binary BLOBs.

00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,390
You can't modify so many things

00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,180
that come off the shelf today.

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,384
And people keep saying you can't fix the middleboxes.

00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:21,760
It's the middleboxes that are increasingly the problem

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,470
in extending IPv6 or IPv4.

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,210
And this was our last shot at doing so.

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,210
And despite having enormous success with one thing,

00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,850
fixing Bufferbloat, we started the CeroWrt project

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,970
with several other goals.

00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,800
We wanted to improve router security, which we did,

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,580
and we wanted to get IPv6 effectively out into the home.

00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,780
And while we made the world's first IPv6 launch day

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,540
and made open OpenWrt much better,

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,600
all the other middleboxes in the world

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,000
have been kinda laggin' behind that.

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,757
And I hit a point last year where--

00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,040
Well, backstory, I've got plenty of time, don't I?

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Backstory is Netflix turned off my IPv6

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,640
because it was a tunnel.

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,470
And I could no longer get movies anymore.

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,680
And I had to turn off IPv6 for my entire campus.

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,513
Yes, sir?

00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:21,636
- [Audience Member] You just have to black fold Netflix.

00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:22,469
That's what I do.

00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:25,920
- I get it, but I shouldn't have to do that, okay?

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,700
So I got a little frustrated and my friend John Gilmore

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,600
rung me up right around the same time

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,410
and he said that no matter how hard you keep trying

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,120
to make IPv6 work, we're gonna be stuck with IPv4

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,810
for roughly forever.

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,760
How many people here think we're gonna be,

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,453
IPv4 will vanish from the internet in 10 years?

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,795
- [Audience Member] No way.

00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:48,340
(laughing)

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,410
- There's two optimists in the room.

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,910
Please check the Kool-Aid that they've been drinking.

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,200
How 'bout 20?

00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,399
- They find, it you can tell me.

00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,090
(laughing)

00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,150
- That's a good point. - Once we get into

00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,330
the third cell here.

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,230
- That's a good point, the internet is segmenting

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,837
into two different portions, IPv6 and IPv4.

00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:07,904
And that's not necessarily what I wanted to have happen.

00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,911
- [Audience Member] Which one is bigger in 10 years?

00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:12,170
IPv6 side or IPv--

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,278
- It's not size that matters.

00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,600
(laughing)

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,313
It's the motion of the ocean.

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,833
Anyway.

00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,550
There was a report that John threw at me

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,770
from the Internet Governance Group

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,360
and it said, legacy IPv4 will coexist

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,060
with IPv6 indefinitely.

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,810
And aside from these two characters,

00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,510
does anyone believe that's untrue?

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,330
We're stuck with it.

00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,730
Even if you've deployed IPv6

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,950
you're still gonna need IPv4 to connect

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,680
to the rest of the internet.

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,606
Anybody disagree with that?

00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,731
- [Audience Member] Nope.

00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:48,980
(sighs)

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,850
- Now IPv4's been kinda this bastard stepchild

00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,333
to the IETF since 1997.

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,010
We haven't been able to improve it

00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,023
because any time you wanna go improve it

00:03:58,023 --> 00:03:59,940
they say, oh, put it on IPv6.

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,053
And it goes on IPv6 first and then it comes back to IPv4.

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,907
So the thought was to take a fresh look at IPv4

00:04:07,907 --> 00:04:09,660
and the problems that we have with it today,

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,810
particularly along the edge,

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,420
and all the conductivity we have,

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,530
and try to figure out how can we make IPv4 better

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,690
and also try to get to where we have an IPv6 transition

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,580
that happens faster.

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,197
So everybody knows unicast

00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:28,560
is the success story of the internet?

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,260
A large percentage of the traffic

00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,960
is globally routed unicast.

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,570
A lot is translated from behind that.

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,740
We've run out of unicast address space.

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,000
I mean, Tokei over there just got himself a /22.

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,833
Wow.

00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,730
I have a /24, I can't use it

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,883
because my ISP won't route it for me.

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,050
And all the other kinds of IPv4 address spaces

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,520
are tiny niches.

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,670
And the current IPv4 address allocation

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,123
does not reflect that.

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,950
Right now an IPv4 address costs about 20 bucks each.

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,590
That's a lot and they're gonna keep goin' up

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,880
and up and up and up until hopefully at some point

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,130
we have enough demand for IPv6

00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,460
and enough supply for it to finally start to fade.

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,100
At the moment I don't see prices going down

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,370
for the next two or three decades.

00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,240
- [Host] And some entire countries are behind

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,770
a single IPv4 address.

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,160
- This is very true, I used to live in Nicaragua.

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,683
I was behind 13 layers of RFC 1918 to get outta the country.

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,082
Six million people all behind

00:05:37,082 --> 00:05:39,450
(clicks tongue) that level of NAT.

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,630
No way you can get a--

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,030
Anyway, long story, off topic.

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,690
Anyway but we still care, innovators need addresses.

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,660
Big incumbents are buying them wholesale

00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,950
so they won't ever run out,

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,200
but little companies, they won't be able

00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,820
to get their IP addresses anymore

00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,930
unless they go into the cloud.

00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,020
And it's a barrier to competition.

00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,210
It's all fine if we want internet innovation to stop

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,253
or be run by monopolists.

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,380
Land speculators say, buy land,

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,830
they ain't makin' more of it.

00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:13,300
But we can make more IPv4 addresses.

00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,060
It's not hard.

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,950
It was just a few patches, a spec change,

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,300
and a five to seven years to be able to deploy.

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,590
The core people that are involved in the project

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,590
were just tech geeks.

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,880
We do some protocols, we do policy,

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,720
we noticed that IPv4 was gettin' expensive

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,950
and we started investigating

00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,550
what it would take to make more.

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,550
And this is a moonshot talk because it turns out

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,980
the technologies who actually make more IPv4 addresses

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,860
is quite trivial.

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,090
But the politics and the long tail deployment

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,023
are very long and very difficult.

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,690
It's not a Linux issues, it's not a BSD issue,

00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,113
it's not a Windows issue, it's a protocol issue.

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:02,004
So john Gilmore, everybody know who John is?

00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,837
- [Audience Member] Yes.

00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,000
- Founded the EFF?

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,030
I think he did some work with you on the Spark stuff,

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,590
didn't he, David?

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,423
Back in the day. - Yes.

00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,300
John used to run around naked at the Sun offices

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,133
when he was working--

00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:13,966
(laughs) - Yeah?

00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,584
Yes, Mase.

00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:18,987
- [Mase] It's not a protocol issue, it's a hardware

00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:21,088
and an administrative issue.

00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,230
- Okay, yeah, or firmware if you like.

00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,660
There's plenty of other issues out there.

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,460
You wanna say that again in the mic?

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,910
- It's not a protocol issue,

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,120
it's a hardware and administrative issue.

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,953
- Okay.

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
So is the IPv6 rollout.

00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,333
- Yes.

00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,166
- Yes.

00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,870
So anyway, John was responsible for BOOTP,

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,120
anybody ever use that?

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,310
- [Audience Member] Yes.

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,693
- And DHCP.

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,780
I'm gonna get to the cool bug that we fixed

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,490
related to that, and he did the EFF.

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,700
And me, I, well, everyone's heard of fq_codel,

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,420
which is primarily Eric's innovation over there.

00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,410
But I'm the guy that kicked Apple and IETF

00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,180
into adopting it almost universally worldwide.

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,370
I also run the Make-Wifi-Fast projects and CeroWrt,

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,090
and recently, sch_cake.

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,810
And Paul Wouters who's not here

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,350
does IPSEC, et cetera, for that.

00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,600
So I wanted to quote a little bit from Karl Auerbach.

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,550
Does anyone know who Karl Auerbach was?

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,860
Ancient prehistory.

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,710
Remember the very first internet election worldwide

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,020
for the ICANN board in 1999.

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,120
He was the independent director elected worldwide

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,080
who fought really hard for a free and open internet

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
and mostly lost.

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,147
But he's still there and he once said,

00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:42,190
"The internet is not finished."

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,960
It's just an experiment.

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,770
It's a success disaster.

00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,920
It arose from the contributions of many, many people.

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,863
There were no singular geniuses.

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,630
Rather the internet is a collage of many mind.

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,200
There was no grand plan.

00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,870
Does anyone here think there was a grand plan?

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,010
- Nope. - No!

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,640
It could have evolved into something quite different

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,473
than it is today.

00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:04,350
I had hoped it would evolve into something

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,170
that's quite different than it is today.

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,060
I still like to get my email at home, you know?

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,590
Oops.

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,973
So there are no deities.

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,080
It's much more than the World Wide Web.

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,399
Government initiatives can also produce great things.

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,867
"The internet's not finished.

00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,070
"There's much left to be created."

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,470
Wifi is 21 years old.

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,360
Cellphones are, as we know them, and smartphones,

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,793
are about 12, 11 years old.

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,860
We have a long way to go before the internet fades away.

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,590
Karl Auerbach.

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,150
So in talking about what we're going to try to do,

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,230
or what we've been trying to create some controversy

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,710
while doing, is that going back in time

00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,623
when we had IPv4s laid out in the late 1980s?

00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:55,640
1980, 1979, 1979.

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,880
We had Class A, Class B, and Class C addresses.

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,083
Who remembers those?

00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,103
Yay!

00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,850
Good, I'm not so gray.

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,060
Now we call them /8, /16, and /24s.

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,900
0/8 was find my network number in 1984.

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,373
But that didn't work on LANs, LANs were new then.

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,690
So they retired that in 1989, RFC 1122,

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,852
and it was replaced by BOOTP and DHCP.

00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:27,450
127/8, 16 million addresses for a loopback.

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,220
Class A address.

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,423
Multicast, who here uses multicast?

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,510
Everyone uses a little multicast, but not a lot.

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,470
We laid out 260 million addresses for multicast

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,860
thinking we're going to actually use it

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,023
for broadcast television, which never happened.

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,550
So in 1992 we replaced Class A, B and C concepts

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,000
with something called CIDR.

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,260
It took years and years to deploy,

00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,733
about eight years really before it became stable.

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,070
- [Host] And routing was never the same since.

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,470
- Very true.

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,780
And we had to change, at the time,

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,110
every single internet node on every single operating system.

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,460
It took awhile.

00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,000
But we got the core done in that amount of time,

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,420
worked pretty good.

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,790
224 everyone was in love with for multicast

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,943
but it never scaled like unicast.

00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:20,920
They said so many insoluble problems.

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,753
Yes, Mase?

00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:22,870
- I think it's worth pointing out

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,890
that for the switchover from class full to classless

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,450
you only actually have to fix the edge of the network.

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,190
You don't have to fix the core of the network

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,183
to make use of it.

00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,210
- That's a reasonable point,

00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,390
but you still need it to be able to get--

00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,590
I'll let that point stick.

00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,900
Did someone else have their hand up just now?

00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,760
No?

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,110
Okay.

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,500
So we went lookin'--

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,400
Oh, go 'head, sir.

00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,103
- [Audience Member] Pass the mic.

00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:46,936
- David Woodhouse?

00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:47,769
- [Audience Member] Where?

00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:50,983
- Woodhouse, Mr. Woodhouse had his hand up.

00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,180
(audience laughing)

00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,580
- I was just gonna say to the last comment,

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,080
except when that wasn't true

00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,210
because intermediate routers would drop things

00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,790
that end with .255, et cetera.

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,303
So there were issues in the core sometimes.

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,101
- Zero and 255 were problematic

00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,230
going a long way back, period, and--

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,370
- [David Woodhouse] Anything ending with the .255.

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,203
- Yeah.

00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:12,223
So oop, uh-oh.

00:12:13,064 --> 00:12:15,360
- There he goes, there it is. - Back and forth we go!

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,080
- I've actually seen zero be problematic even recently

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,715
because it was zero terminated strings.

00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:23,730
(laughing)

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,713
- Oy vey!

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,800
All right, I'm doing okay for time?

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,450
Okay, so I only have a couple more slides

00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,670
and then I can talk about--

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,440
Earlier before the talk I distributed some questions

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,890
to the audience and I'm gonna read off some of the answers.

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,930
So how do we make new IPv4 addresses?

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,040
We make a small spec change, we make a couple small patches

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,590
to kernels and userspaces, we do a set of testbeds,

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,780
and iterate the above 'til it all works,

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,640
and only then tackle the politics as to how to allocate 'em.

00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,460
Running code first.

00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,360
Rough consensus screwed it up 10 years ago,

00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,683
you were there for that.

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,430
Anyway.

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,630
So the bunch of things that were reserved for future use.

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,330
240/4, 10 plus years ago, was all the rage.

00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,490
Yes, we'll find some way

00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,640
of using up 260 million new IP addresses.

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,813
We needed 'em bad and instead of actually finishing the RFCs

00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:24,140
for it, all the operating systems except Windows

00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,460
adopted support for it,

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,190
and yet we were never able to allocate them.

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,350
Last added a nit fix for that in December

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,783
and the patches are available for BSD.

00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,133
And we had 0/8.

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,730
Global Unicast.

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,010
Never used except for 0.0.0.

00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,350
That was the bug that John Gilmore had fixed with DHCP

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,920
in 1986, I think it was.

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,920
This is a 33-year-old bug in the specification for IPv4.

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,740
So just recently Dave accepted the patch for 0.0.0,

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,590
and we're trying to get it elsewhere.

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,150
Now to really stir up the mix, we talked about local host.

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,910
How many addresses did people use

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,860
out of the 127 range today?

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,290
Is it more than one?

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,500
- [Audience Member] Yes.

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,371
- How many, it's two?

00:14:14,371 --> 00:14:15,204
Five?

00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:16,170
I see five?

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,270
10?

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,270
Okay, so 10 out of 16 million is what?

00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,613
(laughs)

00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,739
- [Audience Member] It's more than 10.

00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:28,280
- It's more than 10 but I believe it's less than 16 million.

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,580
Yes. (laughing)

00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,150
So recently I put out what I'd hoped

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,820
would be a somewhat controversial patch fixing that,

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,050
which reduced it to a /16.

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,270
64,000 addresses reserved for local host.

00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,420
Now ideally, I don't know how to use 'em,

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,150
all I know is that, hey!

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,440
We got 15.9 million and--

00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,760
We'll figure out what to do with 'em later.

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,140
The same thing goes for 224/4.

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,810
We ended up allocating stuff

00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,070
at the bottom part of the range,

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,070
224/8, and at the top part of the range, 239/8.

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,190
There's some weirdnesses in the multicast ranges

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,530
for 232 and up.

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,480
But 225 through 231 were reserved

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,593
for future use back in 1989 and never used!

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,450
And we scanned all the source code in the world

00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,021
and we couldn't find anybody using them!

00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:20,854
- [Mase] That's not true.

00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,670
- Okay, all of opensource code that we could find.

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,075
- [Mase] It's well-known--

00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,940
- Go ahead, go ahead, Mase.

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,820
- So there's a well-known and published hack,

00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,910
standard, whatever you wanna call it,

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,520
where IPv6 gets coalesced into 224/3.

00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,360
- [David Taht] Yeah, where's that referenced?

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,600
- I don't know but it's been,

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,980
I mean Lorenzo has talked about it

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,540
even a half a decade ago if not longer ago

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,883
at various talks.

00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,980
I know we use that extensively internally

00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,620
and I'm pretty sure other people have--

00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,558
I don't know, does someone from

00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:58,391
CloudCorp-- - Is anybody else using 220?

00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,160
- Did they do something similar?

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,880
- [David Taht] 225 and up?

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,553
- [Audience Member] Going once.

00:16:03,553 --> 00:16:04,525
Going twice. - Going twice.

00:16:04,525 --> 00:16:06,090
(laughing)

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,350
- [Audience Member] Google only.

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,230
- Google only. (laughs)

00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,660
120-plus million IP addresses

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,360
possibly used for that by Google.

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,063
- Actually half a billion.

00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:17,740
(laughs) - The whole share.

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,300
But it'd be cool to--

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,133
Go ahead.

00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,100
- About the loopback ones.

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,910
I'm aware of a couple of products that use the 127 range.

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,790
So it's all internal.

00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,740
I mean, you're not gonna find that

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,370
by doing a search of opensource code, of course.

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,779
- Part of it is shakin' the tree to see what falls out.

00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,612
(audience member laughs)

00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:35,445
Okay?

00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,257
And we did reserve the bottom part of it and somebody--

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,070
Shake the tree, see what happens.

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,850
- Sure, and Linux for a long time has said

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,480
anything under 127/8 is local

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,380
and it will accept connections for it.

00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,960
- Yeah.

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,070
So anyway, this was the patch for zero.

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,073
People were goin' around sayin', oh,

00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:54,380
this is gonna be so hard to roll out.

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,060
That was the total patch.

00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,133
I actually saved a nanosecond while doin' that one.

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,050
Arguably, you should rename the function,

00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,660
but I had to touch 22 files to do that

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,217
and I didn't know Dave would take it.

00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:08,110
(laughing)

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:08,970
So I left that.

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,420
- People sent me angry cat pictures on Twitter

00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,044
after I applied that patch.

00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:13,930
(laughs) - It got good play

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,260
on Reddit too and other places

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,187
and you know, that's life.

00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,393
- [David] How dare you

00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:22,103
(laughs) kinda situation.

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,356
- Well anyway, we do wanna work on making

00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:27,690
the zeroth address work better.

00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,930
There's only a couple user space tools to check for,

00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,990
there's a couple other bugs throughout the system.

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,870
We wanna be able to get, I forget which RFC, RFC 3021.

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,280
We want ISPs to be able to use up more addresses

00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,920
than they have for IPv4 since we're squeezin' 'em.

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,760
And there's innumerable other things we could do

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,200
to make IPv4 a little bit better.

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,350
Including a few that I am totally scared to put on tape.

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,643
You can see me at lunch.

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,380
So my little group has been landing patches

00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,970
and testing, doing interop.

00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,982
Our plan is to put up a periscope,

00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,880
telescope, whatever you call it,

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,020
to look at backscatter for it

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,890
to start trying to interoperate with zero

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,460
possibly as the starter rather than 240.

00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,660
And go and build up to what we can possibly,

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,410
to get to where we can do globally routable these addresses.

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,143
Many people have come to me.

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,730
Dozens of people have come to me now saying, well,

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,940
it's totally okay, we can add this to RFC 1918 space.

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,410
And I'm like, but can't we try to make it globally routable?

00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,620
Don't you want an IPv4 address for everybody?

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,660
And they go, ah, I gotta be--

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,410
No, can we try?

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,930
And first up they have to be routable for that to happen.

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,320
Anyway, it turned out in our researches

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,280
that multiple SDNs and pieces of software

00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,810
that did stuff in user space

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,319
actually weren't doing any checking at all.

00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,152
AWS?

00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,513
Pure unicast space.

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,640
And that was pretty much the defining thing.

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,110
I said, well, we should go ahead and try to do this.

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,260
So it's implemented now,

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,363
I think zero and 240 are out on OpenWrt.

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,530
And we hope that from there over the course

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,003
of multiple years we'll try to make a better IPv4 internet.

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
Last thing up, I have a whole bunch of people

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
that had given me suggestions

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,930
but I thought I'd take a couple quick questions first.

00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,230
- [Host] Yeah, did anyone have a questions

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,090
on the address extensions

00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,173
and allocating more IPv4 addresses to the public?

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,130
- So for 127 I know people have used various high values

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,410
of 127 never using a lot of addresses,

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,800
but just using random numbers out of 127.

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,700
- [Host] So they stayed away from loopbacks address

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,840
as far as possible.

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,673
(host laughs)

00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:53,940
- So for example I know that we coalesce ::1

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,870
into 127.6.6.6.

00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,790
- [Host] I see.

00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,940
- Okay, good to know. - So that's a conflict

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,183
with reducing the size of 127.

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,660
I know that for 224 and up there's the coalesce

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,360
all IPv6 space in order to get something that's parsable

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,403
by IPv4 tools, so basically hash IPv6 space into that.

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,750
And I know also that people have been using the 240 space

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,543
as RFC 1918 space for awhile now.

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,543
- Why didn't they just use

00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:25,030
the US government's, military or whatever?

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,675
- I did make that suggestion.

00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:30,510
(laughing) I even mentioned that 11/8

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,498
is CIA and it's right next to 10/8 and it's unused, but--

00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,748
(laughing)

00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:43,820
- Okay.

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,827
- All right, my meta point though is that--

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,960
So going back to this thing.

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,020
I've worked on IPv6 my whole life

00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,060
and I really wanna see IPv6 succeed.

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,010
And there's a lot of work that needs to get done

00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,070
to make IPv6 better.

00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,080
And I wanted to list off

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,300
some of the things people suggested.

00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,583
Has anyone here ever heard of RFC 7368?

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,967
That's your homework assignment, go look that one up.

00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:14,160
RFC 7368.

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,350
Ideally that's how we get more IPv6

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,060
into small home networks, small office spaces,

00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,263
and outta the data center along the edge.

00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,903
Who here uses Android?

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,980
How many of you tether via Android?

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,710
How many of you would like to have IPv6

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,720
via your tether via Android?

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,550
So there's an RFC 6653, hasn't been implemented yet.

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,003
Somebody should go do that.

00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:41,912
Has anyone here ever heard of source-specific routing?

00:21:41,912 --> 00:21:42,818
- [Audience Member] Woo!

00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,320
- Woohoo.

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,080
That's a method of having multiple homing--

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,660
So you can have more than one provider,

00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,010
or in the case of a cellphone you're can have

00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,130
your Multipath TCP actually work

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:55,370
between two different connections.

00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,340
Not implemented very many places

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,400
and it needs to be implemented for IPv6 RA.

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,120
And I have a couple more suggestions here.

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
The next suggestion,

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,800
what would you do to make IPv6 more deployable?

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Break IPv4, or at least add features to IPv6 but not four.

00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:13,770
Okay.

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,910
There's a question,

00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,290
why would I deploy a 20-year-old technology?

00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:19,790
Well, I have to answer that one, because it works?

00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,856
(laughs)

00:22:21,856 --> 00:22:23,590
- [Host] Electricity is a little bit older,

00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,010
we still deploy that, don't we?

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,843
- Yeah!

00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:26,740
(laughing)

00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,170
And let's skip a couple other ones.

00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,093
Get all the ISPs to implement it.

00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,200
- [Host] Yeah I think that's the big one for me.

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,180
- To me, we found our own bureaucracy and inertia,

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:41,550
lousy profit margins, low demand from customers.

00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,780
To me, we have to get out there and march and complain,

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,543
I want my IPv6.

00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:49,943
I want my email to come back to my home.

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,860
We need to improve our political thing here.

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,800
I can't read that one here, that one here.

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,233
And upgrade everything!

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,990
I got to admit that in doin' this one

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,350
I really hoped that we would see the upgrade cycle

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,190
get better, not just for IPv6 support but to fix this,

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,040
what was the B word?

00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,030
Not blockchain, no, it was--

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,680
Oh yeah, Bufferbloat, yeah.

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,723
And I was sad to see this network here is buffer bloated.

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,925
- [Host] Just that whole thing would have been nice to fix

00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:30,860
from the perspective of the kind of problems

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,430
we see with IOT which is lack of support,

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:36,350
lack of updegradability means vulnerability.

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,410
- Yes.

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,170
So OTA, OTA should be bloody mandatory.

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,940
- Absolutely, like legally.

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,220
There should be some legal protection for consumers

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,650
that you can't just disappear

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,810
and not have your stuff upgraded.

00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,130
- So several years ago, in order to be able to deliver this,

00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,150
you probably were around,

00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,372
I had to go to war, we went to war, Tokei and I,

00:23:57,372 --> 00:24:01,160
with the FCC just so we could reflash our own routers.

00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,330
The fight for the right to reflash our own routers

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,740
and I don't wanna have to fight like that,

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,830
it should be obvious at this point

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,810
that the edge of the network is insecure,

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,280
it needs to be continuously upgraded.

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,950
- [Host] The thing is if you try to say to someone, hey,

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,930
you buy this car, you can only change the tires

00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,670
at the vendor's garage, they're like, no, that's ridiculous,

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,810
I should be able to put tires anywhere.

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,910
But if you use the technology example, they're like,

00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,610
oh, I don't understand why that's so important.

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,060
- [Audience Member] Hey, your John Deere tractors

00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,050
are that way now.

00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,921
(host laughs)

00:24:28,921 --> 00:24:29,754
- [Host] Right.

00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:32,710
- That is the classic example, the John Deere example,

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,130
but somehow I'm peripherally involved

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,090
with the European wireless--

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,740
What was it called?

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,540
The wireless directive?

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,588
Radio directive.

00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:42,421
- [Audience Member] Radio directive.

00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:43,850
- Or the FSFE.

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,490
They're trying to lock down the routers

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,983
in case of Broadcom, can I go pick on Broadcom

00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:51,160
(laughing) and their wireless stuff?

00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,327
I would like us to make--

00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,240
(laughing)

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,450
- [Audience Member] He's looking around.

00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,730
- I would like us to make a really strong point

00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,200
that Binary BLOBs are insecure and they're dangerous

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,200
and they're buggy and somehow we have to work much harder

00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,490
within the Linux Foundation and elsewhere

00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,240
to make sure the regulatory agencies understand that.

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,180
One of the things that really bugged me

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,460
about the whole Volkswagen crisis, not once--

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,870
The diesel scandal, $28 billion in fines,

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,700
not once was the remedy

00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:27,130
being opensource your bloody drivers.

00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,270
Because they would never have been tempted

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,620
to lie about their emissions.

00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,130
- [Host] And the other elements of this is

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,370
I may not want to become an auto mechanic

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,040
but I would like to choose the auto mechanic

00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,350
who can fix my car.

00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,760
- Groovy.

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,527
So I hope that in the coming years we do a better job of--

00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:44,360
And the only way I feel we can upgrade

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,870
all the middleboxes is to do a better job

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,650
of working on making 'em opensource,

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,423
and to keep pluggin' away.

00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,223
So, any more questions?

00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,353
- [Audience Member] Are we good?

00:25:58,353 --> 00:25:59,186
- Thank you all for

00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:00,738
letting me rant a little bit. - Thank you very much, David.

00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:04,405
