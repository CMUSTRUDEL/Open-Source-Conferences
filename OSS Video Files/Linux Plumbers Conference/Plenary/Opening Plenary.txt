committee I'd like to wish your welcome

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,679

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,900
Orleans we have a very good program

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,270
lined up unfortunately I'm also a little

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:26,550
short of times I'll try and do this

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:30,119
quickly I will mention what I'd like to

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,809
thank the planning committee Jessie

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:39,030

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,760
particularly i'd like to mention that we

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,890
have two people two of our committee who

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,969
couldn't make it today so i kind of want

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,430
to send a special thank-you to them

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,800
Jessie Barnes who had the strange idea

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,109
to time becoming a father again just

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,460
before the conference obviously he's got

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,019
something wrong with his timing there

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,380
because he needs to get his priorities

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,950
right and Elena who couldn't make it

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,260
because she lost her father recently and

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,619
so if you see her you know please say

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,850
thank you and give her a hug for

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:23,520

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,450
tremendous amount of work for us without

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,100
their efforts and all the practical work

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,530
they're doing we would have no

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,850
conference so thanks a lot to the Linux

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,659
paper review committee who were drafted

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,899
on short notice to help us out reviewing

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:55,170

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:03,450
going through a large amount of papers I

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,750
can't remember we had about a hundred or

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,330
something to look through so please

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,450
thank them all

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,630
on top of that we have a pretty packed

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,890
programme on the micro conference area

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:22,270
we have 13 different micro conferences

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,920
ranging from everywhere from little

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,230
android and automotive to large

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,580
scalability issues I'm not going to let

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,680
go through all the names here because

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,010
it's just too many and will be wasting

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,360
all our day the micro conference leaders

00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,130
are the ones who really put the

00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,020
conference together or the bulk of the

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,959
conference so you should be grateful and

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:51,430
thank them for their efforts please give

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:53,050
them a hand on top of that we need to

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,950
remember that we never have a conference

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,750
like this without our sponsors so in I'd

00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:04,000
like to start by thanking our platinum

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:09,209
sponsor Intel they have obviously put a

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,320
lot of effort into helping us here and

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,320
give it please give them a hand as well

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,549
in addition I would like to mention that

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,280
we have two gold sponsors IBM and

00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:27,040
Samsung who we are very happy for having

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,220
AG well so please give them a ham as

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,220
well

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,160
now to the more real part of the

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,080
conference part we have a pretty good

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,320
program lined up well I should say a

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,750
very good program line not we have three

00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,870
days of conference which includes refer

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,140
refereed talks which we share with linux

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:53,300
con they are all on the wednesday then

00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,460
we have three days of micro conferences

00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,080
there are scattered out over the three

00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:01,000
days so you need to check the website

00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:05,890
for the details on the micro conferences

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,230
we have box and and then we have

00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,290
reserved space and rooms for hack time

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,310
as well so when you've acted this

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,480
concluded you have a real problem you

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,830
don't want to go and fix it you've also

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,610
reserve some space that you can go and

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,890
sit down and fix the problems and of

00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,630
course we have social events on top of

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,660
it which should never be forgotten when

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:31,460
you're at plumbers both proposals we

00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,970
still have time or space for more both

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,220
proposals and slots for them so if you

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,070
have a buff you can submit them using

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,540
the website I put a short URL in there

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,890
because I couldn't have the long one and

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,990
nobody could see it anyway but otherwise

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,460
you can find it submit it through the

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,910
submitted proposal on the plumbers

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,370
website if you do that please send us an

00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:56,090
email as well because that makes sure we

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,890
actually see that there's new entries we

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,220
can reserve space out in and before you

00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,460
for hack time and on Friday we will have

00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,920
two dedicated rooms for this purpose

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,830
where people can go and sit down there

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:18,830
should be power and Wi-Fi and tables and

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:21,740
chairs I guess the search bar VD how do

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,890
you put it the key for plumbers is the

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,800
micro conference concept and the micro

00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,660
conferences is where I think a lot of it

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,920
really comes together what makes plumber

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,840
so special looking at the micro

00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,370
conference it's important to think look

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,800
at and say they should be attacking a

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,800
significant problem or set of problems

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,790
includes the kernel and use of space and

00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,180
trying to make them work together get

00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,850
them together we really want to see

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,050
plumbers being a discussion forum we're

00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,700
not particularly interested in hearing

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:58,090
about finished work we want people get

00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:01,290
together and solve problems so mostly

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,170
discussion minimize the number of lives

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:07,120
we want plumbers to be open to everybody

00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,880
it shouldn't be a little creek just

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,470
discussing themselves it should be

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:17,800
taking everything new people new ideas

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,410
in addition we want to see all plan all

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,940
micro conferences produce a readout on

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,320
Friday during the closing plenary to

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,460
tell us about what has been discussed

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,360
and what's been achieved and what

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,360
they're going to do next we would like

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,890
them or we we ask that they are all

00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,930
taking notes in the provided ether pads

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,580
so we can collect these nodes and share

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,500
them and keep them for after the

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,560
conference for those who are not able to

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:53,440
attend and we ask that you once you're

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:57,490
done email you email us your slides the

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,170
layout of the rooms each michael

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,850
conference room will actually be in here

00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,770
so once we've done here they will close

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,590
off part of this and turn it into three

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,330
rooms there'll be a normal projector for

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,430
slides there will be a projector in the

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,040
corner like the ones you see there for

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,500
an ether pad where some somebody can

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,330
take notes so we encourage the micro

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,040
conference leader to make sure that he

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,720
or she always has somebody assigned to

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,910
take notes I mean they allowed to take

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:28,600
turns it'll be in the rooms call selsdon

00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,040
SG & H and we will be recorded video

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,920
recording these sessions and putting

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,270
them up on the internet afterwards so we

00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,290
can share the conference with those who

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:40,510
couldn't attend the referee tracks are

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:43,990
shared with Linux con and you should

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:47,560
check the monitors for which rooms then

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,630
and when and in addition we have the

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,000
hack space which we didn't have much of

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,400
last year we're trying to make more push

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,840
that more this year it will be risk

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,210
there will be seeding in the four year

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,750
and on Friday we'll have two rooms

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,940
upstairs on on the fourth floor Imperial

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,250
10 and 11 you can either just take the

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,930
elevator up one floor or take the stairs

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,820
I mean take the stairs is probably a

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:15,160
good healthier option I'm sure James

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:20,410
agrees in addition please pay your

00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:22,930
badges at all time inside the hotel we

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:25,720
you we will be checking to make sure

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:30,940
that we are not having non plumbers

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:32,200
people attend and you also need it for

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,490
all the social events you will not be

00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,900
let into the social event without your

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:42,159
badge so please keep it on you hungry

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,200
engineers are not going to do much work

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,790
so we have breakfast out here in the

00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,860
four-year in the morning there'll be

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,650
coffee break served in the four year as

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,070
well and on top of that you should all

00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:56,589
have received three of these these

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:59,589
purple coupons which will allow you it's

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:02,890
a voucher for $22 that you can use in

00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,750
for the restaurants of the hotel and and

00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,580
today there were also be additional

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,170
concession stands in the story will hold

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,690
because we're sharing with Linux console

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,160
there will be a lot of people today so

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,290
you have basically one coupon per day

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,420
once you've used it for meal you cannot

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:18,880
claim the rest of the of the value if

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,380
you're only getting a small drink so but

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,910
at least it should allow you to get food

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,420
and you can pick and choose pretty much

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,420
like you want

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,190
no plumbers without social events so

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,080
tonight we have a I don't know if it's a

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,380
reception or it's not a dinner but it's

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,190
a party reception with which we say over

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,080
the Linux Khan at the house of blues we

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,380
have a parade leaving the hotel tonight

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:53,620
at 5 45 p.m. so you should be at the

00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,990
lobby to participate in the parade by

00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,140
five-thirty it's about a one-mile walk

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,150
so it should be doable for pretty much

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,730
everybody those who do not wish to walk

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:10,570
or cannot walk can take a bus that would

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,310
depart the hotel I was told 615 so be at

00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:16,350
the lobby by six to make sure you get on

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:20,470
the bus but join the parade if you can

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,630
yeah and there will be drinks as you

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,880
leave the hotel it should be I have been

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,250
told that people actually allowed to

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,460
walk and drink in public in New Orleans

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:33,600
so there will be drinks handed out as we

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:37,110
leave the hotel for the for the parade

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,740
there will also be water bottles I think

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,960
of course on Friday we have the plumbers

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,580
signature event the plumbers closing

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,630
party there would be no plumbers without

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,350
the phone is causing party obviously

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:53,740
it'll be at the Grand Isle restaurant we

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,690
will have buses and and transportation

00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,750
for that there will be more information

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,910
about this event on the Friday plenary I

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,230
went to check out the restaurant with

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,620
some of the committee members yesterday

00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,900
we did some research and it is highly

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,940
recommended the hope it'll be at least

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,210
as good as lat walk on par with last

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:17,410
year again where your badge for those

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:23,380
events okay I'm doing much faster than

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:26,170
I'd hoped for so that's good yeah I was

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:31,270
told to recommend a few safety issues

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,800
for New Orleans by a local expert it is

00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:35,320
supposed to be one of the highest crime

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,330
cities in the US so be a little careful

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,940
about how you're walking around what are

00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,279
you behaving in public apply

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,279
common-sense

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,649
and try not stand out as a visiting nerd

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,899
by carrying badges and laptops and

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:54,640
things highly visible I haven't

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,589
experienced any of these problems but we

00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,620
just encourage you to enjoy the

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:02,290
conference have fun but also be sensible

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,810
