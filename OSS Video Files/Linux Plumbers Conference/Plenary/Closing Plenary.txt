okay everybody let's get started this is

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,920
the last and final session of plumbers

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,090
conference and in the session you'll

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,519
actually hear the readouts from

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,560
everybody about what they're going to do

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,930
first of all before we get into this I

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,430
hope you all enjoyed yourself and so I'd

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,869
like you to give a big hand to the

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,180
planning committee who are listed up

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,740
there you'll all come up here to say

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,000
thank you to everybody who's going to

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,550
congratulate you for putting on a

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,990
reasonably good conference and you can

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,990
clap louder it is very good

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,380
so I have to say in spite of the stress

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,000
involved we enjoyed putting it on we

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,450
also see to say a special thank you to

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,980
the lacs foundation who provided all the

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,350
logistics and booked all of the events

00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,960
apart from this real last one which was

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,930
done by Becky Bruce so that's Angela

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,550
Marissa Stephanie and Craig so could you

00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,239
also say thank you to them too I'm not

00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,239
sure they actually

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,340
and then of course the paper review

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,619
committee that was the previous

00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,590
committee plus Paul mechanical McMartin

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:22,229
and David Woodhouse to say thank you to

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,149
them as well and finally I have to

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,369
remind you that in the event tonight we

00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:28,439
have a completely open bar and we have a

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,390
massive food menu and I wouldn't

00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,969
actually be possible unless all of these

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:36,170
people gave us money so these are the

00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:36,170
entire list of sponsors

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,550
alright I don't have to remind you to

00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,870
thank them you're just planking them for

00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:48,970
the booze so as with everything in

00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:51,040
plumbers we always do a very special

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,590
event at the end which is completely

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,600
plumber specific I know some some people

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,340
don't like the size of the combined

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,410
events with linux con so we make sure

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,320
that we do one last event that's

00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:04,420
plumbers only with no loud music so you

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,830
can actually go off to tables do your

00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:13,930
last-minute discussions and hear each

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:16,270
other talk so because this event is not

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:18,820
necessarily done by the Linux Foundation

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,310
we have to appoint a very special person

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:23,500
to actually select it do it and sort

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,970
everything out I'm afraid the very

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,470
special person is just enjoying a

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,780
hurricane over there but Becky Bruce

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:32,970
come up she wasn't actually standing out

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,970
for the planning committee so this is

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,990
this is the person who planned and

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,490
organized this event Pacific if you

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,470
don't like it it's her fault don't come

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,080
to me i'm good at kursi and then James

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,780
is going to show you who's curtsey no we

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,640
practiced that last night anyway I just

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,800
some quick logistics about the party

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,959
tonight miss James mention we're going

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,880
to be at a restaurant called Grand Isle

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,560
it's over by the river walk it's about

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,320
seven or eight blocks to the French

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,060
Quarter our party scheduled for seven to

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,300
ten so start gathering down on the bus

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,830
lobby at six thirty where your badge

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,880
it's your drink ticket we're not doing

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:12,580
this you get two drinks thing so it's up

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,250
to you to wear your badge and again

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,590
party closes at ten that some will put

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,170
you guys out and you can go and do your

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,180
own thing also we have tried to do quite

00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,620
a bit of cleaning for a vegetarian this

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,780
isn't really a vegetarian friendly City

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,550
so we've had the chef create some dishes

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,459
for us but if there are any of you that

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,200
have other dietary needs or you feel

00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,730
that there's some problem talk to us

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,610
will get stuff to make you something I

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,820
don't want anybody to be hungry and they

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,820
leave

00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:42,829
okay so you don't actually have to worry

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,540
about that because I actually talked to

00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:46,129
the restaurant they were like okay so

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,629
you just want this veggie stuff on the

00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:50,810
side I'm like no there's bunch of guys

00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,310
they cannot resist tasting everything so

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,269
it should be pretty balanced you don't

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:59,569
have to worry about eating the veggie

00:03:53,269 --> 00:04:01,220
food yeah I think that's it so thank you

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:09,230
James you're very welcome thank you very

00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:11,690
much so before we get to the food and

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,389
this is a reminder to brevity and the

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,419
drinks the micro conference leads which

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:20,900
are these people are going to come up

00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:24,440
and give us a readout we actually asked

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,720
them to send the slides beforehand we

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,280
got them from all but three so if you

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,949
lot don't come up we're going to be

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,570
mocking you in the sessions we did tell

00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:34,910
the micro conference leads that they had

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,580
five minutes when somebody forgot to

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,110
multiply 5 x 14 and come out with that

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,449
would be 70 minutes for doing this

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,260
closing so you now have a minute and a

00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:47,430
half on the web cam down

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,080
we will be doing this like speed dating

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,000
but before you get into it it is very

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,410
important that you appreciate that there

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,780
is actually a lot of work that goes into

00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,000
being a lead for this try and set it up

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,400
gather the speakers together corral them

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,050
keep the discussion going so I think you

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,610
should probably give a big hand to all

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,840
of the micro conference leaders who

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:13,180
listed up there I'm not going to bore

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:14,890
you by reading and before we get on to

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,390
it i thought i'd remind you of what the

00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,130
micro conscience should and shouldn't be

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,840
doing they should be attacking a

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,940
significant problem they should

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,160
primarily be discussion based that meant

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,290
no slides i did walk into a few that

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,230
didn't actually keep up with that you

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,820
know who you are they should be open to

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,830
all comers and they should produce a

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,270
readout for the closing session the

00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,070
three of you who didn't produce readouts

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,750
you know who you are and everybody else

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,130
is about to know who you are and

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,400
obviously they should provide notes on

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,840
the etherpad and it's now too late to

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,560
mail me your slides because I'm already

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:51,670
rejecting them so with that llvm you're

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,150
up first where are you you're going to

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:56,440
be doing from my slides not yours

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:59,189
countdown timer starts now here's the

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,560
microphone begin talking

00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:05,229
alright so we have a few action items

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,629
for lvm community to try to address some

00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,680
of the the feedback that we got

00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:10,240
regarding adding a built-in stack

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,849
pointer handling warnings and the

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,370
semantics they have some ambiguous

00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:17,500
behavior and some issues with C++ 14

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,120
that's not yet supported curl patches

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,740
very thankful for a lynus for

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,919
participating his feedback was really

00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,419
helpful the gadget driver developer was

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,849
there and he actually took one of our

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,169
patches we have a plan to get many of

00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:30,520
the other patches up and I think all of

00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,909
the blocking patches I think we have a

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,099
roadmap for acceptance the static

00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:38,440
analyzer Edward our google Summer of

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:39,819
Code participant do you have a great

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,190
talk there he's going to add some

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,560
documentation on the work that he did

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,879
and how to run it some user space things

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,759
we found out from debian and from

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,759
android same issues that are hitting the

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,110
colonel there's a need to upstream a lot

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,520
of that information so that we can try

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,440
to fix those in the upstream packages

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,509
and then we have a some more future work

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,389
to try to do regarding the integrated

00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:04,690
assembler some more potential google

00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,120
Summer of Code work and trying to get

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:09,789
the integrated assembler working better

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:17,740
with the code ok 20 seconds to spare

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:19,509
well done secure boot next just before

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,180
he starts the next one I have to secure

00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,729
boot will be Android so for secure boot

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,719
we started off with Matthew Garrett

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:27,069
threatening to lock everybody in a room

00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:30,159
but then he also offered to pay

00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,240
everybody if he could just merge code we

00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,979
actually came up with a pretty good

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,029
consensus on what we're going to do for

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,250
the colonel side of things we're going

00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:38,589
to have a lockdown flag he won't be

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,389
called secure level or secure modules

00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:44,379
because Lina's doesn't like that and

00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,610
told us that fairly clearly um so we're

00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,719
going to run set on it and name it

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,039
something different and everything will

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:52,839
be ok after that which actually took a

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,319
lot less time that I thought it would we

00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:57,879
had a reminder from James that the Free

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,259
Software Foundation is okay with secure

00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,969
boot because you can inter setup mode

00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:03,639
and enter your own keys so it does not

00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:06,849
run afoul of the gplv3 then he went on

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,199
to discuss how his linux foundation

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,849
bootloader works and we're going to

00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,370
actually unify that and matthew garrett

00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:14,979
shim bootloader going forward and

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,870
participate in UEFI standards body to

00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,500
get that actually inspect so we're not

00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:22,870
doing dirty hex after that vivek Goyal

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,040
who i think has left now discussed

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,389
secure boot and k don't and he got three

00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,590
words into his presentation when

00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,890
everybody told him it was horrible and

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,490
he needed to do something different so

00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,710
horrible is not the right word is

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,630
complex but we're going to work on

00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,289
pushing the user space portions of k

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,839
execs green to kernel space and go

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,520
forward with that and and yes we have to

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,720
discuss more with eric and then the

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,370
final session was an overview of the

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,710
secure boot hibernate patches that the

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,089
Susa guy is V Julie Julie Berlin and

00:08:50,710 --> 00:09:00,160
boychik have done and it was well okay

00:08:54,089 --> 00:09:03,339
thank you next stop is Android hope you

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,600
go okay i'm sending in for john's Dalton

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:09,190
and zach so all right you know some

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,370
penguins need more love so we thought

00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:15,160
we'd graphics on the binder so

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,890
essentially the conclusion of that is

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,110
that you know the katy bus work that's

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,570
ongoing probably won't support bynars

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,010
semantics so essentially the conclusion

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,180
of that was you know let's stop next

00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,580
year when that's a little bit more

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,959
forward then there was a presentation

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,339
about the QT GUI d stuff this

00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,320
essentially for finer grained control

00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,779
over the stats and the control of what

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,150
apps can and cannot do in terms of

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,529
traffic there were some suggestions

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,120
about the way it's working so

00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:46,150
essentially to use looking instead of /

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,390
proc possibly looking at supporting see

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,070
groups instead of just you ids and look

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,130
at you know using n fq actually as a

00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:59,020
complete replacement of that and in

00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:03,190
terms of the QT a british qta to quote a

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,110
quota 30 seconds essentially the point

00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,610
there was a discussion about you know

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,880
whether fix it or actually completely

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,910
replace it regard to the gadget stuff so

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,890
the function FX functionality within

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:18,730
config-if has for gadget is actually

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,589
still works possibly moving the MTP

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,510
stuff in user space and there was no

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,870
objection to using actually can see

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:27,310
FS for the gadget stuff all right well

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,920
done five seconds to spare thank you

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:36,100
very much next up graphics and display

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,510
thank you so we had 45 double X in

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,030
graphic and display session the first

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,770
one was present but presented by a young

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,330
romantic about the state of our state of

00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:45,400
the art for debugging and tunics graphic

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,010
applications so we explained that this

00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,290
lots of soup all in Windows to do that

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,700
mostly vendor specific tools that even

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,410
wide view of the system but we don't

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,840
have that in Linux we have a small set

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,610
of tools that don't provide that wide

00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,200
view of your systems you can maybe just

00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,930
debug your own application but you can't

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,420
find out why this application doesn't

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,940
work properly with this compositor or

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,290
this window manager so we exchange

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,120
knowledge on the graphics debugging

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,950
environments for the different platforms

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,990
Android people contributed to that and

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:16,000
we need no need to explain graphic

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,100
debugging tunic frameworks then Rob

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,890
Clark gave brief summary of the opens or

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,180
graphics GPU projects on arm so it's the

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,750
current state of the reverse engineering

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:28,180
projects we went to the immediately

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,970
coding in composing topic that was

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,550
presented by Daniel stone explain why

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,830
egl and OMX provided by vendors are

00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,630
complete mess and why we should use the

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,480
harder overlays to do the coding

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,890
composing we get so big good in

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,320
understanding of the big picture of

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,580
composing and we need to now complete

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,860
the atomic and nuclear page flipping

00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,900
implementation splitting your MEMS

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,330
device notes the ad is to be able to use

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,850
GPGPU of with non-privileged

00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,620
applications we need mode setting knows

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,120
now it's going to mainline and not the

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,240
company's play framework well that's

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,160
pretty tough we got so many ways to

00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,980
implement that and we need to get it

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:10,180
mainline be fat century okay next up is

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,970
Android and graphics is that you again

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,580
give me the mic back I get a signal not

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,440
so Android graphics that was about while

00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,720
the first one was sync point in DMF

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,780
ofensas basically that's that's a way

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,590
that we can synchronize rendering and

00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,290
executions of different task with the

00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,510
GPU and CPU that to you two ways to do

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,240
that either explicit or implicit we we

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,580
get to understand why google thing

00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,620
that explicit sink parts are needed and

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,300
we pretty much agree on that so now we

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,070
have to find out how to implement sink

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,500
points the explicit sink parts are the

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,240
implicit vm of offenses Adam displayed

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,700
framework that's a proposal by Google

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,680
the proof can't said that replaces came

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,510
as an implementer graphic driver with or

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,820
without cameras at the moment so we get

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,920
a pretty good understanding now or why

00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,920
Android has issues we Came As I mean 2x

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,580
10 kms with the ADF the item a framework

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,170
features other KMS extensions we get we

00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,870
agreed on how to implement the life

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,580
source is right back and crap true plain

00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,790
extensions so we just have to do the

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,230
work now facing every death for the good

00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,060
thing is that there was absolutely no

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,940
opposition it's not leading Android it's

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,430
not much anyone so we just have to do it

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,959
and the last epic is iron which is a

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,500
memory manager and a locator thats used

00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:27,959
by android we will have to move it to to

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,820
staging we will share constraints lv

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,000
cold and the memory allocation code and

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,950
will address you used to spread APR last

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,579
okay 10 seconds per next up is

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:41,610
containers who's doing containers thank

00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:45,750
you for sending me your slides actually

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,899
it did synthesize but anyway so for the

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:52,350
cattle truck we started by an overview

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:56,279
of Alexei 1.0 which way is you in

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,560
February and it's been to have a lot of

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,550
new features and stability and would be

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,720
supported for five years after that I

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:08,760
demote Alexei on Android and explained

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,620
what it took to get Alexei walking with

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:17,490
Bionic we also add good to a good talk

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,170
on the vice namespaces and how to

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,209
basically run two versions of Android on

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,520
the same device and switch from one to

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,660
the other with some discussion that

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,820
happen after that google also explained

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,120
are they are using see groups in january

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,480
and the AC group air hockey to privatize

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,040
processes and allocate resources there

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:44,480
also hear that some of that code will be

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:48,180
open source very soon 30 seconds

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,460
it's not too good for memory also a

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:56,400
rackspace presented their work on open

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,930
visit working on nova cigrip Iraqi there

00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,150
was some talk of tsukuba yaki there was

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,090
also talk about trying to get up and

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,490
visit and Alexei to walk together and

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,730
maybe get up and visits using the lady

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,640
Alexei library and I feel that's rough

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:18,510
in it ok we'll take that next up is

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:21,180
going to be virtualization thank you so

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,850
our first talk was on getting VTB I'm

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,300
merged into qmu after it has been in Zen

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,770
for almost eight years so I think there

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,780
was some progress made and getting it

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,280
across the grumpy maintainer and by the

00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,010
end of the talk we had come up with a

00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,260
plan for moving forward the second talk

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,090
was how to work around the fact that the

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,910
file system freeze API does not actually

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:43,800
work very well today NTT is carrying a

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,620
number of patches that implement a brand

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,630
new interface based on some discussions

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,770
this week it sounds like there's some

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,380
progress made there and hopefully

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,990
alviero will be more open to merging

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,520
some of the work BFI over platform

00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,580
devices there was a lot of discussion

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,250
about how to enable pass through of non

00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:05,730
bus devices both with a CPI and with

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,950
device tree it sounds like sisyphus is

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:12,630
the way to do it by using the pass

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:13,800
within sofas f sis FS verdi Owens n

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,460
there was a discussion about how to

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,350
enable verdi o on top of Zen photos has

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,060
been planned for many many years I think

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,620
by the end of the talk we had come up

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,230
with a approach that we could all agree

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,860
upon and finally there was a talk about

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:30,420
enabling efi on Zen as a host I think

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,550
the common consensus was that grub to

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,320
upstream is awful and that the distros

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,820
are carrying hundreds of patches so it

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,380
turns out all the work that was done to

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,970
enable that has already been done in

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,460
that we should all just use the distro

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,780
versions of grub and that's it ok so

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,780
it's like let's spare well done

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:54,580
next up is scaling next up isn't scaling

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,770
okay hi there so we had the scaling

00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,690
micro conference and it started off with

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,910
an ax clean talking about the updates in

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,790
Intel's transactional memory extensions

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,040
the good news is that the colonel is

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,420
quite scalable already and quite well

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,480
optimized but I guess you already knew

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,940
that user space is a much richer target

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,280
we had Frederick talk about the current

00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,530
status of dynamic pics so which is not

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,420
the same as Nicholas we still need to

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:24,580
have at z equal to 1 and I guess they

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:26,980
are the plan is to remove that that

00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,960
constraint we talked about user we had

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,020
alternate from google talk about how the

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,000
multiplex user threads onto single

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:38,410
thread and if you have low overhead

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,740
thread switching and so on we had Tim

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,390
Chen and Dave Hanson talk about various

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,550
scalability issues that they have hit

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,160
the Linux kernel they had this you know

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,570
long bucket list of things that they

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,240
want to be fixed up and what they're

00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,730
looking at we had a few lightning talks

00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:00,040
and because we were running out of time

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:03,760
we have cycles we had another buff where

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:07,000
we talked about stuff like how to detect

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,240
bugs in our see you and in Google guys

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,670
talked about user space per CPU Atomics

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,340
which was harvesting they have promised

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,660
to release the core sometime soon okay

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:26,410
five seconds to spare thank you very

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:28,270
much next up is a CPI ok so for SRV we

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:29,920
had some interesting issues that we

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,280
talked about with the setup and teardown

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,620
of bf's and we found there's even more

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,620
probably be some work in that area

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:42,810
hot-plug both pcie native and a CPI

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:45,670
there's we believe that we're getting

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:49,330
settled on the OSC and getting that

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,460
place and Rafael pleased that the while

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,130
the event getting to each of those is

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,080
you

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,150
eek that it'll filter down to the same

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,930
code eventually and so that I expect him

00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:02,630
to do some work there for the legacy

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,820
p.m. probably the big thing that came

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,280
out of that is Rafael was thinking about

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,280
coalescing the config p.m. getting rid

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,810
of some of the sub p.m. big variables

00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,830
damn that sounds like there was a lot of

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:18,140
want for that the work that was done is

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,480
mostly in place converting drivers and

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,400
talked about how to go forward for the

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,530
PM settings the main issue is how to

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:29,200
describe dependency between 20 minutes

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:33,590
20 seconds and they're even and the

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:38,210
desire to export more p.m. info in CSS

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:39,530
was mentioned device tree was

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,750
interesting it seemed like there was a

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,400
lot of context already in place those of

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,160
us who didn't have that it was a little

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:49,100
hard to get in 10 seconds that they need

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:54,980
a method for divining key value data

00:19:49,100 --> 00:20:01,400
peers and that's back here next up is

00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:03,020
file systems so we had actually a really

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,520
interesting set of bookends for final

00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,680
systems of storage we started by talking

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,790
about persistent memory where we're

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,580
talking about millions and millions

00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,140
maybe 10 million iOS per second and the

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,000
observation is clearly we need to take

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,950
code out of the stack to actually scale

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,770
to that point and we also talked about

00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,780
SMR drives shingled drives which are say

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,400
a hundred iOS per second and we need to

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,320
put a lot of code back in the stack to

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,500
avoid touching them in ways they don't

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,800
like we had a session on copy offload

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,370
zach has patches the VFS layer that will

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,500
have been posted Rights Act refresh

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,660
using splice that we have patches from

00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,720
manifest which put the in a fascinating

00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,620
woman in it works on butter FS what

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,120
other file system just butter fest and

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,830
there are patches pending from martin

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,180
which should come any day now to enable

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:55,610
block we talked about fixing the scuzzy

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,110
mid layer to be faster we were trying to

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:01,940
heap abuse on James what he was hiding

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:03,050
in the universe seconds and had some

00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,770
lightning talks at the end of the day to

00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:07,670
talk about

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:10,250
some other issues ok screw 22 seconds to

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:18,140
spare one thank you next up is

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:21,050
automotive hi so we were the first time

00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,680
here the LPC and so it was kind of

00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:26,770
trying to get the automotive fork to

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,510
join the open source communities

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:32,390
hopefully I was not alone in the room

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:36,020
and so we had four interesting talks

00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:37,880
basically Daniel stone showed us what

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,370
the current situation is wayland in the

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,770
automotive world I gave some some

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,880
updates on where we are with with

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,040
network management concerning and good

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,860
news is that where the Android folks

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,820
have the same problem so the n fq stuff

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:58,400
will also be a part of calm and zoom we

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:02,000
had some discussion on how to detect

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,210
consumer devices this is not so trivial

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,880
but it seems like we're moving forward I

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,860
have not no sly story complete the

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,070
details okay I've given up beating up

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:15,200
people I've lost enthusiasm Oh me go

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:19,280
yeah solve that 30 seconds yeah it's it

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:25,340
ok ok thank you very much next up is

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:29,750
Putin 40 s so yeah we started out with

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,490
the 57 boot demo um this goes back to a

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,410
talk that I am fund event did a couple

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,480
of plumbers conferences ago where he

00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,070
showed how he modified his Linux to boot

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,170
in five seconds and we nowadays can do

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:43,040
that on commodity hardware with

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:45,440
full-blown distributions so the next

00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,000
thing was that the absurd guys talked a

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,920
bit about their own member what's coming

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,540
next verb start then we talked a little

00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,940
bit about zero configuration file system

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,360
discovering mounting which refers that

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,270
we want to may want to make a DCFS top

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,070
optional so that in on GPT dos we can

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,870
find ifsc automatically like discover

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,300
where / home and whether root disqus and

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,100
set it up yeah without requiring any

00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,430
further configuration or references from

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,810
the root filesystem one of the larger

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,910
topics we discussed was the single

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,440
control group saraiki and its relation

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,269
to system d there was certainly some

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,419
disagreement

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:22,029
but my saying at least we made clear

00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:24,219
like why what the reasons are and what

00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:25,809
the complexities behind that are very

00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:27,580
second talked a little bit about the

00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:30,909
bootloader spec which is supposed to be

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,739
a unification of how the configuration

00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,999
of boot loaders is done so that all the

00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,320
different boot loaders for the different

00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:37,509
architectures speaks the same thing and

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,309
everything becomes more drop-in based um

00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:40,809
and then we had a nice demo bar with

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,929
engine eggs and socket activation to

00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:46,419
drive up density of containers two ways

00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:48,129
that are otherwise not possible and we

00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:49,419
had a final down at demo of central

00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:51,700
logging resistive this journal and

00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:53,079
elastic search all done by the people

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:57,190
who I pansy and it was pretty amazing

00:23:53,079 --> 00:24:03,339
Mike back thank you very much next up is

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:06,129
network virtualization hey so we had

00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:08,679
Luigi talk about net map Colonel bypass

00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:11,709
collision bsd currently able to do 70

00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,349
gig switching we actually talked about

00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:16,269
oh yes good bad and ugly bottom line is

00:24:14,349 --> 00:24:18,459
pretty much that performs its ok could

00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:20,739
be better and we really need NAT we

00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:22,059
talked a little bit about the cost of

00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:24,149
the slow path and how we could possibly

00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:26,829
optimize it using harder offloading

00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:30,339
after that you had Alex propose an

00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:36,489
extension to BPF to replace the OBS flow

00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:37,779
lock up an action I'm mechanism after

00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:39,729
that we haven't had an introduction to

00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:42,820
the contrary router which is a

00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:53,769
replacement for 40 yes then we had Paul

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:56,789
talk about our TCP repair oops after

00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:59,320
that I second Alex talked about how to

00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:02,349
problems we faced with avoiding overlay

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,979
network such as changing UDP port sata

00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:10,089
seconds you Intel presented TP DK how to

00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:12,729
use it to improve OBS performance we had

00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:16,559
an introduction from Kyle on less nala

00:25:12,729 --> 00:25:19,929
or late networking solution and solution

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,579
service training we hadn't talked from

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,950
chassis door we estimated on or via

00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:26,769
stack integration possible integration

00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:29,139
of connection tracking we had a child

00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:29,860
talk about a switch management through

00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:32,350
bc is

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:37,630
and you had a nice introduction on Linux

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:39,190
network is back thank you next up is

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:45,160
going to be power but not slide

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:49,210
efficient share dueling okay I actually

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:52,150
sent this lights twice okay we have time

00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,799
yes unofficial share dearly yeah the

00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:56,140
purpose of the ease of this mark

00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:58,030
conference was basically to get him go

00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,470
to talk together our power efficient

00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,150
scheduling and what they were doing so

00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,030
we had four interesting presentations

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,919
the first one was by van song from De

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,610
Niro he was talking about task packing

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,669
and and how that can help it also

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:14,740
touched upon how to use part apology

00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:17,530
information in the scheduler the

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,140
following presentation by tucka and

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:22,390
Daniel from De Niro was talking about

00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,549
the cpu idle and how we can improve that

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:29,320
using schedule information there are

00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:31,570
some interesting things around that the

00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,419
third presentation was but Paul McKenna

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:37,270
from IBM he talked about optimizing our

00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:38,980
see you for big little systems very

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,799
interesting talk as well and the last

00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:46,780
person tation was by myself where I was

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:49,330
30 seconds proposing a unified power a

00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,510
framework that could sort of integrate

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,980
the existing frameworks in a nicer way

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,950
that actually got fairly well received

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,380
by by a lot of parties so that was in it

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:05,580
there was a really good outcome okay

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:08,260
that's it 40 seconds to spare robot and

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,460
apparently it was chair inefficient

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,770
scheduling that didn't get that

00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,450
presentation and so we're sorry we also

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,480
did have a bit of a up with the

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,040
send send presentations to contact at

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,210
the contacts at mailing list was

00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,590
actually designed to strip all

00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,630
attachments so we didn't get any

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,429
presentations then we had to run around

00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,790
trying to get them again so it was

00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:29,440
definitely very inefficient do have a

00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,090
couple more announcements just before we

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,669
get on to the final slide which is about

00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,500
plumbers next year that is that the

00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:36,640
buses will begin returning from the

00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,640
venue for those of you who are

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,679
lightweights at eight-thirty p.m. but it

00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,590
is in fact also a fairly easy walk from

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,340
that here it's about a mile

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,960
just up poydras street and there's

00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,390
another announcement for Stephanie that

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,640
apparently several people who want one

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,860
the Texas Instruments raffle for beagle

00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,620
boards didn't pick them up so if you

00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,250
fail to get to reception before I do you

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,870
lose them and with that it only remains

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,029
to announce the somewhat controversial

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,220
decision for we're plumbers will be next

00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:11,370
year so next year we're going to

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:15,299
actually be trying moving out of the

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:17,159
state's going to Europe Dussel Dorf was

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,289
about the most boring city in Germany we

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:29,580
could find but we assume your job will

00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:31,200
be to make it interesting it is expected

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,470
to be co-located with lunes con Europe

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,750
that's not so with that remember buses

00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,990
begin leaving from here at six-thirty or

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,549
you begin assembling buses probably 645

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,710
thanks for participating enjoy the party

00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:45,179
drink responsibly and I don't want

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,370
anyone to be sick in the toilets like

00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:50,299
they were last time thank you very much

00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,299
