Title: LPC 2020: Session Leads training
Publication date: 2020-08-21
Playlist: LPC2020 - Live Streams
Description: 
	This training is intended to familiarize ourselves with the LPC 2020 platform. Questions are welcomed and encouraged.

Several of you are new to Linux Plumbers and have taken it upon
yourself to lead a microconference on the topic you are an expert in. I sincerely commend you on this task!

This year will be done a little different due to being a virtual event.
We will be holding two training sessions this week on how to run a
virtual microconference. This will be useful for all moderators, even if
you are not moderating a microconference, but are moderating a
presentation.

The Plumbers Code of Conduct will be in effect for this event. The event will be recorded.
