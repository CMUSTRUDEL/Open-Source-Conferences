Title: LPC 2020: Session Leads training
Publication date: 2020-08-21
Playlist: LPC2020 - Live Streams
Description: 
	This training is intended to familiarize ourselves with the LPC 2020 platform. Questions are welcomed and encouraged.

Several of you are new to Linux Plumbers and have taken it upon
yourself to lead a microconference on the topic you are an expert in. I sincerely commend you on this task!

This year will be done a little different due to being a virtual event.
We will be holding two training sessions this week on how to run a
virtual microconference. This will be useful for all moderators, even if
you are not moderating a microconference, but are moderating a
presentation.

The Plumbers Code of Conduct will be in effect for this event. The event will be recorded.

um i want to

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,639
uh thank everyone for coming um

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
without you guys uh there would be no

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,519
conference

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,040
and actually i i can't look at the

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
slides or look down my computer so i'm

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
so used to i have to like look up at the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,640
camera maybe we should move it over more

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,840
so it's more

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,520
centered there but um

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,359
i want to thank everyone because without

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
you guys there'd be no conference

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
it takes a lot of work to get people to

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,279
come to

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
get talks there to approve talks to get

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,640

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,000
and get micro conference all set up so

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,600
thank you very much

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
i also want to thank the sponsors

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,239
because again without the sponsors we

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
also would not have

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,920
um a conference as well and you know

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,360
diamond sponsor is facebook so thank you

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,840
very much

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
and uh platinum we have netapp ibm

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,239
western digital

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,600
gold arm microsoft off azul and for cash

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,559
boxes you know we don't really have

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,440
catch boxes but

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,440
hey um

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,600
uh silver amd red hat and of course um

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
this is also a lot of help from the lynx

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,400
foundation

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,560
so let me start going through um ah

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,040
a pop-up is coming up and it can't get

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,520
there there we go i already mentioned

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,520
all this

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439
uh anti-harassment policy is in effect

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,560
we have a code of conduct and we plan

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,600
being very strict with it it's also up

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,280
to the moderators to help enforce this

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,640
so basically it comes down to

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
everyone should be nice to each other

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
there should be no insults no name

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
calling

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,079
no one should feel uncomfortable that

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
they're being bullied or any of that

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,000
that said we also want a technical

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,360
discussion to go on so

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,600
it's okay to tell someone they're wrong

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,880
please back it up with evidence of why

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,399
they are wrong

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
a technical conference will have

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
arguments you will have different

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,840
or people coming up different ideas and

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
they're going to fight

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
to get their ideas to win and to do that

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,719
you will have confrontation

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,239
but let's make it civil um everything

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,720
should be specific on

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
uh make it technical back up with

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,080
evidence

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,000
uh when you say look according to when i

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,840
apply your patch or something

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,920
this breaks that's wrong so

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,280
basically uh still keep it really

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
technical but everyone be nice to each

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,920
other and i'll come back more about that

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,160
later on in the discussion

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
uh housekeeping now these slides in the

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,480
beginning are basically going to be the

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,000
slides that everyone has in the

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
beginning so please

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,440
uh say you know say thanks to our

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,440
sponsors and everyone

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
but uh one thing we want to do to run

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,080
this conference uh

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,000
there's gonna be some uh policies that

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,280
we're gonna have in place for everyone

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and first thing is keep your cameras off

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,280
um unless you want to talk so basically

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
when you turn your camera on that's

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,720
basically

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
saying raising your hand and saying i

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,879
have something to say

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,840
so keep your cameras off uh and that

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,400
goes with this

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
training as well it's it's okay to be

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
interactive

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,319
you can stop me at any time just turn

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680
your camera on i know you want to come

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
up and say something and then i'll let

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,440
you speak

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,640
um so that's the idea also if you notice

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
when you logged in there's

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,680
two modes to log in by there's a listen

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
only mode and

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,720
a microphone mode

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,239
right now we're using big blue button

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
and we're trying to do everything in

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,360
open source

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
and we have resources behind this but

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
there's limitations on how

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,959
how much this can scale and we want to

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
let people know that

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,280
there's actually three ways to

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,599
participate or to be involved in the

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,440
next plumbers uh the first two is what

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,120
you saw the microphone and listen mode

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
a third way is we have everything so i

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,400
have a youtube channel channel that we

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,599
will post links to in fact this talk

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,040
right now has a

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,879
youtube channel that's in the chat if

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,799
you go look in the chat you'll find

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,120
the link to this uh talk going on right

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,280
now um

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,879
if basically i tell people if you go to

00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
a market conference or a talk or

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
whatever

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,080
and if you don't really care about you

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,680
know the conversations going on you just

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,040
are interested in what's maybe you must

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,599
want to skim through things and see

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
things

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,640
look at the youtube channels go look at

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,680
that see if there's something you like

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
in there that's something you want to

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,680
watch

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
but if you want to participate at least

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
see the conversations going on in the

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,919
chat

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
join in listen only mode that's if you

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,720
don't have anything you know you don't

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,080
really think you're going to

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
talk you're not going to be part of the

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
conversation but you might have a

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
question or something that could be

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,280
answered in chat you might want to be

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
watching the chat

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,560
join listen only mode and if you

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,199
actually think you might actually say

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
something or

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
you feel that you're pretty confident

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
that you're going to have a discussion

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,240
join micro

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,040
microphone mode um

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
this is the reason why we do this is

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
because the listen only mode

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
is a lot less strain on the servers uh

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,479
it will give everyone a better

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,919
um experience to the conference if they

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
if most people come in listen only mode

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,800
if a lot of people come in

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
microphone mode but don't say anything

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
even though they're on mute

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
it still drains the servers and it might

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,800
cause a little bit more

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,520
overhead on the back end and we want to

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,440
make sure that

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,240
the system is well

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
there's 900 people registered for this

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,199
uh plumbers it's

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
basically the biggest registration we've

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,680
ever had it's not a live event we're

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,880
all at our homes or wherever and doing

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
this virtual

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,400
but the servers that from what we've

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,320
heard they've never been

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,759
every no room has basically had more

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,680
than 200 people

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,039
so with 900 people there's a chance that

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
one room or two room might have more

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,880
than 200 people

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
and we don't know exactly how well the

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,400
you know everything will work

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,919
at that scale so this is why if

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,199
everyone's in listen only mode we're

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,120
assuming that it's not gonna be an issue

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,400
but everyone joins in microphone mode

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
and turn on their cameras there

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
definitely will be an issue so

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
keep the cameras off unless you want to

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,080
say something and i guess

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,520
that's enough for that slide

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,639
planning committee um i have to say i

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,440
had i had i'm like really impressed with

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,199
this committee um i really believe we

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,199
pulled off the impossible

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,400
when we said we're going to virtual we

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,840
had no

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,360
clue and that was what back in april

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
march april time frame we're saying

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,240
we're going we're we're not doing live

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,000
we're going virtual

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
or i think may is when we finally made

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,440
the final decision

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
we started scrambling back then looking

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
at platforms and mediums and

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,960
and we were like we also wanted to stay

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
open source we didn't want to go to a

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,840
proprietary

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,080
uh system back end people pulled it off

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,520
i am super impressed with everyone on

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,560
the committee

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,479
i really want to state you know john

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,680
and gee really um went above and beyond

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,400
to pull out the platform uh and everyone

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,479
else has done

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,080
tremendous job but i want to thank

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,199
everyone about that

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,080
i'm impressed i i i told like john or

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
something like that but it's me i

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,800
wouldn't be able to pull this off

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,080
so they there's a lot of work

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,680
so um what does it

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
mean to be a moderator especially for

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
microconference runners uh moderators uh

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,680
basically it's up to you to make this a

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
successful conference

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
uh you guys being moderator means you

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
have all power and

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,800
uh g always likes to mention the peter

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,800
parker principle you know with

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,080
great power comes great responsibility

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
and that's true we're giving you great

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,720
power you actually have

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
all basically all the um administrative

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
rights

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,120
that we have when you go when you're

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,720
joined as moderator you kick people off

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
you could block people you could

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,479
you know take presentations um so that's

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
all of you and when you look at the um

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,199
well i'm looking down in

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,400
uh i guess mikhail is not a moderator

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,880
i could tell by the circle on his if you

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,199
look at

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,879
the user list it all the squares are

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,840
moderators the circles will be

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,319
uh viewers only so let me talk about the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
different

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
um well what's the word i want to use

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,199
the different

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
um i can't think of the word right now

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,759
but

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,160
uh was that

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,120
privileges privileges well i wasn't

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,479
asking more roles

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,840
i think probably different yeah roles or

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,720
that people have so the moderator has

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,680
the biggest

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,639
is basically the one that can um mute

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
people

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,199
can kick people out can give presenters

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
can make other people moderators can

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,440
demo

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
people from moderator to non-moderator

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
so right here you know mikael is not a

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,520
moderator so i might

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
you know promote him to a moderator so

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,440
now he's a moderator so

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,760
um but then there's us hello yeah i

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
should

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
be a moderator uh because uh on android

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,560
uh

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,680
security microconference uh so wait you

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,120
should be a moderator should not be a

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,080
moderator yeah

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,040
i should be able yes so i think gee we

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,040
probably just have to

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,399
set you up to be one um

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,640
thank you i'm happy to do that right now

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
yep so although i promoted you to

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
moderator right now you're only

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
moderator for this session once you log

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,320
off and log in again you're not gonna be

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
a moderator unless we do something

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,680
so moderator has power in all this but

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,839
then what we also have is a presenter

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,880
now a moderator isn't the presenter but

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,160
can take presenter

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
and become the presenter now what a

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,600
presenter does is the one has control of

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,600
presenting so you have the slide deck

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,680
you can see the slides you can

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,760
modify the slides you can share your

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,160
screen you can

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,120
show videos that's everything that a

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
presenter has

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,160
and anyway and you can make a viewer a

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
presenter so

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,200
that's actually what the moderator's job

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,279
is is to decide

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,480
who is going to present and select them

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,480
as presenter and they have

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
full control and i will show some demos

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,120
later on but

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,360
um the presenter also has the power to

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,640
upload slides and i believe what we're

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,560
going to do is we're going to open up

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,160
every room one hour before

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,720
the conference starts so the moderators

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,279
could come in and upload all the slides

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
for that whole for their whole session

00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,839
that way

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
it's really really easy to switch from

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,320
slide to slide to slide

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,760
it's easier than your own laptop um so

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
that way things will switch over and all

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,160
you do is you switch slides and then you

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
give someone presenter and then they

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,519
have full control

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,640
uh we'll talk more about that later so

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,399
uh and a viewer

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
just sits back and watches and could

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,519
talk and that's basically all they have

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,040
so that's those are the

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,040
three roles that everyone will have

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,560
um i want to talk a little bit about

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,680
what is a micro conference i'm trying to

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,360
see yeah there's some people here

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,839
running micro conferences

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,160
um if you um let me do something real

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,440
quick

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,640
i'm going to ask a question who

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
here i would say if you've run if you

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,320
ran a microconference before

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
select yes if you have not run a

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
microconference before

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,760
select no and if you're running a track

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,959
and you've done it before you select yes

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
if you've running a track you've never

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,560
done it before

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,240
select no so there everyone should have

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,120
a poll that popped up

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,399
um and let's see i think everyone has

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,839
done this before then

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,480
so far i have three yeses

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,480
and three those yeah john

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,560
yep okay elena yep so actually so

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,880
let you know this is full disclosure uh

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,200
the polls are not anonymous

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
uh whoever starts a poll could see

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,240
everyone's answers so i could see who

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,000
said what who hasn't answered um so

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
just be aware and you i would suggest

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
that when you do polls let people know

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
that

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,120
by the way it's not anonymous but when i

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
do um

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,560
go in and let's see if i could

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
publish the results it's anonymous it

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,399
doesn't tell anyone else

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,279
who said yes who said no but from here

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,800
according to this

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
four people said no three people said

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,480
yes so

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,320
let me talk about what a micro

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,320
conference is

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,680
a microconference is not a presentation

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
it's not something where you go and you

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,360
show the latest thing

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,639
or what you or the latest product or

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
what you have done

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,000
it's not a place to show off micro

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
conferences

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,399
are for where you're stuck where you

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,279
don't know how to go further

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,760
you have a problem you have a question

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
there's

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,480
issues uh new apis coming out you want

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,200
to have a discussion

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,480
microconferences are about discussion uh

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,000
the reason why we call it plumbers is to

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,959
get a bunch of people to come in

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,079
and be able to discuss and talk talk to

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,279
people that you don't normally get a

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
chance to talk to

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,560
that's the beauty about plumbers is the

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,279
fact that there's a lot of people from

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,399
different aspects of the linux ecosystem

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,839
that you could come in

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
and talk to that you don't normally get

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,880
to talk to and you get different

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,320
perspectives and get different outlooks

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,839
and get different solutions

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,480
that might work better than what you

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,000
could come up alone so everything in a

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
micro conference is about

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,360
solving a problem so i always tell

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,160
people once people submit topics to a

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
microconference

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
they should never submit an abstract

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
they should submit a problem statement

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
what do you want to have solved now

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
there are certain

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,040
topics that i think is maybe not that

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
much of a discussion like one

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,120
topic at the real time microconference

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,760
is always thomas klechner giving his

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,200
status to the up you know status of real

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,720
time and upstreaming

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,079
and basically i still say that's a

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,680
discussion because it gets a chance

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
everyone to say why isn't real time

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,680
upstream yet

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,399
so it's a fun it's a fun time so that we

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,399
let that one slide

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,320
um by the way uh here's a good exam

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,720
time i'm going to talk about is the um

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,800
the slides this slide here has the links

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
for presenter guide moderator guide

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,240
mcleads everything i suggest downloading

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,200
all of these

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,639
and reading them they're very useful i

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,959
believe gee i think you wrote most of

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,320
these

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,839
or at least took it from something you

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,560
wrote them up you did a really great job

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,600
on them

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
um i think maybe uh john helped out on

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
that as well

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,000
but if you want to know this instead of

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,600
i know i think in the chat

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,800
uh i believe gee posted um

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,720
the links to these as he did but also in

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,320
case you want to look download this

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,680
slide and have it remember so say if you

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,399
don't want to click on the links in the

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
chats

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,920
i can stay here and i'll show this in a

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,360
demo

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,120
but i'm going to change it so that

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,639
down here if you can see my little red

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
dot by the way that's just me

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
putting my mouse over the slide and it

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,160
looks like a laser pointer

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,440
i come down here there's this little

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,040
download

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
arrow there that everyone should have on

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,800
their screen click on that

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
and it'll download these slides so

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,440
you'll get to

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,440
have this slide because of that download

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
monday is the conference we're starting

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,760
monday we're starting at 2 p.m

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,680
utc um for you know

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
for those on the east coast of the

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,920
americas

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,399
um that's 10 p.m or 10 a.m sorry 10 a.m

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,040
and it's 7 a.m for those on the west

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,079
coast

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,639
um and figure out the times

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,920
for everyone else uh it's going to be

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,680
four hours

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,600
uh for the microconferences and we

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,480
suggest that uh you have

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,680
at least two breaks two 15-minute breaks

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,680
uh there's been reports

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,760
have been studies about uh conference

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,120
fatigue especially in a virtual event

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
uh everyone's gonna be sitting there in

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,639
front of their uh

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
uh camera in front of you know i guess

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,560
cameras in front of their computer

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,320
screens

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,600
for hours we're used to that but now

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,839
we're all engaged and

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,079
it's it's not the same as this normal

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,399
human it could be quite exhausting so

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,440
uh we really recommend having at least

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,079
two breaks

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
also the schedule's out uh those that

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
have

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,680
are in charge of micro conferences you

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,680
can still kind of

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,079
accept topics right now and ma and put

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,839
them in your in your uh

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,279
in your slots but please look at the

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
schedule see what else is being

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,639
uh suggested and try not to get topics

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,320
that might be overlaid so

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
and once you finish your schedule which

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
we're hoping you do by the end of this

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
week

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
that you stick to it uh stay with the

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,680
time frame and that

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
um when you that way that someone's

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
looking at they want to talk

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
see a specific topic for your

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
microconference they know when to come

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
in

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,440
um i think i'll talk a little bit more

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,000
about that let's see here yeah well

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,440
here's

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,279
the tentative schedule i don't know if

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,279
we updated this

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,880
uh i think the slide after we've had

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,800
attentive schedule i think this

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,480
things might have changed but if you

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,920
probably know the final one but the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,440
final one is posted now

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,440
this was your strategy for the previous

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,360
ones it says so in the title

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,959
right so let's see here

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
okay this is the part i wanted to talk

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,600
about

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,600
so the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
when you schedule your topics uh like i

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,240
said it's three and a half

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,880
uh three and a half hours of actual time

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
to do

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,480
your uh microconference with the you

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,240
know four hours

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
minus two 15-minute breaks that's three

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,240
and a half hours so if you have

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,120
30-minute uh topics that gives you seven

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
topics

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
stick to that give whatever time you

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,680
have try to stick to it even if the

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
topic's going really really well

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,000
and at the end you don't really want to

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,120
stop it because the conversation is

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,880
going really

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,880
really good and you don't want to stop

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,839
the flow we have

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,440
other aspects to move like move it to so

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,480
we have hack rooms i believe we now have

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,680
six hack rooms i

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,799
forgot to count how many was it

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,880
well it's five right now but change

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,240
yeah we may add more if if we find out

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
they're all full and we have the

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,520
bandwidth maybe we'll add another

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,520
and yes um

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,600
i we i have it too

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,520
and then you know after you get that so

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,360
you get to tell people

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,120
you know and then this is those that got

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,960
the speaker's gift

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:37,679
and when they're done

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,840
um so

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,520
if okay key i think you mentioned that

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,960
you have the pdfs or something for these

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
that if they don't have the speaker's

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,600
gift that they could download these and

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
print them out

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,280
it's mentioning the moderator's guide

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,480
itself so if you go there there's a link

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,440
to a shared folder

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,760
and the templates for those in us later

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,000
and a4 is available

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,840
we can just put them in the website

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
itself with the other graphic stuff like

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,799
the

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,360
the slide templates and the t-shirt sure

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,799
sure

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
i didn't want to make it too public

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,760
because it really isn't that relevant

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
for participants and i didn't want

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,760
random people to have them so they would

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
just start interrupting microconferences

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,679
by putting them up so

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,200
that's why i parked them there so you

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,960
have to read the moderator's guide to

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,320
see where those are so we don't end up

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,080
with random people

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,080
doing this when it's not time to do this

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
yeah yeah although you're kind of hard

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,919
to hear too so

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,600
um anything else you want to mention

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,960
elena

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,960
okay um

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:42,160
yeah so basically if when the time is up

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,799
you move everything to a hack room that

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,679
way

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,200
you don't have to worry about um or the

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
time slots and everyone else will get

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,320
time

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,600
so just say this topic's going well you

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,679
guys can move off to

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,679
the hack room but we have to go on to

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
the next topic uh the moderators you're

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,799
the ones you could take

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,559
presentation away from people you could

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,480
make them stop so that's your job to

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,720
make sure everything goes smoothly

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
also another your job is that i want to

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
bring up is if someone's talking and

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,600
they you can't hear them well

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,200
let them know that come in and say by

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,280
the way we can't hear you can you

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,360
uh update um maybe you know

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,880
to have them move their mic sometimes a

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,080
lot of times especially if people don't

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,160
use a microphone

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,400
uh headset they use their computer

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,760
microphone i found out that that seems

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,039
to be the most distortion

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,039
a lot that the microphone on a laptop

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,559
that they use that or a computer it's

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
always usually very distorted a lot of

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,400
times people have their microphone

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,600
full blast and it really gets distorted

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,280
so if they lower the

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,440
volume it gets better it's up to the

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
moderator to let people know

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
please change your microphone you know

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
so because they don't know i mean i

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,600
don't know

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,480
what i sound like on your computers so

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
i'm assuming

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,600
i sound awesome because these headsets

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,120
are so awesome

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,799
thank you ghee there

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,160
so again your job is to make sure

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,160
everything runs smoothly

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,440
uh here okay the fun part the

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,200
capabilities

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
now for the quick demo of everything you

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
have this is where i get to share my

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,039
screen and kind of give you

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,799
ideas of what to do um let's see

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,760
so if i go and down i guess share my

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,520
screen

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,000
i want to remind everybody that's here

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,360
that please interrupt steve if you have

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
any questions while he's showing

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,720
something if something is of interest to

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,640

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,760

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,480
where you're clicking what button where

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,640
in the screen

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,320
when you just start a poll i'm just

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840
about to i'm going to show you a demo

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,760
right now so you guys get to see

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,400
everything i'm doing because once i

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,880
click here share my screen

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
so you should be able to see my screen

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,080
right about

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,919
now it's a good illustration that it

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,000
does take a few seconds it's a lot of

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,400
data that gets streamed over so

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
temp temporize yourself give yourself a

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,080
few seconds 5-10 seconds before the

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
shared screen appears everywhere else

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,919
and

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,400
it made it all the way to the youtube

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,720
live channel so you can go ahead

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,760
okay so here i switched i'm right now in

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,280
hack room two

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,240
so so i'm not in the same thing because

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,760
if i go to or i mean i'll switch back to

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,919
here and now i get the whole

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,520
you know thousand mirror effect so i

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,440
going into heck room two

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,559
i logged in as a trainee on another

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,559
computer to

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,799
say just to show that there's a user

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,840
there you guys can see my mouse right

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,280
yes okay so here so now here's some

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,720
things first of all i noticed the hacrum

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,600
2 didn't have a default

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,159
um presentation i clicked on that and i

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,520
got this

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,960
oh was that do we change something we uh

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,799
if you read your email you'll see that

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,480
we're the committee is finalizing the

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,480
review of the default slide deck and we

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,039
will upload that later today or tomorrow

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
so we are the slides are being reviewed

00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,840
and the ones you saw

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,440
here i just uploaded myself but we are

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,120
just finalizing them

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,720
okay i wrote them so basically people

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,440
are going through typos right now

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,559
right so i'm going to go in here and say

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
let's say

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,080
by the way this is what i see as a

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,640
viewer now if i go

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,480
and i want to set this trainee as the

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
viewer use i click on the left mouse

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,679
button

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,280
um i could start a private chat make

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
presenter click there now they have a

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,400
presenter you notice

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
buttons here lost from me i can no

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,480
longer i'm no longer in charge

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,600
of the slides or the presentation or

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,840
sharing my screen

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,799
on this thing because the trainee is

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,080
here so

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,159
i'm going to actually if you click on

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,360
the little plus here i could take

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,120
presenter

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,880
which i now got my power back because

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,720
because i'm a moderator i can do that

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,320
people are not moderator cannot take

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,760
presenter from you

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,880
um let's see so i'm going to upload

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
slides so if you click

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,960
now on this i have more actions i could

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
start a poll that's where you saw when i

00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,159
clicked here

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,520
i said yes or no and yes or no

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:07,200
um let's see i'm down here

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,120
pulling option yes and then i see over

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
here that trainee said yes

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,559
there's the option published results and

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,400
that's okay

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,320
that's what we mean by the pulling

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
results not being anonymous you can see

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
the answer to users of ferrari right

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,880
here

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,679
yep right there i see the trainee

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,840
anonymous

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,919
said yes so that's why i let people know

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,120
that i can see your answers some people

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
maybe may not want to say something if

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,679
they know what you're going to say so be

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,919
careful what you ask

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,200
um when i sit by the way i'll just go

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,600
about the poll real quick

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,039
i have some default polls true or false

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,400
a b abc

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,799
d e i could also create a custom poll

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,799
you know

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,039
well anyway i said is it fun until i get

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,679
three different things start calls and

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
pull

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,120
if i go down here i see three different

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
answers with different things there's a

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:04,480
custom poll you could add there

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,600
um go back here i responded no it is not

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,960
so uh

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,720
we'll talk more about this in a little

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,039
bit i see gui is joining

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,320
um i wanted to add a webcam there so

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,279
people can see

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,000
what the screen looks like with a with a

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,120
webcam

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
on top yep because you can there's a

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,039
very well hidden feature that if you

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
grab between the presentation area

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,960
and the slides so right here just below

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,799
my you can actually resize so if you

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
want to maximize the size of the screen

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,679
share as a viewer when you do that

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,840
you actually can slide up and slide down

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,760
or maximize the content minimize the

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,039
slides so

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,480
those are some of the features that will

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,080
take a while to get used to for all of

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,159
the users but eventually it gets pretty

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,559
comfortable there's ways to focus people

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,320
there's ways to maximize certain users

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,000
or focus on the content you can remove

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
all of it that's a lot of me on that

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,840
screen

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,400
and you can manipulate all of that

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
so invite your users if you're doing a

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,640
detailed demonstration that's just a

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,039
small terminal

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
remember the font size is never too big

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,840
and and

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,679
invite them to maximize the the screen

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,279
share area or the slide so they can read

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,760
comfortably what what you're wanting

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,559
them to

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
to see and be able to read and i do want

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,640
to state

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
this is something that some stay on

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,840
there and gee so just so you know a lot

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,520
of people want to say like how

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,120
i lost how do i get the presentation i

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,279
don't see the presentation you got to

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,320
tell them down at the right corner here

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,760
is restore presentation and

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,600
there you get to see the presentation

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,480
back i've actually had some people ask

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,919
me like

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,760
when i join in like i don't see a

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,880
presentation they didn't realize that

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
they had to click on that

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,960
little notion there so if you minimize

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
the slides or the screen you got to hit

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,919
that button to come back it's not always

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,799
that obvious

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,159
um if you notice as i mouse over you the

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,600
red dot follows like i said that's like

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,240
a laser pointer there

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,960
uh the those was it the other one i want

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,440
to talk about oh

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,600
uploading so let me upload some slides

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,640
so i click on here and i could upload a

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
presentation

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,279
you'll see here's the current default

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,520
now i'm going to say

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,520
see browse let's do

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:15,440
these slides and

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,120
i could say upload but right now let's

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,159
say i don't want to keep the current

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,279
slide going

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,480
and hit upload so i'm actually uploading

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,960
another deck of slide slides

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,080
and reason why i'm showing you this is

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,919
that when it's done

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,960
should be done hello

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,000
you can just click close oh yeah oh

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,159
upload oops close okay so

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,679
reason why i'm showing that is let's say

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,640
let let me switch actually let me switch

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,400
back to

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
uh upload presentation i'm going to

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,720
switch to those slides

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,400
um yeah

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,159
that's where it says upload usually says

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,240
confirm doesn't it yes it should say

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,400
yeah your client may be a little too

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,799
busy and the ui didn't refresh

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,720
this is a pretty intensive html5 app

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,279
that you're using so having few of them

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,279
open

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,559
it may have chosen not to do the right

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,559
thing so

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,600
let's say i'm in the middle of talking

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,440
or someone's talking about the

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,760
anti-harassing

00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,240
policy and you're and then someone comes

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,960
to and goes oh i just updated my slides

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,360
here's the new pdf file uh can you add

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,840
them

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,039
i'm next so you need now to upload

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,120
someone else's slides but

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,640
you want to do it now you don't want to

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,919
you know wait you don't want to spend

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,120
time uploading them

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,039
but if you know the person is going to

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,000
be on the slide for a while

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,640
so let's say if the trainee is saying

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
they're

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,679
talking and someone sends me their

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,960
slides

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,200
and i want to upload them while they're

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
talking on the slide i would go down

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,440
here and say take presenter

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
so no one notices anything i just took

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,559
presenter from the trainee the trainee

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
will notice that his things change but

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,880
maybe you want to say

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,799
hey trainee i want i have to upload

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,760
some slides just continue talking i'm

00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,559
going to take presenter i'll give it

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,760
back to you

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,240
and then you go upload presentation um

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,120
let me

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,880
oops hello oops that's the wrong button

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,919
upload presentation

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
browse uh documents let me just pick

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,520
something

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,520
one of my edf is there open this

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,559
okay so i sit there say upload

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,919
now notice this little circle there this

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,520
is important

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,520
the person that's giving the

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,080
presentation right now is on

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,120
whatever says current so i would make

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,200
sure i select

00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,120
current so nothing will change while i

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,039
do this operation

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,679
but this is to be uploaded now when i

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:41,360
hit upload it's uploading the next

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,120
slides it's converting the file

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,720
i guess it doesn't like that file so

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,840
also let you know i believe

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,559
if i understand this correctly um

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,120
open office is the back end for this so

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,679
you could

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,960
whatever openoffice could read you big

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,880
big blue button could read

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,240
but it will convert it to a pdf before

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
it displays it so

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,360
if you have a pdf it doesn't do the

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,279
conversion although

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,559
obviously it did here maybe didn't like

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,600
that pdf but

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,440
if it has a pdf you can see that

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,200
it's best to use that and not have to

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,399
waste the server energy to do the

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
conversion for you

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,799
but you noticed when it came back this

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,679
person's still trainees going and i

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,640
go back and say make presenter and no

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,279
one noticed

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,480
no one was bothered the fact that i took

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,399
presenter

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,159
uploaded some slides and gave it back

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,399
it's key is you got to make sure you

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,679
remember to click that current otherwise

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,880
when it uploads and finishes it'll

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
switch over to

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,039
the slides you just uploaded so do not

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,600
do that now when this trainee is all

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,799
done

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,279
he's finished all the slides you could

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,320
give

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,600
you could say take presenter go back to

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,480
upload a presentation

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,720
now i want to talk here and i'm going to

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
upload and now i got the next slides

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,320
already and then when i'm

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,840
then i go back to to the next presenter

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,279
and make them the presenter and that's

00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,279
how quick it is

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,720
right now that's one percent one

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,399
presenter to the next presenter

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,760
like i said this is quicker than even if

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,360
you have the same laptop

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,279
because a lot of times it's this is

00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,120
harder than just up

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,799
running uh pdf so i mean this is easier

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,520
than running just pdfs

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,880
uh also if you notice though i'm gonna

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,320
take presenter again

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,360
upload presentation um if i wanted

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,039
people to download

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,559
as i did for you so current you'll see

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,559
current is the elc print k

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,240
talk i gave right here you'll see this

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,039
little download things i click on it and

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,000
it turns

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,880
that the slash goes away and now if i

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,480
hit upload

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,720
you'll notice down here is the little

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
download sign so that's what i did when

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,039
i told everyone

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,720
hey you could download these slides i

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,679
went and clicked on that switched

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,960
everything over and said

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,039
now you could download um

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,399
wanna okay i'm gonna stop share okay and

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,240
we first want to show you another

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,520
few features this little tools on the

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,520
right side so

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,520
uh let me switch back to

00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,840
these slides while you do that i want to

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,600
mention that

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,360
for specific demos and things like that

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,640
there's a particularly useful feature

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,880
for that so

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,840
as you saw enabling screen share takes a

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,120
few seconds

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,960
but if you just want to share a

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,840
screenshot you can just capture that

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,919
uploading a single file image as a

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,320
presentation material is a great way of

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,799
of

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,240
getting people a screenshot of a

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,960
terminal or showing them

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,640
an existing slide somewhere else so you

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,679
can make use of that if if you're

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
looking at a

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,039
snippet of code and you don't want to

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,240
just drop it in the share

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,039
you need to be slightly better

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,159
represented sharing screenshots

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,440
pictures images single files uh works

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,840
very well there

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,720
and and they'll be rendered properly uh

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,720
for you

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,440
steve so i got the whiteboard here now

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,440
what i'm going to do is

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,960
click on the tools see here this

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
tool chain here and i go and click on

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,440
pencil and now i can

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,240
draw i can click here

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,240
make a box

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,919
um circle

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,679
and all fun stuff right text

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,960
draw the box for the text it's not like

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,720
most places where you just click you

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,919
actually have to draw the box

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,799
correct right

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,960
so and then you know i could re undo

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,360
certain things delete everything

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
and i'll talk about this last box in a

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,799
little bit

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,760
when i switch over to some to you guys

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,120
um

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,880
i think and then one more thing i want

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,919
to show you is this share external video

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,240
uh this i'll actually give a demo

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,159
for it in a little bit but i'll do it on

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,120
ours but this year if you

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,679
say if you want to show a demo sometimes

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,600
since

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,760
sharing doing what i'm doing sharing my

00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,360
screen is actually a lot of

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,840
cpu power i believe it's on the servers

00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,159
and on my laptop and everything else

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,000
so it's better if so if you want demo

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,880
it's best that people just record it

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,640
uh and upload it to youtube if you

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,559
upload a video any of like a little demo

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,279
on youtube you just put in that url here

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,360
and then it

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,559
streams writes everyone else in it makes

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,519
the servers

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,760
much happier on our end so that's highly

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,919
recommended i'll talk about that too

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,039
um and that's why i also want to go in

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,000
here and start talking about what

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,960
happens if you have

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,799
problem things so uh well gee you're you

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,120
didn't come on as muted so you came on

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,159
so let me switch over back to us

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,159
and go talk a little bit yes i want to

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,799
make my appointment

00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,600
so see that up here where i saw ghee's

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,960
name

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,880
i just went up and clicked on it and

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,640
that mutes if i click on me i'll mute

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,600
myself if you click on me you'll mute me

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,080
so please don't

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,000
uh i was making a very important point

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,440
and then you interrupted me but my point

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,120
is more important than your point and

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,880
this is where

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,200
yes so i can sit there and click so um

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
also

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,440
so yes so if you go here

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:10,879
and if i go back and say if i don't like

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,800
this person if i click here i could also

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,879
um they didn't come in that's right they

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,200
didn't oh they're muted anyway so

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,159
i can't you can't unmute them so i

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,639
wonder if i could

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,639
one second i'll go in here unmute myself

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:32,240
and just just mute the person um

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,919
so i click on this guy too

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,280
and there's this turn off meeting mute

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:41,119
i like to do that right because there's

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,720
so i turn off medium you cause i guess

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,200
that's that's what happens when everyone

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,079
comes in muted

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,119
and i can make all users muted i can

00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,079
make all users

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,720
except the presenter muted uh the lock

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,560
viewers

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,480
is like say if you just don't want

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,599
anyone's webcam on i could turn off the

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,200
webcams there's other

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,040
things here i don't know all the details

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,359
i know gee you know a lot more

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
um about the webcams you can make the

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,000
point that

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,240
this is the only mean we have for

00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,359
stopping photo bombing by users

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,560
so there is no way for you to mute a

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,440
single user camera

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,960
just the way uh somebody muted steve or

00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,480
myself a little bit ago

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,079
it's a limitation of the platform if

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,200
somebody is being disrespectful

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,160
or is abusing their webcam um the only

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,760
recourse you have

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,400
are one to disable webcam sharing for

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,400
everyone

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,240
the way steve just showed you by going

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,640
to the settings in the users list and

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,720
the

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,240
log viewers and then removing webcam

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,320
support or

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,119
removing the abusing user altogether and

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,280
that's gonna be shown now

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:48,000
right there so i'll i'll kick you out

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,480
okay so hit remove user now it says i

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,839
have a

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,560
i could say prevent this user from

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,440
rejoining so don't do that first

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,520
ideally but if you just say yes bye bye

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,240
guy

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,520
he could come back now but if you could

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,200
click on do not

00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,200
let him in he will not come he will not

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,160
be able to come in until the very end of

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,240
the session

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,440
so or until the session is over where

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,880
you go and uh

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,119
close everything which you should not be

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,040
doing by the way

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,480
uh i mean what i'm saying is if i go

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,119
click on options here

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,480
uh end meeting and log out have two

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,320
different meetings

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,240
and decided we're gonna we're gonna

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,960
remove the animating feature oh we're

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,640
gonna start out okay yes because when

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,320
you end meeting you actually end

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,680
the meeting and every recording and

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,800
everything else so if someone wants to

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,599
extend it or if there's something coming

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,280
on behind you

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,960
we have to set up everything back up

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,079
against so uh

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,680
we're getting rid of that so i don't

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,640
need to really talk about it so log out

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
but that's

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,920
but i believe that's if you kick someone

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,320
out for good that means that they can't

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,160
they're

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,680
out for good until because i believe

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,320
that means they can't come in until the

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,880
meeting's over

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,520
isn't that correct that's correct right

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,680
so

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,440
so don't kicks don't say do not rejoin

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,359
in unless

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,280
if you have to do that because someone's

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,040
really being obnoxious

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,440
that's when you when that's when the

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,920
code of conduct has to be

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,359
applied and we do have we have links or

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,440
we have information in the

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,400
the document i believe right gee about

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,839
where to go

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,880
uh we i believe we have abuse or

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,599
something on on rocket chat

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,480
so report that right up what happened

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,000
why this person

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,000
we will go and deal with this because

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,079
we're having a very strict

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,680
policy that uh if someone's being

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,359
abusive we don't want them here like you

00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,200
said we have 900

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,520
attendees we want this to go as smooth

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,440
as possible and with 900 there's a

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,520
chance that there might not be some nice

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,320
people that come in i i'm sure everyone

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,119
is awesome

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,320
but if there's 900 people um i'm still

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,240
looking at my camera down here

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,280
if there's 900 people there's probably

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,560
bound to be someone that might be

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,480
abusive so we

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,599
will kick them out um so i think that's

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,400
oh let me go on that note and oh and

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,720
that's like i said

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,560
but i think i showed you yeah all that

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,640
so on that note let me uh stop sharing

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,160
it's not this screen

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,440
and i want to go back to the whiteboard

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,520
and show another thing

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,480
uh well there's not a way for you hey

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,920
you got the oh you wanted to do the poll

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,920
so if i want to do a poll here

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:18,079
there this is where you if you have a

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,800
slide with something information

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,800
and you want to pull

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,520
again i could see everyone what you're

00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,520
doing so

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,839
and in the meantime i'm going to have

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,880
some fun

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,760
i just gave everyone access to draw

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,640
on the slide that was that little

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,240
squiggly thing

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,079
at the bottom that i told you that i

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,920
said i'm going to talk about later on

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:47,200
of all the tools there's that little box

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,520
with other squiggly

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,240
so now everyone has the ability to draw

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,520
and play

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,119
i could make things go away too and

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,280
i could clear every once i believe right

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,720
whoops no i could stop it

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,480
i'd stop it then clear it so um

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,560
that was just to give you an idea to

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,160
play ah

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,280
where's the i don't know

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,560
um let's see that was that part that i

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,079
wanted to show

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,560
post results thank you um

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,599
let's see there's the white board that i

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,520
wanted

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,040
and i'm sure i forgot something else

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,920
okay what else was there supposed to be

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,079
anything else

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,040
to bring up oh you covered a lot of

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
ground i think

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,079
maybe mentioning the shared notes on the

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,240
side the fact that those are

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,760
for e for pad based maybe share your

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,040
screen for that again or people can

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,640
explore on their own

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,839
the importance of downloading their

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,599
files if there is important

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,119
conversations in the chat and things

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,960
like that i think those could be useful

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,000
as well

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,680
so i'll go back here everyone gets so

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,640
let me just so i don't have a thousand

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,680
things here is there a way to

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,520
i don't know my face really big um but

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,200
here you have the public chat

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,560
everyone's saying the shared notes which

00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,240
i believe was that kind of ether

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,119
that's ether pad backed e5 yes yes

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,160
um import and export right if we want to

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,440
we'll probably say this

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,359
oh yeah that's another thing i do want

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,440
to cover is about the

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,280
micro conferences again we're going we

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,480
plan on having some sort of write-up

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
i'm not sure if we're going to have any

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,359
talk about like at the end where

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
everyone presents something

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,440
but please take notes of your micro

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,359
conference uh as you go in

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,960
write up stuff in the shared notes if

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,520
you have an external thing

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,480
record it we'll try to download and save

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,079
everyone's notes

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,680
and then i'm going to expect everyone to

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,359
have like a summary or write up about

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,400
this and we'll probably post a blog like

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,520
we did last year

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,640
if you noticed inside if you go to 2019

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,480
all the microcompanies go

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,760
to the accepted microconference links

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,839
and look at all the microconferences

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,079
there's also a section that says summary

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,000
so we want a summary of all that was

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,720
accomplished

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,160
one thing that makes plumbers uh stand

00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,520
out among

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,000
basically all the other conferences we

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,839
asked me is the fact that it's extremely

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,040
um focused on being productive

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,119
we are this is kind of a work conference

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,480
and to get people to have all these

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,359
wonderful sponsors to continue

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,359
sponsoring us

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,800
and get people to sponsor come when we

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,640
go back to being live events

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
and we have companies sending their

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,040
employees to come here

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,760
we want them to know that uh it's a good

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,319
investment

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,960
so when we have uh summaries about how

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,560
things got

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,640
how well things were done on at the

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,920
microconferences that helps the managers

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,280
will be reading this and saying wow

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,079
there's a lot of work that gets done

00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,359
here it's not

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,200
just a free-for-all or whatever like

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,440
that so people go there to get things

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,359
done and that's what we love about

00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,640
plumbers i i actually i'm really excited

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,760
about every year for

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,240
plumbers comes it's my favorite

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,760
conference because i get to talk

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,160
technical there's really there's no

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,200
marketing involved it's just coming down

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,760
and and learn a lot and hear how

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,119
discussions are made how does how why

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,480
technical decisions were made

00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,400
i think that's really exciting it's

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,720
unique among plumbers and that

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,720
and it takes the work from moderators

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,119
and the microconference runners

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,000
to achieve that so it's it's a bit of

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,079
work and

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
i understand that i i've been a

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,760
microconference runner several times too

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
um and i appreciate the work that

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,440
everyone does and the more people

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,400
put into that the better it is overall

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,200
and the longer that

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,720
our productivity lasts for plumbers so i

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,960
just wanted to say that

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,920
um let's see so

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,920
as i ended that

00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,560
anything else is that i don't know if

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,640
there's so it's on the slides here

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,319
oh yes the we are on break this is what

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,880
i wanted to uh state

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,680
so when you're doing the 15 minute

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
breaks we

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,960
are going to have this on here although

00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,040
i noticed that we don't have

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,079
uh there's going to be two slides i

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,839
believe right gee one without this

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,079
line below it's just going to say we are

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,880
on break and then we have a slider right

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,720
after that

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,640
that you'll go to that has this line

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,079
below and then what i'm going what you

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,880
could do is you go in

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,000
and let me share my screen just so so

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,240
you have read that email

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
fred

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,800
okay i probably write in five there's

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,440
certain things that i'm like yeah yeah

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,200
yeah

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,839
so if you go in here and i'm sharing it

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,640
but

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:17,760
um ah that's not what i wanted

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,200
thing start pull

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,240
custom pull i'm just going to type

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,960
ready custom pull and now when you come

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,280
back

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,400
after the 50 minute break is over you

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,240
send out the ready

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,599
custom poll to everyone and then you

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,319
just wait for people and then you kind

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,079
of ping people

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,839
they say elena are you here are you at

00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,839
your desk are you not watching are you

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:41,680
listening john are you lena

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,440
um so um try to make sure this is a way

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,960
you could see who's here and who's ready

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,079
so you know someone's at the screen

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
because like you said we're keeping my

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,640
we're keeping

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,240
the video off and we and you won't know

00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,960
who's here who's not so this is a good

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,640
way to get a good idea of

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,119
everyone here then when you start you

00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,119
get to see

00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,359
how many people are ready

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,880
okay and oops you accidentally

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,280
demonstrated that when the presenter

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,319
zooms inside the presentation area this

00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,680
actually affects

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,599
all the viewers so if you want to

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,720
emphasize something on the slide you can

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,119
use that feature for that

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,079
yes okay so actually i think what

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,760
happened was

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,440
i modified i moved things i already

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,480
locked in i think what happened was i

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,079
shared the screen and i

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,000
adjusted it as i was coming back so i

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,119
think it screwed up the size i don't

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,960
think i accidentally zoomed in i think

00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,760
because i resized the screen as i was

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,400
coming back

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,200
and i think possible if you used your

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,599
your screen

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,680
your scroll mouse wheel that will affect

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,920
it as well you can control the slides

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,119
using your keyboard shortcuts so

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,520
left right arrow up down uh page up page

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,599
down

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,240
if you are focused on the presentation

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,280
area will change the slides for you

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,800
oh hey i've learned something see i'm

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,319
glad i came to this

00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,920
um let's see so

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,160
uh let's see how to handle questions

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,359
uh yeah for questions like i said look

00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
we should probably always have someone

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,119
looking at the public chat and

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,760
everything so

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,960
if someone's some people maybe kind of

00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,000
listen only mode they might just want to

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,520
say something so it's always good to

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,400
have someone looking at the public chat

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,240
or having

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,599
the public chat and someone a question

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,200
comes up uh

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,040
and you have your microphone on and you

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,160
could see you could tell if someone

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,160
says something and you can see that

00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,079
their microphone's not on like

00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,520
maybe just turn on your webcam say hey

00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,560
uh there's a you know question here

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,760
that's good let's

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,720
no and repeat it out loud so people see

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,520
then like i said everything's being

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,119
recorded

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,560
um that's another thing everything's

00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,200
basically being recorded

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,560
so uh even the boss and everything like

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,359
that because

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,720
uh it's a virtual conference uh and you

00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,680
just gotta expect to be recorded and

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,040
there's certain things

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,800
technical wise here and we're not

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,599
recording uh big blue button

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,280
is recording so instead of giving anyone

00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,720
false security thinking that they could

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,160
say something that

00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,520
you know that they wouldn't say if they

00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
knew it was being recorded we just tell

00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,800
everyone

00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,599
everything's being recorded so beware

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,520
when you speak

00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,000
you are being recorded so let everyone

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,599
know that um

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,040
there was something made a good point

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,040
about the fact that

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,800
on the slide it states that there are a

00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,599
lot of places where questions can come

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,160
from so

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,800
as your microconference lead just set

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,400
the tone

00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,839
tell them where you want the questions

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,560
to come in if you really want to

00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,280
encourage

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,040
vocal and visual participation tell

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,520
people to help their their questions

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,359
live

00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,200
on the on the chat if you don't want to

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:31,520
collect them in a shared notes

00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
the way gnome did it tell them do you

00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,119
prefer public chat or if you want to

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,760
keep all of the text-based communication

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,520
inside of rocket chat and only focus on

00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,520
video and the slides here do that

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,560
it's it's really up to you those are

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,319
various means

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,640
by which people can communicate with the

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:50,000
presenter and the mc leads

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,240
i suggest that you make your choice and

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,720
you state that clearly and early in your

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,720
session so that people

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,760
commonly use that as the primary source

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,880
for interacting and asking questions

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,280
i have a question so is the rocket chat

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,119
stuff logged and recorded

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,560
as well and available after the

00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,640
conference

00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,160
that is an excellent question i do not

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,960
know the answer to your question

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,800
i will investigate i am certain given

00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,960
everything is stored in the database

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,200
that everything can be retrieved

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,319
however now there is a simple easy way

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,240
to export that

00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:25,680
i haven't investigated but i am

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,079
convinced we can

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,480
also it's a good segue to say that we

00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:32,480
have support from the rocket chat team

00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,000
uh the guys behind the project and the

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,240
company are helping us

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,280
and if we need any of their support for

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,160
that they will be

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,160
glad to help us

00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:53,839
so question um

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,839
everyone here knows what rocketjet is

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,119
maybe you can share your screen and show

00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,480
yours if you're logged in now or you're

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,599
still not

00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,559
you are i am logged in just let me make

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:08,160
sure i

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,160
go to the general site before i do that

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,720
okay so rocketchat is basically a open

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:20,960
source version of

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:23,599
slack so let me share my screen

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,599
and

00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,319
i'm in the general well since i'll go to

00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,680
moderators

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:38,319
and it's in if you go to chat

00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,880
2020 linux plumbersconf.org just click

00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,640
there

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,280
it requires the same credentials that

00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:49,839
you logged in for the meet at 2020

00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,839
and then you could say

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,599
oh and this is

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,839
it's basically again it's just like

00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,319
slack but again it's a web interface

00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,680
everyone should be able to get an

00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,000
account if you if you're logged here

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,920
you'll

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,200
get an account uh i believe that all the

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,400
chat we're gonna have channels for each

00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,839
microconference

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,440
uh they're already created yes yep so

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,839
in fact if you saw in there i'm already

00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,680
set up to be in containers real time

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,640
scheduler and android or something

00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,440
i selected some that i plan on going to

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,119
attend

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:25,280
um so please join uh

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,160
all these options for for you to get and

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,480
try to mingle

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,160
there's one of the sad parts about being

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,200
a virtual conference is

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,240
the lack of hallway track but hopefully

00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,559
with having like rocket chat and

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,319
the public forums and these forums and

00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,440
hack rooms and buffs

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:47,200
we could try to kind of get

00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,760
a little bit more uh interaction that

00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,359
would help offset what we lose with the

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,359
hallway tracks so

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:56,880
be involved talk to people and

00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,480
i don't know is there i think we're

00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,400
coming close to the end

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,400
is there anything else well i wanted to

00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,559
mention the slides again

00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,240
i put it on the chat but just to make

00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,480
sure that the

00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,240
contributions to the micro conferences

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,960
if there are slides they are also

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,559
uploaded in

00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,480
indico in the in the website so they're

00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,040
there for people that want to look at it

there at the time if

00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,599

we expect all slides to be uploaded to

go back and upload your slides on the

00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,480
website yes they did they gave it to you

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,640
or maybe if you want to do it for

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,240
everyone if it's up to you but you tell

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,240
them please give me the slides and

00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,520
also upload it to indigo the normal

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,920
where they submitted their

00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:15,200
uh abstracts and problem statements um

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,640
even like i said yeah okay i just want

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,119
to say even though i said that

00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,160
like microconference um i actually want

00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,359
to talk about slides

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,359
a little bit i don't think i forgot to

00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,200
mention this about when i talked about

00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,559
micro conferences

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,119
i found that slides really do help

00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,760
discussions um some people really

00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,880
associate

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,960
think slides means presentation

00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,000
i used to think that too until i went to

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,920
microconferences that

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,319
and i saw two different micro

00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,280
conferences one where all the topics had

00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:45,119
a lot of slides

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,520
and one where they basically said no

00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,280
slides or at least just one slide

00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,040
and i found out that the ones with a lot

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,160
of slides had a lot more discussion a

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,079
lot more

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,839
involvement from a larger group of

00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,040
people and that's because what they did

00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,920
was the slide said

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,720
here's our problem it described what

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,119
they're facing

00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,640
it described possible solutions it

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,200
describes like we were thinking of doing

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,359
this but

00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,800
here's the pros here's the cons and all

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,640
that was all that was all demonstrating

00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,800
slides 15 slides

00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,079
so they spent five seven minutes five to

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,720
seven minutes

00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,680
of a 15-minute period basically

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,160
presenting

00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,040
what the problem is and then the second

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,960
half

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,160
was a huge environment everyone was on

00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,880
the same page everyone knew what was

00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,960
going on and they

00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,160
had a lot of good discussions and then i

00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,480
went to the microconference that they

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,480
said no slides we only want discussions

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,680
and when they got someone got up and

00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,559
explained it

00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,599
two people in the audience of 100 people

00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,160
were involved

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,359
and everyone else had no idea what they

00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:44,079
were talking about

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,680
so when people talk about slides or you

00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,640
know no presentation that doesn't mean

00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,440
no slides

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,400
slides should be there to help encourage

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,480
the discussion

00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,680
and those slides are also good to upload

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,760
as well so people could say

00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,000
what was talked about oh this was the

00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,680
problem so even if someone came

00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,040
uh that wasn't there they're going to

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,640
watch the video they could see the

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,440
slides and say okay i see what's being

00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,920
discussed here

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,480
yeah i want to go back and watch what

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,640
what

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,079
solutions were so slides are not bad and

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,440
please upload them

00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,359
yes anything else yeah i had a comment

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,400
about the shared notes

00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:19,359
same thing save them export them keep a

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,720
copy

00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:24,000
uh and then those will be uploaded also

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,079
to indico

00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,599
uh you can send it to us we can do it

00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,119
you can do it but we

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,800
want to make sure they're saved as well

00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,640
yeah so when you're done with the

00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,760
conversation as i'm going to share my

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,880
screen one more time

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,880
up here if you see the caption save

00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:45,440
the comment the chat um shared notes

00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,559
uh it's this double thing you can export

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,079
as html

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,599
plain text i don't know are we

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,720
suggesting them something

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,720
to export it as

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,760
i think either pdf or html or text i

00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:01,440
mean

00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:04,480
yeah something that's easily incredible

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,079
yeah we don't have a strong preference

00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,079
okay so i mean this was actually

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:11,440
i felt like i was able to talk a lot but

00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,880
this seemed to be very much more a

00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,599
presentation than

00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,880
um discussion although we are trying to

00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,119
present something here this is more

00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,000
more like a referee track but please

00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,119
questions

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,839
um anyone have anything everyone fine

00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,839
everyone good

00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,359
yes no i i have a comment

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,799
this is for ghee the polling

00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:49,839
uh in the youtube shows

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,680
um there is some weird

00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,880
thing there we can discuss later but i

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,319
saw it was

00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:59,119
actually it was steve's fault i just

00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:59,760
okay i was trying to figure out what the

00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,359
i think

00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,599
i figured it couldn't possibly be my

00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,960
hack right it couldn't possibly be

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:06,960
though it's uh i think i know what

00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,440
happened uh i can't really do anything

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,280
about that

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,799
but yeah just you see i published the

00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,839
results for the previous poll you had

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,760
made so

00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:17,599
the polls are maintained you just you

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,599
just need to know how to retrieve them

00:55:18,839 --> 00:55:21,839
again

00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,079
all right um there must be other

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,599
questions or at this point since we're

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,760
just a few minutes before the end

00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,200
um if i can invite everyone that's so

00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,000
inclined and willing to turn on their

00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,839
webcams now

00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,200
i just want to see what kind of loads we

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,599
create on the machines and

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,680
exactly we have three minutes left i'd

00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,920
love to see your pretty faces

00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,319
time is up yes or the only thing that

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,160
stands between either coffee or beer and

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,920
and dave that's not a good place to be

00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,599
you're asleep

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,040
oh it's me lovely afternoon no it's

00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,000
remember it's three hours behind hello

00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,960
everyone

00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,960
uh wonderful

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,280
nice it's working um no more questions i

00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,920
mean you

00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,960
shout out david why doesn't that youtube

00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,599
guy respond to the polls

00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,880
yes i i didn't think about that until

00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:12,799
just now we've done three of those

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,040
sessions and i've played with it a lot i

00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,960
it's not one thing i thought to hide if

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,319
you look at the rest of it the ui the

00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,520
controls at the bottom of your screen

00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,119
and the controls at the top

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,559
i removed all of that and removed the

00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,520
chat because it takes too much screen

00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,440
real estate

00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,280
um the way they do pulling is a bit

00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,200
tricky but i will find a way to hide it

00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,200
as well so we will we'll get rid of that

00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,640
the other thing that is annoying me is

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,720
you can see the controls for like

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,240
minimizing or full screens on the

00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,680
youtube screen as well which

00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,920
turns out those are a little tricky to

00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,640
hide as well but i'll get to it if i

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:47,680
don't if i give up on sleep entirely

00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,680
it's great to see everyone

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,359
um no question really was it was he that

00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,880
clear

00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,640
we're talking about steve here right

00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,559
this is

00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,319
this is impressive well done i mean this

00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,000
is the fourth one he's doing and

00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,680
i have to concur that he's done a

00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,920
stellar job this time around so

00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,839

00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,520
a lot of people are gonna experiment on

00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:35,040
their own

00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,119
independently after going through this

00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,760
presentation and ask questions later i

00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,240
suppose

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,880
the uh there's already been quite a bit

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:46,400
of peer support so in the moderators

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,240

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,960
play around

00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,720
in the hack rooms they're there they're

00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,359
meant to be played with

00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,040
um we may still thrash the system a bit

00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,079
between now and monday so if things go

00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:26,160
down don't be surprised

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,160
but otherwise go in and play

00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,000
yeah i wouldn't stop that at monday

00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:33,200
things might

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,760
be off but yes awesome

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:39,280
well thanks everybody steve back to you

00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,880
well okay well actually i have nothing

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,920
left i just want to thank everyone

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,680
and again just feel free free to play

00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,280
the system i hope this is

00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,640
helpful i think we had a lot of people

00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,079
and yeah this is i mean this is my

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,480
fourth time so

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,280
um to do i think this was probably my

00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,040
smoothest

00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,040
of the talking the first one uh i told i

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,160
started off telling everyone uh this is

00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,680
the first time we have no idea where

00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,440
joanne expect a disaster

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,280
it really wasn't a disaster but it was

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,640
great i really liked the first one and

00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,920
and i think that's the one where we had

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,680
the most questions it's all the one

00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,119
where we had the most people so

00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,400
they were feeding on each other and they

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,760
asked a lot of really interesting

00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,359
questions that were all

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,760
included in the moderator's guide or

00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:19,599
that were mentioned here by steve

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,599
as a follow-up so you're benefiting from

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,040
the questions of the first three groups

00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,720
i think that might be also a reason why

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,720
we have less questions now is because

00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,640
we know what to expect so i think i've

00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,280
added things that were asked

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,079
from the previous uh three sessions so

00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,559
well thank you everyone

00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,079
i'll let everyone go back um and i'll

00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,400
see i'm excited to see everyone on

00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,400

00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:47,839

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,000
