people here but nevertheless i think

00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,319
it's about time to get started

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,279
again i'll repeat uh really appreciate

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,160
the support we've gotten from our

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,480
sponsors

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,320
uh this has been an interesting year uh

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,840
they signed contracts expecting

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
a face-to-face conference and they

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,960
aren't getting that but

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,560
they've stood beside us anyway and we

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,279
really appreciate that and some of them

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,119
of course are

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:26,480

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,520
big thank you to all of them

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,640
um this is uh often treated as kind of

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
boilerplate and i

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
especially this year recommend you take

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,600
every take it seriously

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,079
it's just way easier to

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,000
say um feel considered things

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,520
and have ill-considered things going on

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
uh when you're virtual

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,640
uh there are things that uh there's

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,159
there's things about people that make it

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,759
make them a little bit more inhibited on

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,719
this front of their face to face so

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,360
please

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,159
i'm sorry to have to say this at all but

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,159
it's 20 20.

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,039
and uh but then here we are and uh

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
please take this very seriously we want

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,120
everybody to have a good conference no

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
matter what

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,720
uh background or or type they might be

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,720
of

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,520
okay um

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,640
housekeeping so uh thank you for joining

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
we appreciate uh

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,879
uh one of my fears of course is that

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,519
we'll show up next week and something

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,680
will break

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
or somebody will show up and they will

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
and they'll do what i would normally do

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
which is not to prepare

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,920
then everything won't work for them so i

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,000
appreciate you getting ahead of the game

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,360
showing up for this and making sure that

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,560
things work

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,840
um so the way we work this there's a

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,840
couple reasons

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,879
is that if you're presenting or if you

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,920
have a question

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,959
and there's a couple ways of questioning

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
let's start with sending then you want

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
to have your video on you want to have

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,519
your microphone

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
on so that people can hear you and that

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,159
means you need to

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,080
be able to have those work for you

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,440
uh if you're not actively participating

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,879
uh we'd ask that you keep your

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
microphone and camera muted for two

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,760
reasons

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,959
uh microphone of course uh i'm sure you

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
guys have had the same virtual

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
experience most of us had this year

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
if you got somebody that doesn't realize

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
they're unmuted it can be really really

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
disruptive right and they may not be

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,159
paying attention so how do you tell

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,680
so please take extra caution next week

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,959
uh to make sure that when you're not

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
talking you're muted so you aren't

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,319
disturbing people

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,159
um i mean i've done that to people

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,280
before i have to take my headset off to

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,000
talk to somebody

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
and and i forget to mute and they're

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
hearing

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,080
stuff that that doesn't concern them and

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
i'm i'm causing trouble so let's let's

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
avoid that

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,040
uh camera um one way to say hey i want

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,239
to interact now is turn your camera on

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,360
okay but having too many cameras on has

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,640
two downsides one is it puts extra load

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
on our servers

00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,200
um we were thinking in terms

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,560
of when we selected this system of 550

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
people

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,959
um i think earlier this week we were two

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,840
people short of 900 signed up

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
okay and the video puts the heaviest

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,439
load on the servers

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
so to make it so that we can get through

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,639
next week without having the whole

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
system crash on us

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
uh please if you're not actually

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,320
actively uh

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
needing to have people see your video if

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
you're not presenting or you're not

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,840
preparing to ask a question

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
uh then please turn your camera off your

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
camera

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,199
of course make sure your camera works

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
ahead of time and that's part of the

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,520
purpose of this session and we'll we'll

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
go through that

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160
uh here in a moment uh we got few enough

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
people everybody could turn the camera

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,520
on and we'd be just fine

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,600
we've tested for far more than this so

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,800
how about everybody first uh turns your

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,040
camera on let's just make sure that

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,680
every camera works

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:56,080
so let's not be shy um i mean uh well

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,040
uh depending on exactly what

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,759
state of situation you're in use your

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,120
judgment

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,280
it's not to you please turn your camera

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,160
on let's make sure that

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,880
people's cameras actually work i'm

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
seeing

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,280
four other people there's a fifth one

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,479
showing up and uh we got a sixth one

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,160
that's great

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,520
but let's just you know let's see your

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
smiling faces all right

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
yeah we got a penguin there good shogi

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,400
uh

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,120
uh seven uh but uh the main thing

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,479
just wanna make sure that you know if if

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
somebody's got a problem with the camera

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,919
this is the time we want to debug

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
okay not next week all right that's what

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,240
we're getting for here

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,039
and what we'll do is uh we'll kind of go

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
through

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,840
have them say something just to make

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
sure that they're worse we've had

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,639
challenges in the past

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,919
on audio with people who have multiple

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,919
uh audio inputs and what will happen

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,120
it's uh it's usually best to use a

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,400
headset

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:56,080
the reason is that cuts down on

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,120
uh feedback okay obviously you're muted

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,240
feedback's not a problem but

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
and uh you have your speakers in the

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,360
wrong place they point at your

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,160
microphone and that

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,680
noise really quickly uh so if you have a

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
headset it's good to use it but

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,280
if you have a if you have a headset that

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
is not

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,720
directly connected to your system's

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,600
default

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
audio input uh some of some issues and

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
we got

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,319
more people showing up uh looks like

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,440
we've got most people here

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,039
that's great uh so it looks like uh um

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,840
so um if you are having a trouble with

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,680
your camera

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,280
i mean if you're choosing not to do your

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
camera fine um

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,840
okay i mean we got sessions later on and

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,280
you also have the option we got 15

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,199
minute breaks

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,039
and also 15 minutes at least preceding

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,520
the thing between all of the

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,160
referee track talks that's another time

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,440
you could come in although

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,840
there are cases where i won't be

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,840
available because i'm talking right so

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,120
i'm available now available later this

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
afternoon pacific time and tomorrow

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,759
morning so this is a great time to

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,280
be checking that okay um

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,199

okay we'll assume that everybody that

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,400
wants to make their video work has

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,280
again uh at any time if you're if you uh

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,240
uh are having problems with it uh

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,199
uh if you wanna hold if i can contribute

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,800
just very quickly

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,400
the presentation area is where the

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,919
slides are at the bottom of your screen

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,120
if you look there is a little

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
blue uh minus button in it if you click

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
on that it will minimize the

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
presentation area and maximize all the

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
webcams so

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,080
if the thumbnail is too small for you

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,400
right now you can click

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,319
on that little white uh blue and white

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
icon to maximize all the weapons and you

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,639
can see everybody's beautiful faces this

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
morning

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,080
including you know andrew being outside

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
louie's laughing at me

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,199
and if you want to resume that there is

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
going to be a little

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,800
presentation icon on the bottom right

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
corner now that you can click on to

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,680
restore the presentation area

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,919
as well uh final thing i love the cap on

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
the keyboard that's awesome

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,919
the final thing is you can actually move

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
the slider there is a resize area where

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,039
you can move the size between the

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
presentation area

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,000
and your slides so if you know your

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,680
slides very well but you want to make

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,519
sure you see somebody popping up

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,959
you can reduce the size of the slide so

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
you can make them bigger

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,159
we can show that again in the

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
presentation as well anybody can also

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,519
move it back and forth really quickly

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680
and make everybody grow and shrink

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
yes that's right why you'd want to do

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,000
that i'm not sure but here we are

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,040
okay at this point i guess i would it

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
would be good to

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,800
uh kind of go through and have people

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,920
say something to make sure that we're

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,480

youtube live we got a bunch of people

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,279
that

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
uh have tested this many many times on

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
the committee now let me just run back

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,600
down

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,600

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,880

i'll say raja takers me yeah raja

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,079
taklashmi

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,079
and you can tell me how it's really

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
pronounced

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,240
i think he's just disconnected you can

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,000
see there's no audio at all

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
his icon is white so it's neither in

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,360
listen only mode or

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,920
in the microphone mode it means it's

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,040
only connected without any audio at all

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,440
okay

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,800
so i can't hear you and elena was

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
mentioning that you might have skipped

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
over her so maybe we give elana a chance

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,279
to speak up

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,959
she was mentioning she had bandwidth

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,399
connectivity issues so

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,040
elena she's up at the top that's why i

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,079
skipped her

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,120
i'm sorry alana please no it's okay hi

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,600
hi hi everybody you hear me

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
very good thank you and again apologies

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
for uh

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,399
i just uh the the icons change shape and

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,519
i assumed that

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,120
your shape of icon implied uh that

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,519
you're part of the committee

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,399
uh when uh you're a speaker so you have

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,720
the same shape of icon

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,680
okay it might be a little bit confusing

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
for everybody here

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,000
what what paul mentioned is that there

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,320
are multiple roles here moderators

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
and participants viewers they have

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,399
different icons you see the people at

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,639
the top

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,240
all have square icons and underneath

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
that you have circles

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,480
the people that have square icons are

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
moderators on the platform they have

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,600
privileged access to help you

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,200
run your session um you do not need to

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,040
be a moderator to be a presenter

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
any one of you can be promoted to be the

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
presenter uh

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,839
and especially when you are the

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,680
presenter you don't want to be bothered

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,519
by the motivator activities so

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
your session mc the member of the

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
committee that will be in your room

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
or anybody else that has motivated

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,240
rights will help you run your session

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
you don't have to worry about that

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,320
the only thing i wanted to mention here

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,120
is when you log out or when you change

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,880
your settings

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
you're automatically demoted from

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,920
moderator to viewer

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,279
and that's why paul you missed her

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
because she probably was just logging

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,160
and coming back in

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
so her icon went from the top to the

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
bottom and back out so

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,320
don't be alarmed by that and again rely

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,000
extensively on your emc

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,680
or the moderators that are available in

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,199
your room to do all of the crowd

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,880
management and things like that so you

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,639
can just focus on your presentation

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,240
thank you gee i appreciate the

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,760
explanation and uh

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,760

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,760
video is enabled i can't see me

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,560
or anyone else but fair enough uh that

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,880
might be

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,600
let's see uh uh what uh

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,839
so what what what do you see on your

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,519
screen is just totally blank or what

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
totally blank unless i click on the

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,079
presentation in which case i get the

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,839
presentation

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,160
slide ah i'll i'll reach out to unique

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,420
we'll figure this out later

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,160
okay well at least we can see this or

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:19,519
[Laughter]

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,920
you're ringing a fedora hat right

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,800
did i get that right it's around yeah

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,160
this is my red hat hat actually

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,680
and oh he's got a fedora hat too okay

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,759
yeah yeah

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,920
we're always so happy to see you guys

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,040
all right

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,880
wonderful yeah yeah

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,050
it wouldn't be a conference without your

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,000
hat nick

00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:47,199
[Laughter]

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,040
all right um any questions on uh on any

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,519
of this

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,519
let's see

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,040
the uh uh and as he mentioned the mcs

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,399
will be moderators

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,560
uh and uh they will um

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,000
uh they will have the power although

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,160
they're free to call somebody else

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,959
such as myself in uh or anybody on the

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,959
pending end as well

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,480
and uh it is possible to silence people

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,360
uh if need be hopefully hopefully people

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,959
will pay attention to the code of

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,440
content and that won't be necessary but

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,839
yeah it's 20 20. what can you say

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,360
um okay patrick you mentioned that you

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
disabled your webcam displaying your

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,399
audio improved

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,600
uh that can happen sometimes there may

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
be a bandwidth bottleneck somewhere

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,920
along the line

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,199
and that's also one of the reasons why

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
normally i mean this is obviously the

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,680
exception and

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,639
and the server is just fine with this

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
number of people even if everybody

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,480
turned their video on we'd be

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,560
we'd have plenty of margin uh we've gone

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,040
up uh quite a bit higher

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,880
uh but uh

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,440
before upgrading on one of the one of

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,399
the uh better constant wins of the 2020s

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,040
i upgraded my

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,680
home wi-fi and before upgrading my home

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,839
wi-fi

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,720
i had a trade-off between audio and good

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,880
video

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
uh after the upgrade i'd find both ways

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
but

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
we're in different places the world we

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,360
have different bottlenecks in different

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,039
places and

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,039
some experimentation may be necessary

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,799
okay

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,000
uh if there's no more questions on that

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,079
if people are

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,120
uh good there with the possible

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,000
exception of video

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,600
uh in the other direction for nick uh

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,799
let's uh go ahead uh

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,880
call out to the planning committee

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,559
there's a few of us on here but this has

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,080
been an interesting year

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,600
and i appreciate my fellow committee

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,559
members willing to be flexible and

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,120
willing to deal with

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,360
uh with life as it came in this in this

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
year

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,720
okay um uh this this presentation may be

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
downloaded

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
and so i would encourage you especially

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
the mcs

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,919
to actually download this so you have it

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,000
locally in case something is

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,240
causing trouble and you can't find it

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
afterwards to download it if you look in

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
the

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
if you put the presentation up and look

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,280
in the lower

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,120
left hand corner of the presentation

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,799
there's a little a very small

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,799
download thingy it's the arrow with the

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,120
arrow pointing down to the flat bar

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,400
it's rather small at least in my screen

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
if you click on that you can download

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
the presentation

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,200
you get a pdf if i remember correctly

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,880
and that way you'll have access to all

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,960
these links at all times

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,240
and there are a number of things in

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
these on

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
uh that are help in case you're having

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,160
trouble connecting of course

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,480
reaching out to any of us on the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,200
committee is all fair game as well

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
and encouraged

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,840
the we also have

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,360
rocket chat i'm not sure if any of you

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,039
found that yet

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,720
if not what i'm going to do is i'm going

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,160
to going to paste

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
well i'm going to paste it anyway so

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,720
there how's that um

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,120
let's find rocket chat here and let's go

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,480
there come on oh you can make this work

00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,760
there we are

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,760
and now what i'm going to do is i'm

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,480
going to paste this

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,480
into the

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
cat over here

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
and uh this is a this is a an

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,320
alternative

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,760
we we also have chetney so why why do we

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
have two chats what's going on right

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,120
what the heck

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,880
well um you know redundancy could be a

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,200
good thing sometimes

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,240
and uh this is an alternative way to

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,480
communicate

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,280
in case you're just unable to connect to

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,440
bbb

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,640
or in case bbb has a problem or any

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,400
number of things

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
this is a way to an ultimate way to

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,600
communicate yeah normally you use

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,799
the the thing also the general

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,919
channel in rocket chat is just there all

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,480
the time

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,240
and in bbb the chats are associated with

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,760
a given session

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,320
and so instead of trying to find where

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,320
one of us is looking in bbb

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,400
and say oh there's paul i i'll ask in

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,480
this question if you just post

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
here somebody's gonna find it maybe me

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,559
maybe somebody else but it's a channel

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,000
we'll be looking at

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,960
so anybody having trouble getting at

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,960
rocket chat right now

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,360
we're seeing plenty of people logging in

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,200
so i think they're finding their way

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,159
i i'm going to add another link here

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,440
paul if you don't mind it's not

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
something we discussed but i think it

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
will be useful

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,240
i just created the speaker's lounge

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,840
inside of rocket chat so that if

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
we speaker specifically have a question

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,679
and they don't want to use the general

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
channel

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,000
just the same way that we have one for

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,320
the moderators i created just a

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,840
hashtag presenters channel that they

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,080
they're welcome to join in

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,159
and and participate in uh ask their

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,799
peers for help and we'll be trolling

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,880
there

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,320
for answering questions as well so

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,520
you're welcome to use the hashtag

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
general that's visible by

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,520
everybody but if you have something you

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,960
necessarily want the participants to see

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,720
because you think it's a dumb question

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,039
there are no dumb questions

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,000
uh don't mistake to use hash presenters

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,440
instead

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,440
it's open to anyone to join

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,559
okay and uh there we have it welcome to

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,320
those features secret lounge i see

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,799
uh please do check that out because

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,240
again um it's good to

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
for us to work through problems with you

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,600
now as opposed to

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,679
uh having some emergency that

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,000
interferes with your presentation or

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,600
your if you're an emcee your speaker's

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,240
presentation next week

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,080
we want to deal with problems now i will

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,320
wait for nick to join there and i will

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,120
provide him assistance there

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,559

what's your thought should i

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,880
should i add the rocket chat channels to

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,559
this presentation

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,000
oh any reason not to i don't think you

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,760
i don't think you should not i believe

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
it's a good idea it's the first line of

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,679
defense for the presenters so yeah

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,679

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,840
we did what many other conferences did

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,159
we stretched out from three days to five

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,440
days so it's monday to friday next week

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,840
our start time is 2pm utc and uh

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,240

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
uh 7 30 pm uh we had somebody from

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,960
israel that would be

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,400
uh five o'clock in the afternoon uh

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,799
central europe where we have a number of

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
people

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,280
is four o'clock p.m uh eastern time 10

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,080
and 7 o'clock for

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,760
people like myself on the west coast us

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
the presentations are 45 minutes that

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,640
includes questions

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,000
okay um the 15 minutes we want to keep

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
that because

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,159
uh we may have speakers that did just

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
fine today do just fine this afternoon

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
just fine tomorrow and something breaks

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,360
and we'd like to have that 15 minute

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,000
slot in order

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
to deal with that quickly at the time

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
when they show up

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,559
as opposed to having to fight uh with

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,200
the

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,480
session previously running over if your

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,679
session does run over that's a good

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,200
thing that's great

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,120
and we got buffs okay um and

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
off president and you can submit a boss

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,480
at any time including right at the end

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,600
of your

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,080
um talk

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,640
and uh we'll do our best to take care of

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,559
that

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,480
and of course at any time i mean just

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,320
like at the real plumbers

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,480
this is real too and a non-virtual

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,880
plumbers at a face-to-face plumbers

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,960
um you could just go to you know off to

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,400
a room or off to a pub or something and

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
continue your conversation

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,840
you got the same option here you know if

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,360
you guys have if there's

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,640
five of you that know you want to talk

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,080
and you don't want to be bothered by

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,760
other people running along

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
feel free to use the virtual confidence

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,480
in your choice and go with it i mean

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,279
won't be supported by us

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,240
but but you know that's another option

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,960
but again

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,600
we are doing boss throughout the whole

00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
conference

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,919
so feel free to use that mechanism as

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,520
well and feel free to email me if it's

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,440
not getting approved quickly enough

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,120
just in case i'm you know distracted or

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,279
something or having a senior moment that

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,200
happens at my age

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,320
uh okay so um so we've gone through some

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
of this stuff we went through the video

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,679
audio video already

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,279
uh we showed slides um

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,799
uh if you have if you're a speaker and

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,159
have your speaker slides ready

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,840
this would be an excellent time to

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,200
demonstrate up to just go through the

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,640
motions of uploading it so you've done

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,159
it once

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,559
if nobody does okay fine uh but um

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
if you do uh please let's take care of

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,240
that now anybody

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,120
uh and let's let's uh let's do ray's

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,840
hand

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,400
if i can remember how the heck to do

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:45,520

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,120
um you can do

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,559
it what you do is you click on your own

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,080
icon

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,640
and there'll be a set status uh

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,159
thing so you click on your icon it'll

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,480

there'll be set status you click on that

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,600
and then one of the things you can do

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,159
is the second thing on my list anyway is

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,159
erase and then

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,159
it says emoji status set to raise if you

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,159
look at my icon on the left now

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
you should see a little a little thing

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,440
on the upper

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,039
left of the icon and that's a raised

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,799
hand

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,480
okay so if uh so let's just have

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,679
everybody try that out to make sure that

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
uh we can get at it

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,679
and that that every browser is being

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,159
cooperative and all that good stuff

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,559
so please raise your hand again what you

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,080
do is you click on your own icon

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,240
it'll make a little pop-up one of the

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,000
options is set status

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
you go over to that and click on that

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
and then you've got a list of things

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
away and

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,840
raise hand just just do raise and that

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,840
should make it so that you

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,840
have your hand raised this is one of the

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,640
ways to get people's attention and ask

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,000
questions

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,840
the other one of course is to turn your

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
video on

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,960
but if we got if we're in a session with

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,200
a lot of people

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,799
uh raising hands a little bit easier on

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,799
the server than not turning your video

00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,240
on

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,880
if if you'd like paul i can i can

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,880
demonstrate the ui of uploading a slide

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,320
uh very quickly for everyone and then

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,960
they can check that for themselves on

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,159
the

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,880
so if you don't mind i will take

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,520
presenter away from you very quickly

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,440
you notice uh if you want to notice that

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,120
on the very top left of your user list

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,640
paul is one of the first users up there

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,480
and you can see on this upper left

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,880
corner this little computer screen that

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,200
shows

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,559
is the presenter these little vignettes

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,279
on top of the thumbnail

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,480
are illustrating uh what you have so i'm

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,880
going to take presenter

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,480
real quick so now it's moved to my user

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,520
and i'm going to go ahead and share

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,399
a screen for all of us to

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,960
see i want to try to pick the right one

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,960
i think this will do the trick

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,559
it takes a few seconds for the screen

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,559
sharing to activate so

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,080
i i suggest that you take a few seconds

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,840
to make sure that everybody gets there

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,120
usually it's anywhere between five to

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
ten seconds

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,559
for it to be provisioned to all of the

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
users and now you can see i am logged in

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,720
in

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,039
the other app room right next to us at

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,760
chrome number two i am a trainee

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,320
uh supposedly um i really should just be

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,240
that

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,520
um and i don't have any privileges so

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
this ui is gonna look very much like

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,360
what you have

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,520
i'm gonna go ahead and assign trini

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,799
the presenter privileges and as you can

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,320
see the the

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,320
slide controls have appeared

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,000
at the bottom of the screen here uh i

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,919
can jump

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
to another slide if i know my slide

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,960
number over here

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,039
as a presenter it might be useful for

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,559
you to know that keyboard controls work

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,279
so if your mouse and you've clicked

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,840
focus on the presentation area you can

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,159
use

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,000
top down left right page up page down to

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,080
move between your slides which can be

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,559
comfortable as a presenter

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,360
but we came here because i wanted to

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,120
show you

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,039
how to upload your slides at the bottom

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,840
of the screen here on the lower left

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,399
corner there is an

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,200
actions button and the actions button

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,000
allows me to

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,320
start a poll upload a presentation or

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,120
share

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,679
an external video so i'm obviously going

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,159
to use

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,200
upload a presentation right now so if i

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,279
click here

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,880
it will show a full screen ui for the

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,720
presenter i can drag and drop the

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
presentation here or just trigger the

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,240
file dialog

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,600
to upload a slide deck i will just go

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,520
pick one called

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,480
not that we'll just do the sessions lead

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,919
presentation to town hall whatever and

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,440
now i have three of them the default one

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,039
that was listed the one i've uploaded

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,039
that is flagged as current

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,480
and the upload one it's selected by

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,200
default by that little green

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,000
check mark next to the icon and right

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,919
now i have not

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,520
enabled presentation download i will

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,399
just do that so you can see that it's

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,799
available

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,399
once you click upload the file gets

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,080
transformed by the server

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,760
it takes a few seconds as it walks

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,679
through all of your files and you can

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,159
see that now the new presentation

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,880
has been uploaded on that screen so

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919

fun one there all right and so at this

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,880
point

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,159
i uh

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,440
uh get myself unconfused do you want me

and then we're back over here yeah uh so

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,679
i'm learning too

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,039
as you might have noticed he is quite

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,840
expert at this interface and i

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,600
appreciate his

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,360
help with all of it okay

00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,440
so um we're gonna go through some of

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,559
these things here

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,279
uh the public chat

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,600
there's also a shared notes and uh if

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,640
you

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,960
look on the upper uh there's messages

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
which is where people have been typing

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,799
so at the very top

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,159
so there's a little a little logo on the

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,720
very upper left

00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
under it there's messages in public chat

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,440
and

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,440
uh in public chat we've been typing back

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,320
and forth that's great

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,880
um and then there's also shared notes

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,120
and share notes um is probably more

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,919
likely used by the micro conferences

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,440
than the

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,399
than the uh kernel summit or the referee

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,320
track sessions

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,919
but it's a place where you can put stuff

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,320
you can write stuff take notes or

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,919
or give feedback or something like that

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,279
um

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,279
in addition uh

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:35,840
let's see here i'll

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,799
oops i'll try clicking the right button

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,440
if you click on somebody's icon you can

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:44,640
you can start a private chat as well

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,080
okay and uh that might be useful if you

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
want to have a side conversation with

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,480
somebody

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,000
for example somebody's presenting and

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,519
there's somebody with with similar

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
expertise in the room

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,880
and you want to ask them wait a minute

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,640
this thing he said what what's really

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,880
going on with it or how does that affect

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,240
my part of the of the software stack or

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,080
whatever okay

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,360
but you can uh well go ahead and try

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,919
that if you want you can pick a pick a

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,000
victim

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,240
you click on their icon and there's

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:15,840
start a private chat you click on that

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,840
and you can type

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,640
okay uh several pick me as a victim

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,880
that's uh

00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,240
uh unusual choice but i appreciate it at

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,240
my age i appreciate whatever i can get

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
here

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,000
finally got smart and and doing copy

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,000
paste here

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,240
okay uh anybody having trouble with that

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,600
anybody try sending

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,600
a private chat that wasn't able to

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,320
blank once

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,679
going twice

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,480
okay uh if you're yelling at your mute

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,120

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,080
private if you're private incredible

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,360
private chat sending me a private chat

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,159
isn't going to be very helpful as advice

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,519
i'm afraid

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,440
but there's public chat you send me an

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,559
email whatever we can uh we can work it

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,799
out

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,760
okay uh we're gonna look at a couple of

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,840
other things here

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,919
momentarily uh you saw we saw a demo of

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,840
screen sharing that's how ghee showed us

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,279
his view of the other hacker and show

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,320
those things going on there

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,240
and again that's the plus on the bottom

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:56,320
and uh there's a way of uh excuse me

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,320
sharing down there okay

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:06,240
um let's try a poll here let's see if i

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:08,559
can make that happen

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,559
um

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,800
because i'm doing the wrong thing here

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,800
there we are

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,280
so i'm looking at wrong place let's

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,560
start okay as i said i'm kind of into

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,599
this as well

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,079
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,079
do an abcd pole to match the slide

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,919
now that i finally found it like i said

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,159
i'm learning this too

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:31,679
um so we're going to click on that and

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,119
that should give you a pull

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,879
and you should be able to see a way to

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,839
respond

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,320
and people are responding we've got uh

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,599
they're cut

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,639
responding quickly enough that i'm

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,639
having a heartbeat up

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,200
and uh uh sorry there's uh

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
anyway we'll we'll uh we got a couple

00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,440
left i'll give you a couple more seconds

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,599
if you

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,960
want to respond to respond if you're

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,200
having trouble

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,000
uh finding how to respond uh speak up

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,440
and we'll

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,880
go through it while we're waiting for

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,359
people to do that poll

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,560
i'd like to offer uh a piece of

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,200
information that

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,839
the poll answers that people are

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,800
providing

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,599
are not anonymous meaning that the

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,920
presenter

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,599
sees the answer that each individual has

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
selected for themselves the final

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,920
results

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,920
is a count of the answers and therefore

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
anonymous the other viewers won't be

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,720
able to see what you selected

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
as an answer but the the presenter

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,720
himself

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,160
can see what each individual contributor

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,000
to the pool has selected

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,280
as an answer and of course if the

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
there were a couple people that clicked

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,839
a um if there's something we do to

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,839
improve it

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:46,720
feel free to tell me one way or another

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,560
your choice of communication media

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,119
if you were just uh yanking my chain

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,960
that's fine too you know

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,960
um okay so i published yeah

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,200
and there we are you shouldn't uh go

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,079
ahead gabe sorry i didn't mean to talk

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,160
over yet

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,119
i was going to ask you to click publish

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,960
results uh

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,480
to a very separate thing it's a very

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,240
selfish thing on my part if you don't

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,400
publish the results but you do a poll

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,520
your poll answers your poll question

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
answers will be stuck

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,599
on the live stream until you do another

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,599
poll so um just out of regard for

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,440
everybody that joins the live stream

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,040
um on top of the fact that they can't

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,640
answer the poll questions

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,160
they'll be stuck seeing the poll

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,280
questions until you actually publish

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,880
results so

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,800
unless we can patch that out i haven't

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,160
looked at it yet it'll be nice and also

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,440
you do a poll you should always

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,800
if you have the courage to put the

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,839
question out there you could show you

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,520
should show the answer

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,359
in order to do that in that ui there is

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,520
a button that says publish results

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,720
make sure you always click that before

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,720
you move on to your next slide

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,160
thank you

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,640
all right

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,400
so um now we can have fun with a

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,000
whiteboard

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,240
um and uh

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,119
what we can do here is uh you there

00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,320
should be a pallet on the very far

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,160
right hand corner of the screen um

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,160
and uh go ahead you can click on

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,760
different things and make shapes there

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
if you don't see a palette there speak

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,640
up so that we can

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,480
get the right thing in the right place

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,359
to enable that

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,960
they do not they do not as a presenter

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,400
initially you're the only user that has

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
access to the whiteboard so if for

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,640
example

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,160
right now paul is moving his mouse on

00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,000
the screen you can see that his cursor

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,640
is received presented by a red dot

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,440
this is our 3 000 miles capable laser

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
pointer

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,880
please don't look at it directly with

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,440
the remaining um

00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,920
you can draw shapes you can do text you

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,240
can do all sorts of stuff that way

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,760
as the presenter it's it's mostly useful

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,680
if you have a diagram on the screen and

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,800
you want to add something to that

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,160
um the very bottom icon on that

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,240
whiteboard toolbar

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,359
is a multi-user toolbar so if you click

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,599
on the very bottom

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,680
icon in your toolbox paul you will

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,040
enable shared whiteboard for everybody

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,720
else

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,320
okay everybody will be able to see the

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,960
toolbox and uh

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,839
access that please use that very

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,079
carefully

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,240
it's fun here i don't recommend you

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,320
actually do that in your presentation

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,160
um if you know the reason that it's very

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,160
taxing on the server uh

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,160
and everything else but um

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,000
as well uh you can stop that at any time

00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,440
uh paul uh the most useful thing is if

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,760
you look at the toolbox you can actually

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,760
shape but you can write text so that

00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,839
what that one could be useful so

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,119
if you click on the pencil there is a

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,599
text writing

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,880
you can draw a box in which you want to

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,000
add the text and you can

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,760
type text inside of that um

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,079
[Music]

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,680
you the annotations that are created by

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,320
the whiteboard tool remains with the

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
slide

00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,920
so if you move forward and you come back

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,839
the annotations will still be there

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,400
and you can clear the annotations when

00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,640
you're done with that um if you do a

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,320
poll and attritions at the same time

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,400
if you remove the annotations it will

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,720
clear out the call results as well so

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,480
i would suggest you don't do polls and

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,520
whiteboarding on the same slide if you

00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,599
can avoid it back to you paul

00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,119
okay thank you guy and uh yeah like i

00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,119
said i'm learning this too yeah there we

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,400
are oops clear

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,079
oops clears okay yeah

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,040
and uh so what i'm gonna do is i'm going

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,200
to uh

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,640
uh yeah if i hit if you hit the the

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,440
trash can it clears

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,000
eventually uh clears mine and it clears

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,160
yours

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,760
or i can just turn it off and then clear

00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,560
everything and it's gone

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,480
so it's a great way to do graffiti again

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,000
this does load the server a bit

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,680
uh if you have a large group and you

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,240
enable everybody um that

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,920
may uh be inconvenient for the other

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,839
people attending plumbers so please

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,240
you know keep it to a small group

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,880
setting

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,880
okay uh let me

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,880
uh get the next slide here okay

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,800
uh we've talked about this a little bit

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,119
but it bears reiterating again

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,720
you know this is easier in uh

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,920
face-to-face we know how to do it

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,440
you put your hand up and somebody throws

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,640
a microphone at you you grab it and

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,280
start talking

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,720
all right what we're going to do is you

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,040
can ask them in public chat people have

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,480
been doing that and that's great

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,240
there's a shared notes has anybody not

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,440
found the shared notes

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,359
right now that would be there's

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,359
messages with public chat and any

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:38,880
private chats you participated in

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
and then there's notes and shared notes

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,640
if you click on that you'll see

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,000
a few urls that have been uh

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,599
pre-populated there

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,359
and you can type

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,040
in there sort of like the ether pads

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:57,040
we've used in previous plumbers

00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,040
associated more directly with the dvd

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,160
um so you can uh it's a it's a shared

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,000
thing there

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,520
and then uh um

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,280
uh for microconferences there's a

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,720
dedicated channel for each of them

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,400
um i'm not sure we're gonna do that we

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,839
have we have speakers already

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,920
so we'll we'll uh do that uh yeah there

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,200
as well

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,200
and thanks keith for setting that up

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,599
okay

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,599
so at this point

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,280
if there are any questions or things

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,599
where uh wait a minute how do you do

00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,760
this

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,000
or how's how do we make this actually

00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,400
work this would be a great time to

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,920
let us know we still got a couple days

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,079

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,640
figure out how to how to make the world

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,640
work here

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,359
i have a question go for it um

00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,280
i'm victory about the uploading your

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,200
slides to bbb

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,200
because it talks about a plus button in

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,599
the bottom left of the session window

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,440
is that a vpd session or something else

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,880
because i don't see a little plus button

00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,119
in the bottom left

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,119
okay

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,440
here if you don't mind i'll take over

00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,720
presenter from you

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,640
uh and uh nathan it was you nathan right

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,000
yes it was thank you thank you and now

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,720
you should see a button on the lower

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,760
left corner

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,000
oh i do yeah oh well i've yes

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,880
oh right it appears when you're the

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
presenter but

00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,920
not otherwise is that why don't you take

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,280
us to

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,520
why don't you go through some of the

00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,160
slides here you can try moving them left

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,480
and right

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,839
you can uh you see we see your cursor

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,560
right there you can use your keyboard

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,800
and all the masks

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,920
that's the presenter's ui so most of the

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,760
screen remains the same

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,079
you just have that toolbar underneath

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,720
the slides now and you can navigate

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,079
and you have that toolbox that shows the

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,440
whiteboard on the right hand side that

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,359
you always have as well

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,440
and you can create a poll share an

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,720
external video or upload videos with

00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
that plus button right now

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,560
again okay you need to be presented to

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,760
see that

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,000
okay thank you that's what i was missing

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,000
great

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:19,680
okay and uh thank you guy uh

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:23,280
and uh thank you nathan for being our uh

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:27,119
demonstration okay

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,720
um other questions

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,280
luis uh yes sorry you mentioned that we

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,160
we can silence people in the room if

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,680
necessary

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:43,040
but i don't see anything here that would

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,040
let me do that to me the microphone

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,319
are no uh so you're you're not

00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,839
a moderator right now luis uh therefore

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,040
that is why you can't see that you see

00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,359
your icon as well

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,880
i will promote you as a moderator now

00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,760
your ui is going to have changed a

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,720
little bit what i'm

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,000
going to invite you to do is uh you you

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,280
can see at the top sorry i should

00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,400
probably to my camera also you guys can

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,160
see me as well

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,000
that would be considerate at the top of

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,520
your screen just above my icons

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,599
up here you can see bubbles that

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,280
illuminate if paul you talk as well you

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,200
can see that everybody else's

00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,800
icons are illuminating the brighter they

00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,520
are the more energy comes through the

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,119
microphone

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,880
and somebody wants to go and just mute

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,319
me right now by louise just click on my

00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,200
name and you'll be able to just

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,200
turn my microphone

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,520
much better yeah great

00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,240
this is only a one-time thing that user

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,240
can just unmute themselves so this is

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,520
where the crowd management part comes

00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,040
into play right you don't want the

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,000
speaker to be disrupted with that

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,640
commercial as an

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,480
emcee if you have the moderators we ask

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,560
you to be considerate of that and

00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,720
if somebody keeps interrupting more

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,319
likely there's a garbage truck outside

00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,760
and somebody forgot to meet themselves

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,560
and this background noise so you just

00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,560
want to

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,480
disable that or just some baby crying in

00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,160
the background this is all me by the way

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,000
and and all of that you want to be able

00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,760
to assist with that so

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,960
uh just do that on there yeah i'll just

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,319
let them know in a private chat or

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,200
whatever but they'll realize they're

00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,800
muted or you can

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,960
somebody else with them icon can let

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,520
them know um as the presenter

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,640
don't worry about this somebody else

00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,280
must do that

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,119
for you just focus on your presentation

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,920
on your material the things you want to

00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,520
share

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,119
and other people in your room will deal

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,640
with that so luis the answer to your

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,200
question is you're not a moderator you

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,119
are now

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,960
you can meet somebody this way there are

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,640
many other features for muting people

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,160
uh maybe paul if you don't mind i can

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,680
take presenter for a second i can show

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,200
that real quick on the other side so i'm

00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,200
going to share my screen again

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,560
i don't remember uh which one i was

00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,000
using

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,599
we're going to use that one whichever

00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,280
one this is and then again it's going to

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,200
take a second for the screen share to

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,560
activate itself again

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,400
i want to show you all the various

00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,880
places where you can do crowd management

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,359
as an

00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,119
as an mc because you weren't in the

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,720
session leads there is a video of that

00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,400
but here very quickly in case

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,960
of presenters are curious and something

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,040
is bothering them with that so

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,040
the trainee is not a moderator right now

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,960
so i will just promote him

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:12,240
uh very quickly um on the other side

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,599
which is on this side i must have 300

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,520
windows open so

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,359
bear with me for just a second okay now

00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,800
i have it so

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,720
over here i can um i can

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,000
contribute demo and do all these

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,680
activities on the users

00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,760
if somebody is very disruptive you can

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,440
go ahead and say remove user

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:31,440
so you can keep them out of the virtual

00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,760
room you can do it once or you can make

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
it

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,440
more permanent by taking the chest

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,359
checkbox don't worry too much about that

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,079
the only thing i wanted to choose here

00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,400
there's an ability to turn off a meeting

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,760
mute so you can disable all the people

00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,240
mute by default

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,240
or you can set the mute for everybody

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,680
but just the presenter i can't do that

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
right now because i need to set that up

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,680
here

00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,000
so you can see here there's this option

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,200
so as an mc or as the presenter that has

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,480
moderators privileges

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,760
if you'd like to do that you can turn

00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,839
that off and then you can send mute all

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,440
users except for the presenter

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,800
um and finally this is only the other

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,680
thing if somebody is actually logged in

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,280
with audio

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,440
here there is an option that says mute

00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,480
user as well this user is only in listen

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,319
only mode so i can't

00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,240
show you that directly there's plenty of

00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,880
places all that is documented in our

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,560
guides

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,680
hopefully there's enough keywords used

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,240
that if you just want to search for

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,839
things like

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,520
mute demod uh moderators uh camera

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,640
you should be able to navigate the

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:26,400
document that way but uh that's it luis

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:30,480
that's your mc

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,480
run through in three minutes flat

00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:39,839
perfect thank you thank you guy

00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,839
really appreciate that other questions

00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,520
let me go to the public chat somebody

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,520
pulls oh okay there we are

00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,839
all right um

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
uh you were breaking up pretty badly i

00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,839
heard

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,260
[Music]

00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
uh raja i'm having a really hard time

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,119
hearing you could you please

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,119
try uh the public chat and see how that

00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
works

00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,119
it was not just you paul i could i could

00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,839
not hear at all

00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,839
either

00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,319
and that might happen unfortunately yeah

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,400
no we're

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,440
we're trying to span many continents

00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,640
here and uh

00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,359
life can be heard

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,839
[Music]

00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,839
um okay so

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,400
for a brief second there was a

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,200
consideration for offering

00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,800
a landline phone audio bridge for the

00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,000
conference and then the complexity of

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,040
doing that very quickly

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,880
eliminate the idea so unfortunately

00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,359
all the audio as a presenter needs to be

00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,960
done through the internet and the webrtc

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,720
connection to our servers we don't have

00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,400
an alternative for you to present with

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,240
so

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,480
those data saving ideas being able to

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,240
turn off webcams not sharing your screen

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,440
just relying on the slides being served

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,000
up by the server

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,680
are always with which you can limit the

00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,520
bandwidth consumption so you can keep as

00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,839
much of your upload bandwidth for your

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,839
outgoing microphone audio to the server

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,119
there is a troubleshooting guide i think

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:54,720
those are available in the presenters

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,920
one as well

00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,480
and if if you need to run through that

00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,680
you can

00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,520
you can measure your bandwidth

00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,319
connectivity to the server the latency

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,599
you're facing

00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:08,000
you can test uh various webrtc uh

00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,920
systems the hack rooms is the most real

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
way to try that you can just jump into a

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,319
hype room and see what's going on there

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,680
but we'll be happy to help you um and

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,599
for everybody else here nick

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,040

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,119
through it yourself

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,920

you know otherwise we have our uh last

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,079
slide

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,599
uh well actually i don't have the last

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,720
slide because i'm not forgetting right

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,839
now but uh

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:09,839
if i let me do that and then

00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,599
that and we this already

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,040
uh and oh yeah i forgot about this i'm

00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:18,079
sorry

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:20,640
this just gives a uh a uh

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,119
rough idea of how our how we're set up

00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,520
what the

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,880
what this offer looks like and john

00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,319
corbett and g leonardi

00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,839
especially uh there have been other

00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,839
contributors as well not me so much i'm

00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,839
afraid

00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,760
who have put a huge amount of work into

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,119
making this happen this year we felt it

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,920
was extremely important

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,240
to make use of open source components i

00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,000
mean

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,359
i would obviously a lot less work to

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,720
have just you know

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,559
got one of the prefab things lay down

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,599
some money and be happy but uh

00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,280
but we felt you know we needed to to do

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,319
it this way to support

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:54,000
open the source software and that's what

00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,440
these guys did to make it happen and i

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,599
my hat's off to them

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,960
i i must admit that i was i had some

00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,920
skepticism early on when they said

00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,160
they're gonna do this

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,319
but they did it and that's great so

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,640
