hi everyone thanks for coming to this

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,040
first ever online version of linux

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,240
plumbers

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,920
when we first started talking about

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,440
moving online we were wondering if

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,080
anybody would actually be interested in

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,240
online

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,840
linux plumbers i'm pleased to say that

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,640
we've been blown away

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,320
by the response for participation we

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,840
sold out several times

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
and we have a great selection of talks

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,160
and microconferences for you

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,320
for those who don't know the story about

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,160
why exactly we're called plumbers

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,840
plumbers was chosen to describe the work

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,480
that needs to happen to tie

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,920
big separate things together this is

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,040
things like where hardware meets

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040
software

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,160
or kernel systems subsystems come

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,840
together or kernel and user space need

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,280
plumbing is usually invisible when it's

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,800
working but when it's not

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,160
you really notice plumbers has always

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,280
been about getting the community

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,760
together to solve

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
current problems this year one of those

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,079
problems included

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,640
what we were going to use for our

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
virtual platform as an open source

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
conference we really wanted

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,640
to stay true to our utes and use an open

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
source platform

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
and in a true open source fashion we

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
also turned to the community to help us

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,680
test

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,600
for the first time ever we ran two town

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,439
halls to give us an idea about how our

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,960
virtual platform would work

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,799
so thank you to everybody who showed up

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,920
to help make plumbers better and give us

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
a better idea about

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
how exactly this whole thing would work

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,280
we would also we also could not hold

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,960
plumbers without all of our sponsors

for providing a lot of work behind the

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,160
scenes uh to help support us in bringing

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,160
this conference together

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,560
while this is an online conference all

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,560
of our existing rules do apply

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
as they would at an in-person conference

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,280
and this includes our anti-harassment

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,959
policy

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,520
this policy covers everything that is

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,879
said in chat and on our virtual

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,879
conferences

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
this is something you take seriously as

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,840
you want this to be a positive

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
experience for everybody

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
if you would like to make a report you

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,720
can do so in the report abuse channel in

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,840
rocketchat

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
or you can email contact

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,000
linuxplumbersconf.org

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
both of these will go to the planning

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,599
committee if for some reason

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,360
you do not feel comfortable making a

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
report to the planning committee

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,280
please feel free to reach out to angela

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
brown vp of events at the linux

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,680
foundation

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,120
and absolutely none of this could happen

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
without the support of the entire

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
committee

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,200
as chair my job has really been to

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,959
support everybody else

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,400
in doing the work to bring this uh

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,800
conference together

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
building up a virtual platform even

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
based on open source project

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
is not an easy task and we would not be

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,800
here today without a lot of hard work

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,080
so if you see any of these people please

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
make sure you say thanks

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
and later give them a high five or offer

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
them a beverage

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,319
our online platform this year is called

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,159
big blue button

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,480
this is an open source platform that was

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,319
originally designed for academia but it

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
turns out this also works really well

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,000
for facilitating the type of discussions

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,440
that makes plumbers so unique

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
to get the best experience out of the

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
platform we're going to ask everybody to

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,000
keep your microphone and camera

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,239
off unless you're speaking you're

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,480
strongly encouraged to use your camera

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,239
and turn on your camera to do the

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,959
equivalent of raising your hand

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
so to give moderator moderators an idea

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,440
about who wants to speak and so you can

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,879
also do this

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,480
to get attention big blue button does

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,400
have a listen only mode

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
and you're encouraged to use that if you

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
don't actually

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
want to be talking or discussing because

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,840
it does reduce the

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,680
burden on clients but

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,439
and we and we know that even at

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,959
in-person conferences people may only

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,200
want to listen at times

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
but again plumbers is heavily discussion

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,400
based and interaction based

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,199
so you are strongly encouraged to

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,519
participate and ask questions

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,120
there's a note section in bigbluebutton

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,800
that is secretly just an ether pad

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
behind the scenes

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
you are encouraged to take notes

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,360
somewhere either in the ether pad or

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,880
somewhere else steve our micro

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,320
conference organizer will be reaching

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
out to all the microconference leads

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,680
afterwards to ask what was discussed

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,360
so you need to be taking notes somewhere

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,360
there's also a chat feature in big blue

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,520
button that is separate from our

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,120
our other rocket chat your feel free to

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,120
use both chats as you see fit

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,960
we do have a participant guide on our

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
website with more details

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,120
including troubleshooting tips for a big

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,240
blue button a common issue we've seen

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,160
with big blue button is

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
not picking up the right video camera

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,320
camera or audio device

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,199
if you have multiple available so if

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
you're having problems

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,560
please follow that guide or you can ask

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,160
them help desk channel

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,680
on rocket rocketchat we have a very full

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
schedule ahead of us

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
our in-person plumbers is usually three

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,400
days but because we're virtual we

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
decided to expand this

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,639
to five days and go a slightly shorter

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,000
time each days

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
the full schedule with detailed

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,479
breakdown of what the tracks are going

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,039
to be discussed

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,680
discussing is available on the website

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,759
we are

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
very happy to see many microconferences

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
coming back for

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,360
multiple years for even more discussions

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,960
and we're also excited to host

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
the application ecosystem micro

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,919
conference for the first time

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,360
we're also excited to have the gnu

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,280
tools track for the first time

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,479
one of the purposes of plumbers is to

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
bring developers from different

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,039
subsystems together to talk about

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
problems

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,360
uh that they both face and so to have

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,479
so many different uh people from low

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,080
level hardware

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,400
all the way up to printing is absolutely

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,759
amazing

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
all of our systems are scheduled to

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,280
start at the same time each day

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,280
at 2pm utc we do realize that this is

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,759
very early for some people and also very

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,039
late

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,759
so thank you for those who are

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,520
contributing outside of your usual hours

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,199
microconference runners are strongly

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,919
encouraged to stay

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,319
on schedule and end on time while we

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,000
know

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,440
we're not necessarily constrained about

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
things like coffee breaks

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,759
or lunch sitting in front of a screen

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
for hours and then does get very tiring

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
and i also know there are certain

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
microconferences that would in fact go

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,800
on for eight hours if we let them

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,039
you know who you are we do have hack

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,880
rooms available

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
these are open rooms that anybody can

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
use for conversations that

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
are going longer or other ideas or

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
things that pop up

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,759
as discussion these are based on a

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,680
first-come first-served basis

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
so please be a little bit mindful as you

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,919
use them

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,080
as with our in-person conferences

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,080
plumbers is going to be recorded and

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,919
there's also going to be a live stream

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
so please be mindful about what you are

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,319
saying again remember the code of

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,000
conduct

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,919
but also remember this is going to be

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,039
used for future references about what

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
exactly you signed up to do

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,520
and we do and as mentioned we do have a

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,840
separate chat system

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,919
called rocket chat there is going to be

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
a room for each program conference

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,960
so feel free to join any of those you'd

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,880
like

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
and this is also going to serve as our

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
hallway track for

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,240
any informal discussion you want to have

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
we do realize that a chat system can't

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
replace

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,960
actual inversion conversat in person

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
conversation but we're going to do our

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,280
best

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,360
the committee will be around for

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,199
questions during the core hours of

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,919

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,639
