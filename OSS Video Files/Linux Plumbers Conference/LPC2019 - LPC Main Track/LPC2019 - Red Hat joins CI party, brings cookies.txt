	Red Hat joins CI party, brings cookies

Description
For the past couple of years the CKI ("cookie") project at Red Hat has been transforming the way the company tests kernels, going from staged testing to continuous integration. We've been testing patches posted to internal maillists, responding with our results, and last year we started testing stable queues maintained by Greg KH, posting results to the "stable" maillist.

Now we'd like to expand our efforts to more upstream maillists, and join forces with CI systems already out there. We'll introduce you to the way our CI works, which tests we run, our extensive park of hardware, and how we report results. We'd like to hear what you need from a CI system, and how we can improve. We'd like to invite you to cooperation, both long-term, and right there, at a hackfest organized during the conference.

Naturally, real cookies will make an appearance.
