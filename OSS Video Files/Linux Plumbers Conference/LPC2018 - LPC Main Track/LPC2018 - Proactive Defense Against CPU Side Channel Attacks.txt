Side channel attacks are here to stay. What can we do inside the operating system to proactively defend against them? This talk will walk through a few of the ideas that Intelâ€™s Open Source Technology Center are developing to improve our resistance to side channel attacks as part of our new side channel defense project. We would also like to gather ideas from the rest of the community on what our top priorities for side channel defense for the Linux kernel should be.
