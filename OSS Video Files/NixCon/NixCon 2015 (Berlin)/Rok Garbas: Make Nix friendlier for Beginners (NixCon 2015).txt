okay the next

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,160
the next speaker is rock most of you

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
know him he's one of

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,359
the persons behind nick's conf um rock's

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,119
also the one who actually brought me to

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,320
nix i used to work with him together

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,320
about a year ago

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,160
and he did some very weird stuff that i

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,359
really didn't want to even look into

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,640
and and just about a year later i think

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,559
i'm completely infected and yes he wants

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
to talk about make mix friendlier for

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,280
beginners

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,960
okay i'm on so welcome

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,960
i have a small

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,840
okay so this is

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,960
okay so um this talk is a bit

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,520
it's any everything else but technical

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
um

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,040
it's something i've been basically doing

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
the whole year

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,320
but it's more uh it's about trying to

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
convince people

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,000
how to use next uh somehow successful

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,720
sometimes not but it's more of a

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,759
what i see people struggling with and

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,880
this is like the

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,360
report out after a year of

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,119
telling people yeah next next next mix

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,920
right so um so yeah the tweet the

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,759
conf my twitter um what i mean with

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
friendlier um

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,439
first uh this is very uh kind of

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,119
would be if i would give you now the

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
time to questions would be really bike

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,079
chatting like because

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,119
what's friendly or it's very subjective

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
so

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,960
i will make a definition what i meant

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
with friendlier is like if we can fix

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
something

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,040
in one day that will produce the 80

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,720
of the like the good stuff the the

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,720
usability improvements

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,840
that's what i'm aiming at right there

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
are some really

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
basic things we are just forgetting

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,720
about it because we are too deep

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
already right so like how the beginner

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
enters

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,720
it's um you will see in the slides

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
it's quite a different experience that

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
we as the users

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,560
uh it's basically also the ux from the

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
developers perspective how they see it

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,519
uh and what i mean also

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
usually you know there are kind of two

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,440
things which i like to emphasize

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
in the ux how to achieve better ux

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,920
really

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
cheaply um without any over engineering

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
which we tend to do is first the first

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,920
one is

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
you always go for what people expect um

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
and it is really easy to do what people

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,400
expect

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,440
because you just see what they're using

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,120
already and then you oh what overlaps

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,440
like a simple example is if you plan a

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,080
park and you see those crossing on the

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,680
edges

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,200
well that's the usability thing right

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
you didn't plan it correctly and this is

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,680
exactly what we need to do in our tools

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,720
um and there are multiple ways the

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,159
second thing is

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,840
um which i think is not only the the ux

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,080
part but it's also security one

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,440
is the default right what do you choose

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
for your default values

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,480
it's also a usability thing and

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,000
this sometimes is can be quite different

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,560
so i think we should focus on beginners

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,280
the the newbies to the project because

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
that's

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,400
actually how we will uh will rule the

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
world right

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,360
um world domination and yes actionable

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,239
things i want whatever we take from here

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
to actually

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,720
code on it and two days is totally

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,319
enough to implement every of this

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,640
90 um so basically

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,200
we'll go through the stages how i see

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,319
people are going when they are

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
entering nick's world uh

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,360
is first they have this first contact

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,799
right um

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
and then after that they tried to

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
install it uh then they got to know

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,000
all the tools and they read the

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
documentation

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,040
and then they if they like if every of

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
these

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,319
they succeed they kind of start

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
contributing right so this is like a

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,079
normal

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,560
flow you want to convince your co-worker

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,600
um

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,040
to start doing so the first contact nixo

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,080
nixos.org uh so

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
it's not really um

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,680
these are more like complaints we can

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
fix uh but it's

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
the first thing is very nice centric um

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,800
a lot of

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,880
developers i try to convince i have to

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
actually copy paste them to url you know

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,840
just add slash nics

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,240
and you will know everything about nick

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,440
so i think this should be a landing page

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,560
uh where you get everything uh

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
about um nicks and xos and how they

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
manage like

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,759
it's this is very hard to do in one page

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
but it should be like at least slowly

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,639
getting there we should have a landing

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,960
page for both projects

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
so you know how to choose one because

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,360
there is a low

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
well there is an overlap of features

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
right so we can do this um

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
everybody goes uh come on as docker

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,080
people

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,840
that five six minute video everybody

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,800
loves it but that's how you sell

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,280
and to the developers this is the the

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
thing

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,560
you don't need to place ads you need

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
five minute video

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
so people go it it's funny but yeah i

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
even

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,400
click a lot of times and probably you as

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,400
well

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
then usually when it comes it's like the

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,160
next step is

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
it's issue of trust who is using this

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
right so

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
why one of the why go is so successful

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,880
well you know

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,880
google starts with go right so um

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
and you're using it so that's where so

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
people want to see that you know they're

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
not alone

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,479
so there is a community and there are

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
actually companies

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,600
using it and kind of having the the use

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
cases that they use or examples how they

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
use it that would be a nice thing

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
and i guess it's also nice for companies

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,000
to have these kind of

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,759
white papers um uh it doesn't have to be

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,800
extra visible but it should be there

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
because that's

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,240
nice and what i found really

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,240
interesting is that we should be honest

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,520
like we're not the best tool out there

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,800
yet but we being honest

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,199
is like it

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
it pays off in the long run and if we

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,440
are not good at that to say we are not

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
good at it

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
um you know continue carefully reading

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,280
the communication for example right it's

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,840
this section is not good just honesty

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
really pays off and people appreciate it

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,600
um

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,520
so like we can completely say we are

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
small as a community but we have big

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,199
ideas

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,680
right that's people we understand this

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,080
part

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,919
so the next thing this is i mean the

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
front the first contact is really small

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,000
but it's

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
if i would not be sitting next to a

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,599
person

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
uh convincing him to go you know now try

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,560
and install it

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,639
they will never do the second step right

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,000
it's like people who are

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,639
uh coming over the internet uh searching

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,199
on the internet

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,720
searching for a solution and seeing it

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,960
that's

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
there is a potential there next thing is

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,039
installing so

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,240
who has problems installing nics and is

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,160
next user

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
uh probably you don't know right because

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,599
you're you installed

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,280
makes in 2008 right

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,039
and it's just running since then and

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,160
it's happily and

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,360
there are many first thing is we are

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,360
using curl right and it's yeah there's

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,479
not started not started it's a huge

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,680
debate

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,840
i don't care but uh the whole thing

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
even if let's say this is okay to do the

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,720
installation

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,639
it's breaking it's really fragile and

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
we as nics we should we are the ones who

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
saying like hey just you know copy the

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,039
closure it's everything is there

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,840
and it should be that solid right um

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
i have a solution in the next slide but

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,479
um

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,080
next week's install that's one of the

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
things that a lot of times happen is it

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,240
should be offline

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,120
um installation like uh half a year ago

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,879
it wasn't when i tried and it's

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
i think i guess the problem is not that

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,400
it's we don't want it to be but it's

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,319
hard to test and there should be way to

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,879
know that we can install it offline that

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
basic setup i mean right so we need to

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,840
mix configure the basic setup should

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,560
just uh

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,479
uh run without touching the the internet

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,759
and to go back on the first thing right

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,120
so

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:38,719
uh what um i did that road code

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,560
uh what we did at road code was um we

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
we went with building a standalone

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,120
executable right so

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,720
uh because we are

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
we are python developers we of course

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
solve this in python

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
is this writing i don't know it's very

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
easy to do it and it's

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,760
nice quick and i did it in two hours

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,440
right and

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,000
since then we don't have any problems

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,320
like if a build if a download

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,440
stops or the connection is slow how do

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
resume and everything

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
no you download the whole thing you run

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
it and you have an offline installation

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
uh well that was

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,839
one of the requirements to have but how

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,480
did we do it um so

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,560
in python there is this thing um if you

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,279
create a folder and you put inside

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
the underscore underscore main.pi and

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,640
you zip that thing

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
and you execute it that python file will

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,399
get executed

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
uh now in zip file you can also put the

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,279
whole closure of next right

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,160
and that install um

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,800
that that python code will actually

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
extract

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
the tarball unpack it um and just

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
install it right and

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,120
that's the whole point like as the as

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,959
being deep in nyx you don't see the

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,680
benefit because it's like yeah

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,440
why would i care but this is actually

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
saving a lot of customers a lot of

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,200
overhead

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,959
a lot of bugs right like system is down

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,800
this is not working uh this is that 80

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,120
which you can do in one hour or two

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,839
right that's usability from

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,839
beginners which we are not seeing as a

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,880
yes yes so why python uh also

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,079
uh you could use any other tool if we

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,519
can compile and then just

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,240
uh have a binary static

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,519
linked but python is more or less on all

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
the platforms

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,480
to write a simple script which work

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,480
across python23 and python35

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
it's possible and for that little

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,720
functionality which you need to entire

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,880
and

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
just installed it's doable it's not that

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,200
hard

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,440
so it's it's a quick solution

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,560
we could deploy tomorrow that's the

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,240
thing like then

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,000
if you want to improve it to have this

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,800
standalone executable in another

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,640
language

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,000
because it's for whatever reason better

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,160
let's do it but

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,680
this we can have tomorrow right um

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:58,480
tooling we already talked about um

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,720
uh ilco talked about that we should

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,480
improve the command line tool um

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,320
i did my research um i took the

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
i in the slides there are only two tools

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,640
but i uh also looked at not

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
apt-get because that's really ancient

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,600
and

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,120
i don't get a command line interface

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,240
there

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,720
makes a bit sense but not that much in

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
the

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,000
new age of hipsters so i took

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
the example here is how they install

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,600
packages right is it's

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,240
exactly how we do it makes no sense and

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,640
we want this right it's um i actually

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,920
picked

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,200
um basically only what we can do

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,640
in the tomorrow uh that that i only pick

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
few commands which are

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,680
overlapping over all package managers

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
right i didn't go

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,880
to all of them all support everything i

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,320
just want the basic people want to

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
install packages

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
and people want mix install something

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,800
right

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,279
the other side of it is uninstall right

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,639
so

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,399
the same thing like when somebody runs

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,160
sneak uninstall if you just run nix

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,000
and e right so it's in your head in your

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
language you already see how easy this

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
is to implement

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
do you know how help how much you're

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,240
helping the beginners

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,800
like a lot a ton right because the first

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
thing is

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,120
uh people don't read documentation when

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,839
they are trying out the common line

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,279
tools

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,959
that's how it is they even don't open

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,079
man page but they kind of the first

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
thing they say oh i want to install a

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,800
package nick's installed

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,399
and they wrote it and i was like enter

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
it was like oh stop that's not how it

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,600
works

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,800
it's like this this is the that path of

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
the ux which you

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,839
the the users expect and you should

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,839
provide it right

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
um

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,320
okay um to repeat the thing

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,760
this was uh so the current situation how

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
we have it uh it's

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,480
taken from the rpm how they did it in

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,800
2001 okay guys

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,639
yeah okay so in from the 90s right um

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,079
i'm just saying like it's not that the

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,519
thing that is this is bro like

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,519
we have broken tools and everything no

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,560
we have good tools tools are working

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,120
it's just that 80 what people expect and

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,440
this is

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
uh the really important the ux of the

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,600
the for developers

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
next set of commands is search right

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
this is then echo

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,880
uh how do you call this package right

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,399
and then they search for it like

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,160
everybody has search commands right um

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,160
right uh it's okay right i mean

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,240
i i don't care like you know for me

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,360
zeitgeist autocompletes but

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,839
for a beginner ah you know um

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,000
you want this right uh the opposite of

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,480
this

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
install packages right um it's listing

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,360
the packages it's

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
this is also what do i have installed so

00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
i can uninstall it right that's the

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,639
common thing

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,920
and yes it's

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,920
did they do it right or did they i was

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,360
uh the presentation was done around four

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
in the morning so

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,560
probably i did mistakes oh that should

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,839
be dash dash installed right

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,839
but okay

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,639
yeah this was from yeah i started in

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,639
using mix in 2010 so

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,880
yeah so there are still users doing this

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,930
way just for the camera

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,440
okay um the next thing oh hi guys

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,320
[Applause]

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,320
okay see

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,880
interesting things happen upgrade

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,040
command it's

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,680
uh some people call it update so there

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,199
was what upgrade update um

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,800
i don't know i started calling it

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,360
upgrade because it was the most common

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,279
one

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,399
because a lot of projects have aliases

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,519
and the upgrade was

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,519
you want to upgrade so we do this

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,040
of course we also in all the commands i

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
wrote two commands because

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,959
um there's another topic uh which we

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,320
already covered we will start using

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,480
attribute uh paths or names right

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,360
which is awesome um we should do it

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,399
because it's just

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
makes like less things to know it's

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,720
better

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,839
right the less is more um and then yes

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,000
this is how it should look and oh

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,120
and the next thing which i you would not

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,480
believe it but are

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,120
awesome really important for the the

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,160
how people feel the project how they do

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,160
they trust it

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,680
it's not about yes they it actually

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
doesn't matter about the beginning when

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,199
i said that you need use cases what they

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,120
want is

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:48,959
colors ascii art and emojis

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:52,560
right i'm not joking i'm serious

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:56,160
right it's no um

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,959
it's this makes it crispy it looks like

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,000
it's new

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,279
it's like recent this is the you know

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,079
the hot thing

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,639
it's like oh it looks like almost like

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,240
docker

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,120
you see that familiarity right from the

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,560
outside

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,240
okay um but um so what i want to

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
emphasize here it's

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,759
even different point we already said we

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,079
are moving that way um

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,440
doing the ux is not like oh let's just

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,160
code it and it's going to be like this

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
and it's good

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,519
this is the wrong approach it's it's a

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
path to failure

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
uh because you know once you give

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,480
something out people expect it and it's

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,759
hard to break that promise

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
i would suggest we use current tools we

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
have

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,880
and start experimenting and building

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,440
tools that will call those sub tools and

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,759
let's

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,800
experiment i mean these commands are

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,880
make they make sense

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,880
we can i already implemented it

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,560
we need to experiment how users perceive

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,560
that does it make sense

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,040
and it's okay to implement this in kind

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,079
of i don't know python

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,639
whatever until and then once we freeze

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
the

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,800
functionality the commands yes then

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,759
let's implement it how we wanted it

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,039
right it's

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,319
that research uh of what users what is

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,880
the expected way

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,000
what's the best way needs to take uh

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,120
stages and that's

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,760
i mean it's a basic how uh the designers

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,199
work or

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,240
ux guys we need also in our

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,240
tools bring that

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,640
workflow um so yeah emojis remember

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,120
we're gonna have emojis yes emoji is

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,720
there

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,760
please what do we have

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,590
pony oh yeah we have

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,760
ponies some thing yeah okay

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,039
[Music]

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,039
more the better um

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,520
documentation

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,520
so documentation is

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,880
everybody is not happy but nobody wants

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,000
to do anything right that's the

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,480
kind of thing i want to go

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,919
differently way and ask ourselves why do

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,039
we want documentation

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,520
right why do you write documentation is

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,480
it

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,440
for yourself um like why do we write the

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,960
whole manual

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,080
is what's the reason is

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,000
my opinion bringing somebody who is

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,600
beginner to the advanced level right and

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,520
you know you cannot just um you know as

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,360
uh when i started spanish right you just

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,600
not uh

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,520
we i will never learn spanish if you

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,160
just show me a dictionary right and it's

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,280
like

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,480
manual here it is learn it done right it

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,280
doesn't work that way

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
how you do it is you need you need to be

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,440
taught you need

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,039
somebody to teach you right so the

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,960
teaching part is the problem and

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,400
when you do documentation it should be

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,799
about teaching

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,080
and the the

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
once you know why you write

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,120
documentation you also clearly more

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
defined

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,200
how you write it right it's you have to

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
when you're teaching somebody and

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
teaching is

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,280
really hard especially writing

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,480
documentation because you don't sit next

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,559
to the person you don't see the

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,600
expression when it goes like what

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,240
happened right

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,520
you don't see that you have to take it

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,360
through steps

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,640
make it sure it's kind of bulletproof

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,120
and uh

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,559
learning this uh it's very hard there

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
isn't profession about it

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
technical writers right but it's but

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,720
even

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,400
basic stuff in the next like in open

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,799
source community should be

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,840
dealt with it like you should your

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,400
manual should be

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,600
done in a way where they teach and then

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
they don't tell

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,640
so the outcome of this documentation

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,760
should be teaching

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,280
and not telling okay

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,200
so there is one with sting which i

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,400
always point people to because it's just

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,120
enormous resource and it's the that lib

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
folder

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,960
you open all these files it's amazing

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,640
thing what you can do with the language

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,320
it's just hidden right

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,080
i'm not saying we should use docstrings

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,000
but we should document that

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,320
i don't know how whatever we do

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,159
it's documented and it's documented good

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,000
so we have the documentation

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,280
we just don't expose it so this is like

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,880
you never point to

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,640
uh somebody saying hey just read the

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
source right it's like or you read the

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,440
doctrines it's

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,080
no way right it should be there um but

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
yes so

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,919
this is one of the things we can fix

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,200
probably in the sprint

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,000
uh question there no just remark

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,799
the problem is even one step before it

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
took me

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,640
over two weeks to figure out that there

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,520
is a third manual for next packages

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
oh oh yeah so that's actually the

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,480
discoverability in the

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,840
like getting to um uh like first contact

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
with next so you know that

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,840
oh there is every project is a has a

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,840
documentation so that would be

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,760
yes there is a documentation for next

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,520
packages yes

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,960
good okay but you see this is

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,960
okay so i already told this but

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,880
we should teach and we shouldn't tell

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,559
like this should be the approach we take

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,520
and i'm not saying that manual we have

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,400
currently it's

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,679
now throw it away no we the manual is

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,799
good

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,000
it's it has everything inside but it's i

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,960
will i'm using it

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
right and i'm a few years developer of

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,200
next or

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,159
kind of trying to be right it's we need

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,280
tutorials

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,000
right which are going to tell you how to

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
use next

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
what are the types what are the you know

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,280
basic types that like

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,039
tell you go through like you know

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,000
usually if you want to teach somebody to

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,840
drive

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
imagine you'll get the you know oh new

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,320
bmv you give him the bmv manual

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,039
it was like you know that's it read it

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,559
and drive it

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,159
it doesn't work like that right you have

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,960
to take the hand and take them all the

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,200
way step

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,799
if you see they fail you know you cry

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,520
with them right this is the whole point

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,600
like

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,400
um so

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
this is empire so and then the last

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,760
thing

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
um this might this might be a bit

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,000
personal

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,120
uh but kill the wiki right

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,159
uh the wiki is not documentation

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,600
uh actually the wiki is abundant

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,039
abomination it's basically the worst

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,240
part of documentation

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,480
right because um

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,000
have you ever taken a class where the

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,480
you have multiple teachers

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,840
that's that's the wiki right everybody

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
writes in their own style

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,919
but okay you can read different you know

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,080
but everybody teaches differently right

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,080
and

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,360
and sometimes actually happens is uh

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,200
you know as the developer says uh

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,000
you started oh let's just set up a wiki

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,520
and then let's wait because

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,200
documentation will come right

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,159
do the basics and then it will come it's

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
like and then beginners

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,200
come to us and it's like oh yeah well

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
you know we don't have time just you

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,520
know update the wiki

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,320
no now imagine being at the spanish

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,000
class

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,440
and coming there and it's like oh there

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,360
is a bug in the

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,520
the notebook and they say you just oh

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,600
just go fix it yourself

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,640
seriously it's we would turn around and

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,679
go right it's

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,039
so wikis are not documentation um

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,880
more you know that when you have in the

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,880
primary school usually happened to me it

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,679
was like there was one jerk

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
being there you know just being loud

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,559
right and

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
this is and it takes the whole steers

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,960
the whole class and

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,840
if you consider yourself being in that

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,080
class

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,960
like everybody fails there right it's

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,360
because of that

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
one person and this is really easy to

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,279
achieve

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:46,240
with wiki style um

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,039
oh yeah i'm better removing all the wiki

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,600
we have

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,520
than having wiki because no

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,159
documentation is better than false

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,159
documentation

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,520
some more you know i find that i'd

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
rather figure it out on my own than

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,000
actually

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,799
write like giving having false promises

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,520
and then you know this was in 2006 whoa

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,600
okay

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,960
you know i know this will never work but

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,960
does the beginner

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,880
yeah one thing i also keep firm believe

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,200
is that

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
if you keep documentation in the wiki

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,000
there is no way you'll

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,679
have it in the place where it should be

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,080
which is next to the code

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,720
so you should treat documentation as

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,480
code

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
like we read javascript as a programming

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,279
language we also need to keep

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,720
documentation

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:39,600
close to code no

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,559
no come on it's javascript no javascript

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,120
in the beginning was

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,960
really hard language only when it has

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
tools we could start reading it i'm no

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,840
joking

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,279
it's good language now because of the

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,679
tools right

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,799
and the same thing we need to apply to

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,919
documentation

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,080
you know that's and

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,440
having it alongside the code helps a lot

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,919
because usually the ones

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,799
who are the teachers are the developers

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,240
and they should be

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,240
right especially in the open source

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,679
communities in companies you have

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,120
special creatures um

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:18,320
yes okay so

00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,320
who is to kill the wiki we do it okay

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:26,159
yes um the last

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,279
step right um so let's say the person

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,279
goes through all of this

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
all the pain does documentation does

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,320
extra homework

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:36,480
um decides to contribute um

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,799
what i we found i think we saw from the

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,000
slides from elko's was that

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:46,559
which year did we convert to github

00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,080
2012. that was like after 2010

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,919
and there was like really a spike up

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,760
right this was a good decision

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,840
not because github is awesome but

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,240
because it brings that social effect

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:03,120
and you can argue it's not but

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,120
we have proof right it really spikes um

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,960
it's also the discoverability so the

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,559
thing i mentioned in the beginning

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,400
also from the code point perspective

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,720
it's more discoverable as a project

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,480
and people is like easy to contribute

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,440
even if it's just a typo right

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,840
and yeah the whole pr having a review

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,880
process before something comes

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,840
people see this as a barrier i'm seeing

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
it as a

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,360
as a teaching process right so this is

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,520
where you learn

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,440
you commit something and people tell you

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,679
it's like hey there are better solutions

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
and after that pull request you come out

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
smarter

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,000
and that's the whole point even i

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
sometimes comment on pull requests

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
and me as a teacher i learn stuff right

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,559
and it's that's also the process it's

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,840
if you don't understand something in a

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,279
pull request ask

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,039
you know maybe the implementer will

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,799
actually tell you and you will know more

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,120
right pull requests are a process of

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,480
to learn right that's at least my

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,000
experience is a good thing i mean

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
eventually they have to get merged so

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,039
you have to end up discussion but yes

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,080
it's a

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,840
review process um so yes

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,919
then the next thing i want to mention is

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,159
i think dorman yes

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,880
so he posted the tweet that we are

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:18,159
receiving 440 almost

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,200
pull requests per month right um

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,559
and then we know it's a lot of pull

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,120
requests right then we close

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,679
quite a big chunk of it the question was

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,320
like

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,520
how many uh committers do you have like

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,960
the push

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,960
right 65

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,919
how many active really so it's not about

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,520
like pointing out who is inactive that's

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,360
not the point um

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,679
i want to point different things out

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,679
it's

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,320
there is a barrier which kind of people

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,039
don't even notice that the pull request

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,320
need needs them because they are not

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,960
tagged automatically

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,840
right i think pull request to some

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,080
extent

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,679
is it this a darving thing uh that

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,399
something gets rebuilt

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,520
should actually include all the you can

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,760
get the top level

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,120
we can automate a bit of it like just to

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
know who is actually

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,720
the top level packages they're being

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,799
changed who is the maintainer

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,480
at them automatically i think this is

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,799
possible via travis

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,000
and some shell scripting or python or

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,760
perl or

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,279
javascript or haskell

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,200
so automatically assign maintainers to

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,919
review pull requests

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,760
this is the d thing right because if a

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,960
maintainer who is actually

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,600
listed there would know that somebody

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,960
updated he would go there and review the

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,080
thing

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,559
in not every time but in 90 of the cases

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,000
and this will offload the one who has

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,360
pull request

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,600
a lot right uh yes the question

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,320
there is a mic um i also wanted to say

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,640
as a contributor it's not always clear

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,720
if it's gonna be reviewed or when or

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,679
who's going to do it i think it'll be

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,240
really cool

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,600
yeah so having these automated things

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,640
i'm not saying we should go all the way

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,360
right this is

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,760
whatever we can do let's do it right um

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,000
that's

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,120
whatever we can do in the sprinting days

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,279
let's just do it and

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,120
you know like how how the docker or the

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,240
chorus guy says like ship it

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,279
you know um let's do it it's

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,640
really will bring the effect right um

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,520
and yeah so this is a bit i'm gonna

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,520
before i press

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,600
disclaimer uh it's a bit controversial

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,640
how i wrote it i'm not good sometimes at

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,760
expressing without my hands and

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,640
um let me wait between you judge

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,720
um committer should be in be invited to

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,000
step away if not having enough time

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,159
um this is not to

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,799
say to kind of oh you don't have time go

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,120
away right this is not thing it's

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,559
it should be a there if there is a way

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,640
in in the this core

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,480
group there should be also a way out

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,559
because maybe next year

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,039
i will not have enough time and i would

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,080
like so what's the perceived value is

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,919
we have 65 committers up right

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,159
so now somebody looks and would like to

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,640
be a committer as well and have enough

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,159
time

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,159
he sees it as like oh there is enough

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,720
guys right it's i'm not needed

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,480
and that's the how it is perceived and

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,399
why nobody is actually

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,039
uh coming as a new committer and having

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,640
the time

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,080
and it's the other way around i want to

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
have

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,120
a lot of this cycle that developers can

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,240
come

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,679
and go out and just it's okay if you

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,880
don't have time i mean it happens right

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,600
babies get born

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:46,880
marriage you break a leg you go surfing

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,880
so yeah so um

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,039
so i kind of pointed out now all the

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,159
where i see

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,720
uh at least from my

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,519
let's say this was like a year a bit

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,760
more

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,039
progress a year and a half when i was

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,360
going to conferences

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,039
and talking with different companies and

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,480
trying to convince them to use nix and

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,200
this were all the points right there are

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,240
many more

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,519
but this is something i pointed out

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,720
that is solvable now this topic

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,399
is a bit by shedding as i mentioned

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,279
so everybody has their own opinion but

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,480
if you when you ask questions now and or

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,120
do proposals because

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
we need them um can you try to stick

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,240
into that

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,399
do it in the two days time and um bring

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,399
eighty percent of the value if you have

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,440
some proposals and questions or

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,799
if i did some mistakes um

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,120
we can talk about wiki later but uh

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,519
yeah um this is my last slide so

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,519
thank you

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,720
yes we have about i think 10 minutes for

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,519
questions and one question is already

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
pending

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,480
and afterwards we also have an

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,840
announcement so please don't run

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,840
directly away after the talk

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,120
hi um about the pull request

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,720
thing i think automating um tagging them

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,760
is a really good idea

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,799
um but i consider this also a problem of

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,240
github itself

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:30,000
because i want to have

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,080
the possibility to tag and assign

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
maintainers for issues or pull requests

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,279
but i don't want to have

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,440
push access to master because i i myself

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,600
consider pushing to master a bad style

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,760
and i don't want to have that right but

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,880
i want to be able to do

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,159
sorting out issues closing them if

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,799
they're

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,640
already done or something and assigned

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,279
texts and so on and

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,000
i don't have that possibility on github

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,159
and i asked

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,919
github like two times i guess maybe

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,960
three times

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,600
almost a year ago now and it's always

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,440
yeah we are thinking about that and i

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,919
guess if we as a community

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,760
can go to github and say hey we would

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,960
really like this feature

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,159
i guess maybe we can get it no

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,960
i'm not going to look at it just um

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,360
we are too small they care but not

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,559
enough

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,720
for us it's okay this is how the world

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,120
is right but it's

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,720
true that we cannot get into the perfect

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,519
world where everything is automatically

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,000
tagged but

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,640
you know having a tag even just adding

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,679
them and

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,159
like a responsible there that's possible

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,080
through a travis hook uh which then

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,960
figures out we have knocks already which

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,960
does the build

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,159
why not build something there around it

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,240
that will

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,000
it this is possible i'm not going into

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,399
extreme it's like everybody wants you

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,440
know

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,279
ice cream with everything on top let's

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,399
just get you know

00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,640
how to say kane right like just basic

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,640
stuff

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,480
um just in terms of narrative

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,640
documentation i think

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,560
little man's nix pills does a great job

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,839
at that and maybe it might be a quick

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,480
win if we could

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,679
hook that up uh or make it more visible

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,639
on the nexus

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,839
or website that might be good yeah um

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,879
those who you don't know

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,000
uh is it public now right

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,000
they released it already

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,919
okay uh anyway i think there is a lot of

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,839
these tutorials

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,240
how to do the you know the teaching part

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,440
um

00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,240
i'm bad at teaching i know i

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,879
need to improve and it's like everybody

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,320
here i

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,520
guess should improve um

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,040
yeah other side i

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,720
i don't have a recipe how to improve

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,960
like just try it and

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,000
fail you know the same thing learn to

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,320
learn how to

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,520
learn how to teach yeah so i want to

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,760
respond to your

00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,839
remark about maybe we should make it

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,280
more visible for example these blog

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,680
posts that lethal manners

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,400
wrote because it's excellent actually

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
but

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,920
in my opinion the nix community has

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,599
always been about doing people just

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,200
taking initiative so make sure you

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,280
actually take that initiative

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,640
so not only of course it's good to have

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
ideas but

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,480
this could have been for example in this

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
case you can just make a pull request to

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,359
the

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,040
nixos website and i'm sure it'll be

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,240
added let's say within a day so this is

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,880
typically something

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,480
that can be done quite quickly and there

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,640
are probably many things so

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,240
if you want to do something just do it

00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,800
yeah

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,000
so actionable small things um we have in

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,240
front here

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,240
uh i think that's the whole point like

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,480
we

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,839
we could go really like do the whole

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,760
analysis but we know

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,040
those little things that we can actually

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,599
fix right now

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,400
i mean i saw this idea of having nick's

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,440
install

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,839
next uninstall next shell and so on

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,720
commands i really like it i mean i

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,480
already mentioned it in his talk by the

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,640
way it should also be extensible like

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,000
the kit where you can just add a new

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,720
sub command but about the next upgrade

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,480
command

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,400
i i think actually that one shouldn't

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,480
exist uh

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,000
which one the next upgrade command so

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,200
maybe the underlying command should

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,880
still exist but

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:26,000
i mean like when i when i

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,200
try to update an imperative package i

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,240
usually prefer to just use nix and

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,599
i again because that has more

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,640
predictable or

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,839
like more intuitive behavior you see the

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,720
thing is you're thinking from your

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,280
perspective

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,920
no no no thinking from the beginners yes

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,560
but for the

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,800
beginner's perspective like okay from

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,880
next upgrade

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,920
it's it's more intuitive than nyx and

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,680
view sure

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,480
but it's still like very confusing

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,520
semantics and if we if you make like a

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,400
nicer

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,040
syntax for it uh that that that won't

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,119
make the semantics nicer so

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,560
definitely i'm saying we should put a

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,119
bit of lipstick on a pig

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,320
yeah right but this is really these five

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,480
commands are

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,920
across all package managers people

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,680
expect these commands

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,520
right and they are basically if you're

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,079
using nix the package manager

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,880
they have to be installed uninstall um

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,119
list

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
search maybe you could just make upgrade

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:28,000
and synonym for installment

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,000
i mean you want to see how it works

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,960
how do i do it bigger

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,920
this part doesn't matter you just

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,400
function the trends command but

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,079
there is a main command with a bit of

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,640
documentation

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,079
it has this is the sub command which is

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,520
called install

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,960
uh it does run nick's m-i and you have

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,440
uninstall you have search you have

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,200
list and search what i'm trying to say

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,079
i'm not saying this let's put it into

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,040
next right

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,320
wrong this is easy way how to experiment

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,000
let's package it and let's give it to a

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,440
few users let's try to

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,839
you know like that's the whole point

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,760
like maybe upgrade is a bad idea

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,680
right but this is the way how we will

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,359
know it it's experiments

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:21,119
you know people like to be test

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,680
mouses rabbits guinea pigs yeah

00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,680
that animal

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,040
not that interesting but maybe instead

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,119
of

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,960
infusing the idea of there is an upgrade

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,760
into users just say

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,400
there is no upgrade version if they

00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,520
execute

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,520
next upgrade let's say this comment

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,400
doesn't exist maybe you meant

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,599
install instead of upgrade oh yeah like

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,599
suggestions that's

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,760
part of it no the semantics isn't even

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,440
existing please use the other one

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
but you know that upgrade exists right

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,119
it's a okay but you know people are bad

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,640
like through that uh yeah

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,560
one more uh i think that the

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,400
nyx packages documentation should be

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,720
updated more frequently

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,839
because because like i use it as a

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,200
reference for myself

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,200
for stuff that i've written because i

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,119
can't remember how to use it and so

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,640
it's it's it's really easy when you make

00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,079
a pull request that you put in a new

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,800
function in mixed packages that you

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,880
should just

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,040
automatically go and edit the nyx

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,280
packages documentation at the same time

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,560
i guess in part of our pull request

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,880
review process we should

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,640
also see do we need to update like that

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,520
question do we need to update the

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,079
uh documentation like the manual because

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,079
that's

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,280
it at least the manual always has to be

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,680
perfect that's
