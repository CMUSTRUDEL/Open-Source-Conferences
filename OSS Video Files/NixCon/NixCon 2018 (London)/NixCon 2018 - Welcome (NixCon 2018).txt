facilitator of sorts your for Nick's con

say is welcome to next con 2018 awesome

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:28,650
[Applause]

00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:30,750
okay so first things first the SSID and

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,189
the password is right here so if you

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,140
want to you know like start some mixed

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,739
bills and crash Wi-Fi while other people

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,030
are talking now is your time so many you

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:49,320
may want to take a picture of that and

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:52,370
start building right away okay and we

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,289
will come to exactly that in a moment

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,680
yeah but before that so I'm really happy

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,440
that makes the next con is starting

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,470
again for the third time now I believe

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,270
we've got 120 people from all over the

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,880
place obviously from London from Europe

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,290
from from the states a couple of people

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,810
jet lagging through their experience

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,100
here but I'm hope in the course of the

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,740
next three days you will saw a sort of

00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,810
get into it so that you can crash a

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,650
crash into the jet lag when you get back

00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,460
home again right okay

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,500
so I think looking around it's it's very

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,810
much a community event right

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,630
and so looking around you you will

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,840
probably see a lot of familiar faces so

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,079
just maybe to get a quick show of hands

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,329
who has been to a mix cone before raise

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,850
your hand okay that's plenty of people

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,310
so who's whose it was at an ex-con for

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,530
the first time oh wow

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,509
alrighty

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,280
that is that is that is actually

00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:59,950
brilliant because it clearly shows that

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,420
we are that we are growing and and that

00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,890
NYX is about to take over the world

00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:06,700
which is I'm sure going to happen any

00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:10,450
any time now so yeah ask questions and

00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,010
have a good time and so the next thing

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:17,319
that I want to get to right away is

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:19,930
sponsors so without sponsors this event

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,890
certainly wouldn't be taking place I can

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,650
already say that

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:25,120
London is pretty bloody expensive at

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,790
least compared to where where I come

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,170
from my hotel is pardon my french

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:33,910
and still very expensive and so likewise

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,680
for for Yves to get this place and

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,709
everything else we clearly need sponsors

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,500
and fortunately we do have sponsors and

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,750
we have a couple of gold sponsors and

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,250
one of them is is num tight so maybe you

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:53,230
can give them a quick round of applause

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,549

00:02:54,549 --> 00:03:02,049

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,739
a lot of you know them also so also

00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,739
