	This talk is going to cover how to best use Cachix in hobby and professional manner to ease development and adoption of Nix. Talk is also going to cover the motivation how Cachix came to be, what are the design decision behind it and their consequences, usage statistics and where it's possibly headed. --- Bio: Domen Kozar: I've started using Nix in 2012 and after years of many contributions in free time, started using Nix exclusively in 2016 packaging up OpenStack and functional testing a cluster with scenarios. In 2016 I've founded Enlambda consulting which helped many clients like Snabb and IOHK to adopt Nix as a way to solve interesting complex software distribution problems in our industry. Robert Hensing: Nix user since early 2016, Nix and Haskell freelancer  since 2017. You may have caught him on stack overflow with a solution,  advice or bad news. He is convinced that the future is not just  immutable, but functional.
