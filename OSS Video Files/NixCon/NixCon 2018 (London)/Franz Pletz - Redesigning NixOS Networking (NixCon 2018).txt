Title: Franz Pletz - Redesigning NixOS Networking (NixCon 2018)
Publication date: 2018-10-28
Playlist: NixCon 2018 (London)
Description: 
	Description:NixOS networking has been the source of weird bugs for years. There is no simple mapping between systemd units and the setup and teardown of network interfaces and its interdependencies. The systemd project is aware of that and implemented systemd-networkd to manage networking configuration. There even is a second implementation of the NixOS networking interface that uses systemd-netword but in its current state has some drawbacks and inconsistencies that prevent using it by default.

The question for NixOS is if the adoption of systemd-networkd is desired and if a redesign of the current config interface to support as much features as possible is needed. This talk presents my findings around the topic, some design ideas concerning a possible interface and my personal wishlist of useful and cool networking features that should be supported.
