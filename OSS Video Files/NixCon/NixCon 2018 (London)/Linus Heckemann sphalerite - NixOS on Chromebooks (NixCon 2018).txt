hello everyone I'm I'm Linus this is my

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,030
Chromebook

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,130
I got Nick's OS running on it a while

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:18,150
ago and what's nice about it is it's

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:20,939
it's an ARM based device which means

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:23,310
that it uses a lot less battery than

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:33,420
into our best devices also it's cool

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:39,149
because it's not Intel and yeah so if I

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:41,370
can show what it looks like I'm not sure

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,890
it'll automatically does anyone know if

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,320
slim automatically turns on external

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,129
displays okay I'll need to fiddle with R

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,129
and R then but

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,890
right there we go so this is actually

00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,890
that font a bit smaller

00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:30,939
yeah so as you can see it's 64-bit and

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:35,380
it runs next to us quite quite well so

00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:37,780
if I want to play nethack I can just use

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,000
next Shell and thankfully almost

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:49,679
everything is in the cache

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,119
thanks to well thanks to Graham and and

00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:59,229
no thanks to this the internet

00:01:52,119 --> 00:02:03,549
connection here yeah so it's pretty it's

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:05,709
pretty nice I can I don't I don't need

00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:09,220
to know don't need to fiddle around as

00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:11,590
much with with building stuff for hours

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:14,069
on end like I did with my premium

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,079
previous Chromebook which was 32-bit arm

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,920
and I'm very happy with it so if if

00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:23,260
anyone's interested in trying something

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,880
fairly different in terms of hardware I

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,349
can absolutely recommend getting a

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,209
Chromebook and trying to get an exhaust

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,209
running on it there you go

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,949
