so on on the topic of Nixon Haskell

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,960
young weekly the maintainer of Emacs

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,010
started an alternative implementation of

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,670
Nick's in Haskell

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:18,750
it's called H Nick's right now it's a

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,609
parser complete parser it's a yeah not

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,420
so complete evaluator but but quite

00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,640
there and it's it's it's what it's

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,800
experimenting with type checking as well

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,510
although it's not there yet yeah that's

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,809
kind of the current state it also has a

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,579
pretty printer for Nick's github and

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:45,059
yeah there's some Doc's how to get

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,690
started um devices so the next packages

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,629
the next tests and so on so I'm gonna

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,239
show you what you can do with it today

00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:58,260
we have Nick's on the left the nicks and

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,829
H Nick's on the right so for example if

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,519
you do this in annex you will get just

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:09,060
that an attribute a is missing which is

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:13,409
a constant pain during development H

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,939
Nick's will ya

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,439
show you the actual attribute that

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:22,170
you're looking trying to look up and

00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,689
gives you a bit more information there

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,460
are still some errors like that are not

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,060
that great for example if you do

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,060
something like this

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:37,240
yeah it's still needs room there is

00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,610
still room for improvements so one of

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,409
the goals of maze h6 there is no

00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:45,159
official roadmap but one of the goals is

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:47,259
to provide a better user experience and

00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,710
this comes to error messages and other

00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:54,549
things and to provide good tooling so we

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:57,069
could create for example there is very

00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:58,840
good support of creating interactive

00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,509
debugger that you could go to different

00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,429
stacked stacks in the stack trace and

00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:05,530
see what are the variables inside and

00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,380
and figure out you know what went wrong

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,539
of course for for infinite recursion

00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,780
error that's not that helpful but for

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:16,569
everything else it should be as I've

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:21,599
said it also has a formatter so you can

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,599
just run it like on if I have

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,260
file like this that's pretty I'm just

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,549
so it has a pretty printer and it kind

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,440
of works there's just one problem and

00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:47,090
I'll show you which is what I want to

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:53,060
hack on tomorrow so yeah this is a

00:02:47,090 --> 00:03:00,170
simple file from mixed packages and if

00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:02,540
you run it it will pretty print it the

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,590
only problem is it's it strips comments

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,959
at the moment it doesn't support

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,940
comments so this is something I want to

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,120
add it's not a trio because comments can

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,359
appear pretty much everywhere but it

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,359
formatted pretty nicely let me show you

00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:20,950
another thing so if you do a typo for

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,950
example here

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,550
and we'll it will show you where the you

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,980
know actuals

00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,650
in source where the problem is and it

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,320
will tell you I expected this no I got

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,850
unexpected character and and I got you

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,210
know I expected this for three things

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,490
this is all basically Haskell libraries

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:45,030
by default do very good job for parsing

00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:47,790
and so on so yeah I would recommend it

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,280
to to try it out for error messages and

00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,800
if you think that can be improved open

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,490
an issue and for pretty printing once

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,310
the comments work the evaluation itself

00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,320
it doesn't actually provide the correct

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,630
hashes for the for the Knicks so it's

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,920
not that useful yeah that's they have a

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,920
hackathon I think in

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,760
yeah that's it

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,779
