okay

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:25,260
hello so so here's a similar the new

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:28,590
release manager now right so it's the

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,300
new release manager like the upcoming

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:37,890
one where I'm handing over the

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:43,980
management to him continually and well

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:50,520
first we'll again show just a bit of

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:56,309
some statistics similarly to what you

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,340
might have seen on last Nick scorn but

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:03,510
yeah well though they haven't really

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:09,810
changed that much since they're well you

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:13,830
can see like like on the whole the

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,740
activity is continually rising you can

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,259
see this for example on the number of

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,820
issues that are created like the last

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:29,490
year isn't complete yet so it's still

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:35,450
still growing when compared to last year

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,450
last year's 2017 well about their

00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:46,079
software sorry the point was about there

00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,549
when the presentation was made so if we

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,460
compare we are already over

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,740
what last year's

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,410
amount of issues open at the same time

00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,990
so we're probably going to overshoot the

00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:04,150
number of issues opened last year for

00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:08,020
this year next the number of issues by

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:11,230
user it's pretty similar to what was

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,380
last year the top three is the same top

00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,690
three as last year I don't know if

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:20,320
there's any such surprise since it's not

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:27,340
the issues open since since that series

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:30,850
since forever so the core temp and PTI

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:34,750
will need to work a bit more if you they

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,700
want to be on the top three but pretty

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:39,700
much every other names just switch

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,820
around in there and the same happen for

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,760
the number of issues by assignee the top

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:50,110
two I believe was the same the last one

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,050
L&L seven was the same but in the middle

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,269
there were some changes some places

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,140
switched but pretty much mirrors

00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:03,430
everything it's only on one year more

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:07,870
than the stats for last year so there's

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:09,850
no surprise there and I compared the

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,310
stats from last year that's why I

00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:17,820
started with a bit of the video instead

00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:23,019
of the head of this new presentation and

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:25,440
about pretty much every stats here is

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:28,750
the same except the maximum duration

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,900
there was a new issue I didn't have time

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,140
to look up what was the issue but if not

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,590
if I think someone here knows because of

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,590
the rafter

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:47,420
but something was open for a while and

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:50,110
then was closed and this is the issues

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,110
open per day

00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,280
we don't have the red lines for the

00:03:53,660 --> 00:04:03,940
Israelis the tool that generates this

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:06,770
takes a while to run on this laptop and

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,810
the data collection takes days but the

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:12,230
tool to run only the ipython notebooks

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,150
about 30 minutes on this laptop so I

00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,970
couldn't update it with the red lines

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:24,169
for the new releases but they're about

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:27,380
there and yeah about there so strangely

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:29,990
there's a bump for new inches open

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,400
before between the two releases but

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:38,150
nothing really remarkable for the

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,979
releases and if we look back here for

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:42,979
the ratios open by day there's this bike

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:47,710
that was pointed out last year that's

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:53,650
the next wiki move which was closed

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:53,650
around there skewing the graphs

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,199
[Music]

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:07,560
this is pretty much the same that the

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:10,650
others sadly I had trouble getting the

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,010
data for the pull requests in the same

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:16,230
format what used in the last year so I

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,080
don't have those stats this is why it's

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:22,350
only the issues that I'll be looking

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,600
maybe into generating those later then

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:33,380
put them online but sorry about that and

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:35,310
I'm going to talk about the next subject

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,780
yeah we can

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:42,180
yeah maybe on the graph we still are

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,110
opening more issues than we are closing

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,240
all the time like we are above the zero

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,770
forever so that's it's about the same

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,440
for the pull request though yeah so

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,740
that's well might be considered a

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,169
problem but yeah well I think it's I

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,010
personally think it's pretty common in

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:09,690
large larger distributions to have lots

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:13,590
of unsolved issues that somehow aren't

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:21,840
that much important for people to spend

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:24,919
lots of time on all right so that were

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,110
some statistics

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:37,320
now maybe well I'll say something about

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:39,960
the releases themselves well in the

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:44,850
unlikely case that you didn't know we

00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:49,050
have a well the main development process

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:52,260
is a kind of rolling style compared to

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,860
some other distributions and that's not

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:58,460
really suitable for everyone so every

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:05,419
half a year now we are doing

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:10,909
stabler releases which are supposed

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:15,080
not to break things match either by just

00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:18,499
real box or just by the fact that the

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:22,849
that something changes that you don't

00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:27,369
expect not really being bad for anything

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:31,099
so right now the the cycle has

00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:39,979
stabilized on every half a year we fork

00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:43,699
off the master branch we we test we have

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:46,639
some period where we don't do any large

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,119
changes to it for one month and then

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:56,539
that when it looks good it gets like

00:07:50,119 --> 00:08:03,379
officially blessed as suitable for usage

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:19,749
and and that gets maintained for for the

00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:19,749
half a year right so for that I'll

00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:29,619
quickly say what kind of changes are

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:32,810
expected to get into this releases it

00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:37,360
it's the the main focus of these

00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:41,709
releases were for like like for

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,560
production environments for example and

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:48,019
similar ones where you mainly need

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:53,319
security fixes so that's the main thing

00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:57,560
to put these back ports in there and

00:08:53,319 --> 00:09:00,910
many upstream packages provide some kind

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:06,079
of stability updates stable updates so

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:10,069
so for example Linux kernel so these are

00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:13,519
also the main things that can get in

00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:16,540
there though maybe not as important as

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,540
the security fixes

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,209
yeah well and well for some software

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,889
like browsers it's basically every

00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:34,730
release is security released so that's

00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:38,990
that's always put in there typically so

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:51,410
there might be some confusion about who

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:57,529
actually does the things so right now

00:09:51,410 --> 00:10:03,220
the workflow was that that people who do

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:06,499
the changes to the main branches are or

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:11,360
the people who merge them are expected

00:10:06,499 --> 00:10:15,170
to usually notice that these kind of

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:19,970
changes for example fix security bugs or

00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:27,670
something like that and we would like

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:31,160
them to either notify us but the best to

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:37,790
create backporting pull request or

00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:40,279
backport the changes directly anybody

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:43,970
can do a back port you don't need to be

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:46,850
a committer everyone can do one back

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,579
port so if you open a PR you don't have

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,370
commit bits it's not important you know

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:56,420
that this PR is going to be back ported

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:58,339
since it's either a we had this that

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,470
showed up quickly these are their

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,620
current the current rough guidelines for

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,209
back porting and they are linked in RFC

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,319
does currently work in progress we're

00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:15,410
going to touch about it RFC and later on

00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:18,100
but those if anything matches this it's

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,360
a candidate for a back part

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,449
forget about that that's not right

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,750
anymore there's a darwin stable branch

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:29,060
now but it's mostly the security

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,920
sensitive stuff that's

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,500
those are important even if it's a

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,820
breaking update for that software like

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,820
Chrome if

00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,970
if Chrome gets updated you

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,269
okay we riding the you don't back port

00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:56,139
okay don't look at the don't look behind

00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:59,110
the curtain so the security stuff like

00:11:56,139 --> 00:12:02,399
the chromium chrome that's extremely

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,779
important since that's a big security

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:10,209
sorry a big surface of attack and

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:13,269
there's sorry I'm going to need to rate

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:17,110
to be about say there is a bug fixes in

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:19,540
applications sometimes they some

00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:22,740
software gets updated by the other

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:25,839
distros like debian fedora for their

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:30,490
stable branches that's a good place to

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:32,709
check for for patches that fixes the

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,819
issues that major updates would have

00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:41,800
fixed but we can't really back port

00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:44,350
filling that if the software is not if

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,990
it's like a leaf from the dependences

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:51,639
dependency tree sometimes it's right to

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:54,429
update with major versions especially

00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:57,370
for services for things that depends on

00:12:54,429 --> 00:13:01,089
services like Spotify if the service

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:04,480
changes we can't just tell you our users

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:07,329
well what if I changed we can't that's

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,439
not a good UX so software that depends

00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:14,860
on other services like those

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:17,910
cryptocurrencies there's a the well

00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:22,040
Spotify is the prime example

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,040
now back to who

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:36,710
ah right so yeah well there's the the

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,750
RFC in progress so right now it's

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:44,440
everyone because there's really the

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:48,470
speed of inflow of pull requests and and

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:52,880
or changes directly to master is really

00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:55,730
huge so that couldn't even two people

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,060
couldn't really manage to watch all of

00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:10,430
those changes and decide whether they

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:14,300
are suitable right while for the like in

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:17,330
in several months there will be another

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:22,600
cycle release cycle beginning and we

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:30,920
don't really know who will the next

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:33,800
release manager be well like the the

00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,580
approach now is that the there are

00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:43,370
always two managers at once being

00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:46,880
replaced in even out fashion right so I

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:53,500
will be living for the next next one and

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:59,960
we are about to choose my replacement

00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:04,970
and so so you can think about this

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:11,180
whether you would like to do organize it

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:12,900
and if you are interesting write us an

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,320
email

00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:20,400
and even if you think you can't do it

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,850
for any reason even if you have any

00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,040
interest ask us we will be able to talk

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,410
maybe you can do it probably you can do

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,810
it I thought I couldn't do it I did do

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:36,089
it and everything went fine since it's

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:38,940
like said senior junior I was out along

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:41,010
the way by mostly Vladimir but also the

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,070
other previous realize managers the

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,850
community was I don't have a list of

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:51,930
names since I would pretty much least

00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:53,910
half of the committers since well active

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,180
committers since everything everyone was

00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,420
I

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,100
there's nothing to say how about that so

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,750
even if you think you can do it

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,600
contact us and we're not only looking

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:13,140
for 18:03 since well normally we will we

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,220
should have add a release manager at the

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,630
end of 80 note or at the end of 1803 the

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:24,350
release manager should have already been

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:27,720
selected it was said I was asked in

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:31,650
August so already there was a bit of a

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:37,020
gap and we I don't want this to happen

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:38,970
again so show yourself for 1903 and if

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,120
you have questions or maybe you think

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:46,140
19:03 you can do it but you know you

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:49,790
have the time for 1910 also show

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,790
yourself so we know who's interested

00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,290
well I don't think we have anything else

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,050
there do you have any questions well

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:10,160
maybe we need

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:10,160
[Applause]

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:23,940
so not a question but an amendment if

00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:26,610
you merge super requests on github and

00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:28,980
you don't know whether you should pack

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:31,320
pot but what I usually do is also as

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,730
just ask the user that brought up the

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
back part because they know the software

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,570
usually they have a motivation where the

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,430
Mitsos up great and they also might know

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,980
if it affects your current stable branch

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:45,380
because not all updates or all fixes are

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,380
also relevant for the back port case

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:58,500
that wasn't a question but that's nice

00:17:52,130 --> 00:18:00,810
do you have an instruction so I often up

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,030
until now at least back for either new

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:06,120
packages or updates under new attributes

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,530
is that okay or I just like it because

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,570
it means I don't have to change

00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,950
everything I can just change that I know

00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,710
I could use overlays and maybe I should

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,350
but I'm just what's your thoughts on

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,260
should we do it at on new packages or

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:24,660
what or a major update offender a new

00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:27,150
attribute under a new tribute yes right

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,130
now we don't have any better back board

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:33,090
guidelines than what was written there

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:35,850
but the idea is from stable to stable

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,340
you shouldn't have to change anything so

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:41,220
if you use a new attribute to backport

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,700
something that new attribute has to be

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,870
in this table but is that right I'm I

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,970
don't know I guess that's my question as

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:59,340
release manager do you want us to be

00:18:50,970 --> 00:19:01,950
doing that or not well I think these

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,290
kind of changes are very unlikely to

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:12,000
break anyone's system so that does seem

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:14,520
alright so yeah it's a it's a bit the

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,800
rules are overall bit hazy just we are

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:21,810
creating them as we go it's okay do we

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:28,890
have another questions and where from

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:31,670
anyone nope okay then once again thank

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,670
you guys for your talk

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,600
I was I was checking the I was checking

00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,480
the time hey we're wondering what's up

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,400
next and I'm happy to say that what's up

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,780
next is you feeling your body with

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,110
coffee because we've got a 30-minute

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,110
