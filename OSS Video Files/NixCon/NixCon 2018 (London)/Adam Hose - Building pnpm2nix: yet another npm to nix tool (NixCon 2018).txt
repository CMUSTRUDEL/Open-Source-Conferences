Publication date: 2018-11-06
Playlist: NixCon 2018 (London)
Description: 
	There are already plenty of node package managers so why yet another one? This talk aims to give you an overview of the current npm-to-nix ecosystem, what tools there are, what the strengths/shortcomings of each one have and what pnpm is all about and how it pertains to nix. After that I will be talking you through what goes in to building pnpm2nix, what problems I had along the way and how nix/nixpkgs could improve to help such efforts along. --- Bio: I love building software
