Title: Christian Kauhaus - Migrating a Hosting Infrastructure from Gentoo (NixCon 2018)
Publication date: 2018-10-27
Playlist: NixCon 2018 (London)
Description: 
	I would like to share our experiences while migrating a VM-based hosting infrastructure at Flying Circus Internet Operations from Gentoo to NixOS. It is a case study of migrating 500+ VM running diverse customer projects using a wide range of web technologies.

I'll cover the following main points:

1. What was our motivation to change to NixOS? Which specific features of NixOS attracted us?

2. Creating a NixOS-based hosting platform - What did we have to implement? What is still missing?

3. What are the pain points? How could NixOS become more attractive?

4. What do our users think? -- benefits and stumbling blocks.
