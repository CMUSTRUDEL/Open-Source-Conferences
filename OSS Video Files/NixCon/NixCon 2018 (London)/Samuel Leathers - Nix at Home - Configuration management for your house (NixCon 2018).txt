Title: Samuel Leathers - Nix at Home - Configuration management for your house (NixCon 2018)
Publication date: 2018-10-27
Playlist: NixCon 2018 (London)
Description: 
	My talk I'm proposing is on how to use nix at home in a variety of different ways. We'll start with the basics, a single git repository with multiple machine configurations cloned to /etc/nixos. From there we'll talk about how to deploy machines using nixops with the none backend, specifically in the context of a home router machine with multiple interfaces running all the basic services needed for a secure usable home network. From their we'll foray into how nixos generations works under the hood a bit and talk about IOHK's work at making a remote deployable mac system using nix-darwin, as well as some custom code I wrote that allows you to run nix systemd services (example being prometheus node exporter) on any linux system. We'll wrap the talk up with some discussion about using nix for home automation and monitoring as well as a chance for Q&A. --- Bio: I've been involved with the nix community for a little over a year. I help out on IRC whenever I have a chance (disasm). I work on the devops team of IOHK using nix and haskell on a daily basis. I've been using nixops to deploy my main home router for a little over 6 months, and have been using custom haskell to deploy my mac systems using nix-darwin for about 3 months.
