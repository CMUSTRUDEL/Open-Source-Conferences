Title: Managing Python Environments with pypi2nix by Sebastian Jordan (NixCon 2017)
Publication date: 2017-10-31
Playlist: NixCon 2017 (Munich)
Description: 
	This talk wants to give an overview over the usage and development of pypi2nix, a tool to generate and maintain python environments with nix.

pypi2nix is already a viable tool to generate and manage python environments with their respective dependencies inside of nix. The first part of this talk will be focused on the current functionality of it. This includes features and shortcomings. The second part of the talk is about nixpkgs-python and how we use pypi2nix to maintain semi-automated self-updating sets of python packages. Finally we will discuss how pypi2nix could be used to maintain python package sets inside of nixpkgs in the future.
