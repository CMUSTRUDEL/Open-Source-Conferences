Title: Nix flakes (NixCon 2019)
Publication date: 2019-10-28
Playlist: NixCon 2019 (Brno)
Description: 
	This talk will give an overview of Nix flakes, a proposed mechanism to package Nix expressions into composable entities ("flakes"). Flakes allow hermetic, reproducible evaluation of multi-repository Nix projects; impose a discoverable, standard structure on Nix projects; and replace previous mechanisms such as Nix channels and the Nix search path. This talk will discuss the current state of the flakes project and possible future developments.
