Title: The dark and murky past of NixOS (NixCon 2019)
Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: NixCon 2019 (Brno)
Description: 
	NixOS hasn't always been there, but it was created by a small team 15 years ago. In this talk you will learn how NixOS got started (and what came before), why certain design decisions that are still in NixOS today were made, and perhaps see an embarassing picture or two.

	00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:44,589
so the next talk is going to be about

00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:48,039
dark and murky paths of mixes so it's me

00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:49,719
again so before we start I first want to

00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,519
announce a little bit of a contest the

00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,670
first person to actually package this

00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:57,820
this thing into next packages will win

00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,579
this very hard ugly hard plastic msn

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,289
figurine actually doesn't no longer

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:04,350
works on Amazon because Amazon is no

00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:08,440
longer working but it does work on Linux

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:10,960
so get cracking so when if you were

00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,340
thinking about adding support for this

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,060
to Hydra

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,429
that's even better so because you know

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,840
it actually has little LEDs and can flap

00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:21,610
its wings and all that that's really

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
cool so if you want to want to be woken

00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:27,429
up in the middle of the night because

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,340
you're built filled it's perfect so I

00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:33,100
got some more of them so I'm going to

00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,500
talk about the history of Nix OS and

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,390
this is not necessarily the real history

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:39,460
so some of the facts might have been

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:43,210
changed for a dramatic effect but who

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,860
cares so it's all in the past anyway so

00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,509
a little bit about me I actually started

00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,409
computer science at its after university

00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:54,009
together with Elko and Rob and my master

00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:57,130
thesis was Nicolas so I created the very

00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:59,520
first Nix OS so it's because of me that

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,200
you are here

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,929
[Applause]

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,539
so it would have happened one way or

00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:11,480
another anyway but I just accelerated it

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:13,610
so after that I drifted away to do other

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,349
things mostly first system

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,140
administration I used to be in the board

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:21,260
of NL ug formerly known as the Dutch

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,750
UNIX user group and then I drew I got

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,910
more into legal and licensing so I was

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,900
on the core team of GPL violations Doric

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,810
for about seven years

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,700
and now I'm having my own consultancy

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,190
focusing on open source license

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,319
compliance software provenance and so on

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,930
so things about reproducible builds

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,629
where software is coming from is still

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,920
very important in my day to day job

00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,170
because when I actually have to go to

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,120
court and then show like oh well this is

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:51,049
where this particular software came from

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,700
then knowing exactly where it came from

00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:59,209
how it was built is actually very very

00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:02,060
important to me so about me so I started

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:06,799
using Linux an open source somewhere in

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:08,959
1994 first FreeBSD and then later we

00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,630
switched at home we switched to two to

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,930
Linux in 1995 Slackware and that was

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:18,230
before Windows 95 was released so I only

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,739
started using Windows 95 or 98 when it

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,919
was already a few years old so in 1996 I

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:27,079
started studying at a university so ilka

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,450
was actually the one of the first other

00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,359
students that I even talked to when so

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:36,349
on the first day so we've known each

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:38,359
other for quite a long time so I already

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,269
had some experience with Linux FreeBSD

00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:44,090
and then we got hp-ux and IREX

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:48,980
yeah I can tell you it's nothing like in

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:50,840
Jurassic Park but so and then Solaris a

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,180
year later and although I've used Linux

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,880
exclusively for a very long time I've

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,980
always been a bit of a you know a BSD

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,069
fanboy and I have proof so that's

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,810
actually Kirk McKusick so an old UNIX

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,540
guys super nice guy if you ever meet

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,690
meet him in a conference just go talk to

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,000
him and see he knows a lot of stuff

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,870
about the history of UNIX and he's done

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,389
so much that's unbelievable

00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,010
anyway there were some frustrations so

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,799
some friends actually studied physics

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:24,449
and they got really deep into Debian and

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,300
I was using HP of xix

00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:31,449
another Linux and FreeBSD at home and

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,130
then whenever I said you know this

00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,930
problem how should I and then their

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,139
default answer would be up get install

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,479
that really turned me off so that's like

00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,639
come on it so every conversation and

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:48,880
that with apt-get installs like okay bye

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:50,229
and that just us like it's if they

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,120
wouldn't have done that I might have

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,740
been using Debian but that was like okay

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,300
this is not for me if this is your

00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,120
attitude then this is not for me

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,860
all right so through a friend I got

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,870
involved in Rock Linux I'm not sure if

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,530
anyone here has ever heard of Rock Linux

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:08,979
and they home one person it was a long

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,070
time ago so and I especially worked on

00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,699
the ultrasparc port because admittedly

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,889
it was also a bit of a Sun fanboy but

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,100
that distribution was a built from

00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:24,940
source thing much like Gen 2 but then a

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:29,229
little bit before gentle and maybe not

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,000
as polished as gen 2 but it what

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,740
attracted me is what it was kind of

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,690
influenced by the freebsd port system

00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,970
that I really liked and in the end it

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,099
wasn't a very successful project gent

00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,860
who took their entire market basically

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,380
overnight and I just ended up installing

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:52,330
Red Hat Linux and later Fedora core and

00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:55,960
have stayed with that for ever since so

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,930
around 2002 I took over the management

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,050
or maybe the mismanagement of a student

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,460
lap at the University and I also got

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,320
very interested in things like

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,539
portability because of my experience

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,960
with other operating systems and other

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:13,570
architectures as well so one day a very

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,940
big pile of old PCs became available and

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:19,030
we decided like ok well these are going

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,729
to be trashed anyway so why don't we do

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,849
anything with it so we will I just hold

00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:26,740
them to the lab we stack them up we

00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:27,460
install different operating systems on

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,810
it

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,789
we started to play with built form

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,910
software so December built form

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:35,440
tinderbox also some build firm software

00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,150
from the University of Amsterdam and

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,729
I've forgotten the name I don't even

00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:43,389
know no longer know do you still know

00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:46,300
what it L Co forgot to and one test case

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,880
for us was the strategist at ego xt

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,580
program transformation tool so that

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,979
looked a little bit like that so the

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,569
person on the right is actually martin

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,550
who was the number three I think the

00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:01,840
number three committed to Nix packages

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,960
so he hasn't done anything for over a

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,150
decade I think but he can still be found

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,449
somewhere in the in the log so it's a

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:13,360
lot of beige lots of Dell taking up a

00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:17,440
lot of space as well but this is what we

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,930
what we did is we played around and what

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,909
we found is that the built form software

00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,569
was suboptimal at best

00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:27,669
so some builds would sometimes fill

00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,490
because I did an update of the base

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,560
system so some bills they would run

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,050
perfectly then it's like okay there's a

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,580
security update I would just install the

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,430
security update and then the build would

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,150
fill and debugging that would just be so

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,740
incredibly hard so basically we took the

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,780
approach like okay well you know you

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,550
don't touch it or it will break of

00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,110
course these machines were connected to

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,690
the internet so that's not a not a good

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,669
idea but it was a very useful learning

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,099
experience for us I wrote a paper about

00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:00,960
that that you can still find I presented

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:04,210
it at the UK ug Linux conference in 2003

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,710
so was an Edinburgh was very nice in

00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,190
summer just at the start of the Fringe

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,830
Festival so I got lucky

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:15,370
so around this time Elko had already

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:18,159
started working on on Nix and one of the

00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,219
first use cases being release management

00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:24,479
for again Stratego XT and I have proof

00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:27,030
for that so this is from a old

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,979
conference where it actually says

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:34,690
release management for strategist at

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:36,310
Eagle XT with Nix see I didn't lie where

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,560
he's also talking about stuff that I

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,490
don't even understand like what did it

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,500
suffer deployment as a memory management

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,110
and I think that's in your in your

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,640
thesis right so if you really want to

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:51,950
know about what is all means just

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,110
readest visas so of course there was are

00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,709
already something before Nick's it was

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,720
called Mac so that software never saw an

00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:02,300
official release but at one point it did

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,970
have a wikipedia page page so I think

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,360
it's probably been deleted a long time

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:11,000
ago and a little known fact by Madonna

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,250
from vim fame he was also working on a

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,890
release tool called app which was

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:19,399
sponsored by a Nelnet there they Oregon

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,649
and one thing is that I basically I

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,750
connected bummed whom I happen to know

00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,899
at a time in Elko and they just spent a

00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:29,270
day talking about I don't even know what

00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:34,100
you talked about probably about ideas

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:36,200
about the different systems you probably

00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:45,399
know a lot more about that or might you

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:45,399
might have forgotten mostly forgotten so

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:53,029
when I was looking for an a project for

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,190
my master thesis I tried some and failed

00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,360
and basically I was looking for

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,440
something like okay but you know I

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,329
really have to finish studying so what

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,490
they actually said as well why don't you

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,940
try to build a complete Linux

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,370
distribution with Nix and back then

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,980
already some work had been done by Elko

00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,870
called Nix Nix you which was a quite

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,050
minimal user mode Linux based

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,510
distribution so it wasn't the kernel was

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,149
basically some usual land tools that

00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,649
were working so Nick so the soda was

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,120
actually something before Nick's OS

00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,130
called Nick's you I think you can still

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,250
find it in the indie repositories I

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,070
wouldn't recommend trying it but it's

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,020
still there but my goal was to go all

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,750
the way and actually install it onto

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,850
real Hardware just to make sure like

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,680
okay can we do this will this actually

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,680
work because at that time we didn't know

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:52,400
so I took Nick's you I expanded on it

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,140
because I'm quite a stubborn person I

00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:58,160
try to build things on my

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,960
Recor and elko was using Susan and yep

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,680
well you know they say you know Linux

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,570
standard base well my ass like no way

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,570
there were so many differences between

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,390
those two distributions that it was just

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:13,400
painful so one of the things was with

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,460
the C library I think with the M PTL

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,070
threading library that was just a ton of

00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:22,130
pain so Fedora took a much different

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:25,430
approach to that then Sousa did and that

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,980
this caused lots of troubles so in the

00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,440
end I convinced Elko that this was a

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,840
problem and then he introduced a

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,390
statically built environments and I

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:38,030
think that that is still more or less in

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,520
Nix today but not in the way we actually

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,680
made it so my main contribution there

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,200
was just a moan a lot so ilka would film

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,970
would actually attack this problem and

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,860
that's usually a very good strategy when

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,340
when dealing with ill go you're just

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:56,180
you're just it takes some time but

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,730
then it just fixes it like that so I

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:01,220
actually added quite a few of the tools

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,290
there and then I added most of them I

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,160
did the static builds I added them to

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,320
the subversion repository and so on and

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,840
after that we just started hacking so

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,520
this is a very early engineering note I

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,280
still don't know what Elka was trying to

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,360
say here but I think it was a little bit

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,360
about how the store worked

00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:27,290
you really have to improve your

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:29,840
handwriting so after adding enough of

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,900
the essential tools we actually got got

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,480
it to work and got it transferred to to

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:39,380
some real hardware so both virtual and

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,600
real sophia we had some vmware virtual

00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,970
machines and we also installed it on a

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,700
real PC and we were just happily playing

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,700
around with it and then we thought we

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:53,660
were toying around and then all of a

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:57,410
sudden we realized like okay well we

00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,660
forgot to create the bin SH sibling but

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,580
most of the tools worked so at that time

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,770
we knew like okay well a lot of the

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,890
programs out there actually do not

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,710
depend on bin as H being present in the

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:11,340
system and they will

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,200
just work fine without them so Linux

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,140
standards base you don't actually don't

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,180
need it at least for most programs you

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,280
actually don't need it so at that point

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,030
we knew that this would work and it gave

00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,890
to the project a major boost and that

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:30,420
made Elko very happy as I can show you

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:34,110
here now where is this is this is the

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,600
worst photo that's in there but can you

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:45,930
see the green stuff there

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:48,570
D'Souza DVDs it exposed so when we

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:50,310
installed a new build firm with two main

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:55,290
machines called itchy and scratchy and

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:57,540
also whole other whole another pile of

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,020
machines so we were indefinitely into

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,280
the Simpsons as you can tell so and

00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,440
eventually those two machines were

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,780
completely reinstalled with Nix who has

00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,610
very early on and was just a little bit

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,260
hesitant but just yoga just said yeah we

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,240
like we're just going to install next

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,190
weather night and just use it on those

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,080
machines and that worked really well and

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,340
I think those machines ran for how long

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:24,870
for four or five years quite a long time

00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:28,800
doing lots and lots of builds so it was

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:31,320
like this a little bit at tidier as you

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,390
can see so the two main built machines

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,280
were up there and the other ones were

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,880
just all kinds of other machines that we

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,500
installed with various operating systems

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,390
but eventually those were all scrapped

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,910
and I think that we only use the two

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:50,820
upper machines so I did some more work

00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,800
on onyx West and I actually made

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,600
installation cities which I then

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,600
installed on some of the machines that I

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,440
did I showed to you and I also tried to

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,290
do some cross compilation I had some old

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,260
Java stations actually and with spark

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:11,430
processor and what I try to do is to

00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:14,430
create a cross compilation environment

00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,440
with GCC and that turned out to be

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:18,870
incredibly hard I still don't know why

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,970
so these days it's a lot better but at

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,570
that top that point in time it was just

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,430
impulse

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,000
the hard to do I don't know why

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:31,770
something with the include paths or that

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,520
it would have something like DD it would

00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,500
try to invoke a previously built

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,560
compiler for the wrong platform or

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:46,410
something and libraries in big mass so

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,380
after that I moved away from Nick's Wes

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,180
but I still kept contributing to a few

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,850
packages for a few years but I don't

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,520
think that there's much that survives to

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,350
this day maybe a few brackets here and

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,020
there that you can still find when using

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,270
git blame but you know I still have some

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,720
of the pictures we basically says no

00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,720
pictures

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:15,490
so one thing that I can do is actually

00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:18,500
so Elka dug up a old boot session a

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:23,480
movie with an old boot session of Nix OS

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:25,310
in June 2005 so it's June 2005 so if you

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,209
want to see that it's very very

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,209
bare-bones myth

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,780
so I think this is actually OCO typing

00:16:51,230 --> 00:17:00,860
but yeah so it was this was this was

00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:04,690
very very rough not a lot of automation

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,690
going on at that point

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,160
not sure what alga was typing so slow

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,559
so one thing that you will notice is at

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,870
this point we didn't actually yet

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,450
correctly set the path because it said

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:49,000
command not found found for LS so we

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:57,429
used echo which was a dirty hack but it

00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:00,309
works so I think so in case you ever

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:05,950
wipe your in case you ever wipe your

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:08,740
environment in case you ever wipe your

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,450
environment that's actually good hack so

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:16,779
we didn't didn't actually set the path

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:20,309
back then I think we were just a few

00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,309
months in here at this point

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,100
so just so you know wildcards they don't

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,100
work

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:55,230
now instead so I think this was this was

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,230
definitely Elko typing

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:11,980
we eventually we could be cut there we

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,980
just had to find the right derivation

00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:41,130
[Applause]

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:43,850
now that was very old school old school

00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,850
next to us

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,679
so I think that's the that's the end

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:11,570
all right so to wrap up so technically I

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,340
started next to us but since then it is

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,190
because of you that it has grown so much

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,200
so I want to I actually want to thank

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:22,180
you for putting so much work into it and

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:28,799
making it a lot lot better so thank you

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:28,799
[Applause]

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,009
also of course we might have some time

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:46,610
for some more embarrassing stories if

00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:52,039
anyone went see her why did you move

00:20:46,610 --> 00:21:00,830
away from NYX well I got a job I got a

00:20:52,039 --> 00:21:03,049
job in that didn't involve NYX OS and at

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,539
that point it was very very getting very

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,190
deeply into the licensing stuff so I

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:09,200
basically didn't have any free time left

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,879
at all to tinker things but they're

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:17,769
still updated a few packages here and

00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:17,769
there any other questions

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm curious about this idea of running

00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:34,390
the activation script from Grubb while

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,039
you're booting if that was an idea you

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:40,000
had from the beginning or something you

00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:42,450
came up with along the way this was 14

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,640
years ago I honestly don't remember I

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:50,309
just needed to get stuff stuff done so I

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,309
really don't remember very nothing

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:59,529
are you using next to us again now so if

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,210
you actually saw my talk from yesterday

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:07,960
no I'm so right now I'm still on fedora

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:09,940
and that's so some people are trying to

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,240
convince me to go back to NYX Wes so rob

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,980
already trying to to install it while

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,890
we're driving here I just said well he

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,240
said well yeah just give me the laptop I

00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,299
won't start now I just said keep your

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,730
eyes on the road it would be well better

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,649
but so yeah I should go back into it but

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,630
first I have to finish a few other

00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:33,730
things first need to get some clients

00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:36,309
off my back and who was the first other

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,909
person you convinced to install mixers

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,559
other than YouTube oh actually in our

00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:44,320
lab there were quite a few people like a

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:48,460
few people quite eager to install it so

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,740
I think some Martin Lewis who was there

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,179
was so as the number-three committer was

00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,130
also very interested and a few other

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:57,520
people in the lab as well and I'm not

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,750
sure how it actually spread do you do

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,980
you still know how it I was actually

00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:04,510
spread outside of our lab what was it

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:08,159
was it through there probably through

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,159
Haskell or some Haskell people I think

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:17,649
very early contributors like Ludovic who

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:21,520
starts at geeks don't know when he

00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:23,620
showed up 2007 or so were a few people

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,289
already using it before but I think the

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,480
mostly some some of the Haskell people

00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:32,010
at the University they started to get

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,010
into it and probably spread the word

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,080
yeah it so on the gate logs

00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,870
I don't know remember these things

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,190
because they're in the logs so as soon

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,650
as I started using it it started

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,400
contributing so then we can find out how

00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,400
it actually went

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,990
I was wondering if you can recall

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:05,980
anything from your thesis defense like

00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:10,230
it was not a PhD thesis but it was just

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:13,830
a master thesis so I remember basically

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:17,800
them saying that it was good enough so I

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:19,450
was a that was a good moment so no no I

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,130
actually died so that was just a few

00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,530
people there's like a supervisor

00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,480
Elco and I had a bunch of others so no

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:35,020
external people so now I don't really

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:37,180
recall anything oh well first of all I

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,340
mentioned that the thesis defense was

00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,160
one week before the 10-year deadline

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,670
that you had to reach and at once to not

00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,530
have to pay back your entire student so

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,720
a little bit of history about that so

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:52,570
when we started we actually got student

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,950
loans and the period to finish it was

00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:56,680
ten years and I finished in nine years

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,450
and 51 days 51 weeks sorry

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,160
51 weeks so I had one week left and the

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:02,350
other thing is that you were wearing a

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,180
sick of it old t-shirt that was the

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:08,620
right yep

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:15,850
but there was just coincidence because

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:20,770
now that I accept that that was not an

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:24,130
honest that means that was oh I was

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:27,940
wearing that I think but that wasn't a

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:30,060
conscious decision it's just a band you

00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,060
know

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:51,430
hey what did Nexus configuration look

00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:51,430
like before module system was introduced

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,680
what did it look like

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,230
configuration came later I like that

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,110
answer yeah but so basically it was very

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,270
bare-bones just what what you saw that

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,370
was it what that is what it was like in

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:12,110
the early beginning just finding the

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,570
right paths in the store and then just

00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:16,930
doing some stuff so it was really just a

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,930
proof-of-concept

00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,820
there's some really cool masters and PhD

00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,580
theses that he had over there are there

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:33,830
any any other theses from from your

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,919
department that you remember that were

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,309
that are interesting in some way to you

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,309
personally

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,630
so you actually expected me to have read

00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:52,100
those Jesus so no no sorry I wasn't into

00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:55,039
that I was just I was just glad that I

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,440
had finished everything I probably

00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,039
wasn't the right person to have an

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,039
academic career

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,970
have you had anything interesting in the

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,970
lower level like you know kernel-space

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,490
with people I only had a male vm gallo

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:27,530
our thing is works with NYX but I've had

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:29,480
anything else in this space you will

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,320
have to repeat that question you know

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,460
kernels unique kernels with the question

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,260
so don't the only thing that I actually

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:41,590
focused on was just getting Linux to

00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:41,590
work okay so that is all I ever tried

00:27:50,830 --> 00:28:04,710
did you consider making it worth FreeBSD

00:27:53,980 --> 00:28:07,090
instead no fanboy enough so why not I

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:11,280
already had done it for Linux and I

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:14,020
think that that with FreeBSD the whole

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,670
kernel and user space was much more

00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,470
tightly integrated so it would have been

00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:22,300
been a lot more difficult with Linux

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,680
things were much more componentized so

00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,680
that would actually have been easier

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,920
sometimes when packaging packages fonox

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,510
packages we have some questions about

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,110
licensing what we can include how we can

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:43,840
link and so on would you be willing to

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:47,350
help answer those questions so we have

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,180
another week right so no it's our so

00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,980
they're there so of course I'm not I'm

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,390
not a lawyer so I can actually not give

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,880
legal advice especially in certain

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:58,360
jurisdictions I'm not allowed to do that

00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,690
but I do have thoughts about them that

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,240
is as far as I can go but yeah so a

00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:10,060
licensing and nix packages that's

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,650
something that could be improved let me

00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,330
just say that that I think that there's

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,340
there's a lot of stuff that can be

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,290
improved there so if anyone is

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,310
interested in tackling that problem I

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,310
would be more than happy to help

00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:35,920
alright so did any anyone's managed to

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:38,020
package it no one really so I will be

00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,850
here all afternoon so if you just have

00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,220
pen package didn't buy then then you can

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,050
just come and pick it up so if there are

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,580
no more questions I'd like to thank you

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:55,230
for your time and attention

00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:55,230
[Applause]

00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:59,210
