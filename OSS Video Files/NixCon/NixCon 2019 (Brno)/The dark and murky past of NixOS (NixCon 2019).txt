Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: NixCon 2019 (Brno)
Description: 
	NixOS hasn't always been there, but it was created by a small team 15 years ago. In this talk you will learn how NixOS got started (and what came before), why certain design decisions that are still in NixOS today were made, and perhaps see an embarassing picture or two.
