or silence and your full attention and

00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,180
hi so I I'm Samuel D our simulated

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,549
general here you might more recognize

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:19,789
this avatar than my name I hope maybe

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,789
not and I work on mobile Nexus

00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:27,060
what's mobile next OS Mobile UNIX OS is

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,640
a Linux distribution normal Linux

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,669
distribution for your phone well some

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,650
conditions may apply with the goals are

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,920
with integrating and it erogenous

00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,520
ecosystem which means different kind of

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,950
phones different line age of phones and

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,170
all of this in one repository and its

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,410
goal or so is to make full use of the

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:57,540
hardware this means calling SMS data

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,890
acceleration everything since if you

00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,500
can't call from your phone it's not a

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,480
phone it's just a screen and then if you

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,439
can't use the internet from your screen

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:13,160
it's just a user screen then it should

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:15,870
work like mix OS and work with next OS I

00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,270
think it's easier to start with some

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,980
things that I don't aim to do right now

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,130
or maybe not ever

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,870
under the project name like I don't want

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,930
to prescribe any kind of graphical

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,940
environment so just like with mixed OS

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,100
you're free to choose whatever you want

00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:35,340
to run as long as it's packaged and if

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,070
it's not then can contribute I don't

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,159
intend to make it particularly easy to

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,800
run Android apps but it's just something

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,010
that we don't via software since there's

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:51,600
projects like n box that already do this

00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:53,760
then porting devices to mainline index I

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,790
know it's not nice to say that I don't

00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,650
have a goal to port devices to mainline

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,330
UNIX but it's mobile next OS that

00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,130
doesn't have this goal because I think

00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,869
it's a fun side project that's probably

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,950
going to happen for at least those that

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:11,939
I can try it on let's start with some

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,760
history and in June 2018 that's when I

00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:17,110
made the first commit and it's also when

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,160
I announced the project on

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:24,070
discourse in July 2018 I had a second

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,830
device ported this is nice since this

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,960
allowed me to check if there were some

00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,650
bad assumptions in there some but not

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,830
that much

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:39,450
and then from July to November 2018

00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:46,380
I got busy releasing next is the 1809

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:48,670
uncomfortable on post January 31st 2019

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,209
there was a post on the discourse from

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:55,030
Armin

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:58,840
introducing the ng i0 under this the

00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:03,640
post was on this course so I joined

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,750
January 31st I wrote and sent an

00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,620
application for a grant and deadline was

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:14,880
the 1st of February so didn't take that

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:19,840
much time to write up more on that later

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,930
I was selected for second round this is

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,180
good and in March I received some

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,760
questions from in on it turns out my

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,010
application was too narrow in scope they

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,760
wanted me to expand the scope and expand

00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,549
the thus expanding the grant so I did

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,540
then after back and forth the project

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,540
was accepted

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,030
then the more important bit for me it's

00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,130
that in August 2019 I left my job and

00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:01,050
now I'm working full time on mobile next

00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:04,780
is the current state right now we have

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,120
three devices booting although next OS

00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:19,150
and I think I didn't hold power long

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:22,000
enough from the other then I know it's

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,610
just way too small to see well it's just

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,880
for Flair there it is it's booting on

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:32,440
two different devices and those devices

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:35,770
there's the Asus zenfone 2 laser it's

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,280
the one on your left it's much older

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:43,450
than the other devices the zenfone 2

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,169
laser is pretty much in the first or

00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,620
maybe second round of our 64 devices for

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:53,080
Android and the child me redmi note 7 is

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,900
the one on the right which is fun since

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,360
it's pretty new it's it's released I

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,940
think in the beginning of this year so

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,750
this allows me to just check that okay

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:07,150
this works on both all the new hardware

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:09,100
this is just amazing because it works on

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,039
hold and new art where we won't plus one

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,810
plus three I don't have it with me but

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,240
this one was just trivial to port it's

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:19,450
probably about in-between in term of age

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,850
but about three hours since I received

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,610
it in the mail it was already ported and

00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,250
booting just to the same state as you

00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:31,960
can see maybe I hope probably not on

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:34,539
those phone I have no other targets like

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,150
the Asus ct100 this one is interesting

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:41,289
since it's not an Android target this is

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:43,720
a Chrome OS based tablet this allows me

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:46,060
to test whether I made assumptions that

00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,669
were only for entry for Android based

00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:54,789
code for calculus Android devices even

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:57,010
and turns out not much and the target so

00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,380
I've got an example for two different

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,070
kind of targets

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,230
there's the Google Nexus 7 2013 this one

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,410
especially since it's the second device

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,910
i ported it to but it's not a r64 since

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:14,310
it's not not a arch 64 as with standard

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:17,280
next OS since it ends up being a

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,950
standard next OS system once booted

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,050
there's no binary cash so I did not test

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,300
stage 2 yet but I have strong

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,280
assumptions that is going to work once

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,150
I've got a full build of the stage 2

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,340
working not working but building

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,860
motorola said play this one is not

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,930
working entirely but it's you see there

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,370
is a DD after work in progress that's

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,480
because it's my daily driver I can't

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,340
spare the phone for now to test so this

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,430
one is currently yellow but it might

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,460
stay yellow just as the Nexus 7 this is

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:53,910
because Motorola they are not alone in

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:59,100
as OEMs to do this they release and they

00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:03,930
are 64 device with a 32 bits so a-arm v7

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:07,620
l user m so depending on how access to

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,900
art where works like Wi-Fi and maybe not

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,550
Wi-Fi but probably some other hardware

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,610
it might not be possible to run a 64-bit

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,290
system using the proprietary bits let's

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,480
see how it goes then there's the Google

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,610
pixel to excel this one is just working

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,980
progress since I don't have it on hand

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,530
anymore but I was able to get one for a

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,240
couple days and just work and it's

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,590
almost working there's just one little

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,620
bit and might be trivial to fix and aqm

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,410
uvm this one is not a r64 it's used

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,540
mainly to test this system image

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:47,820
generation and check the the graphical

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:51,330
applications since you want you don't

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,640
want to first build for AR 64 and then

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,730
transfer it to your phone and this takes

00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:00,719
quite a while so DBMS for developers to

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:05,429
develop applications so working

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:09,659
currently work in progress meaning hacks

00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:11,339
I'm currently using to make it vote the

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:13,229
kernel is built-in and without module

00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:16,110
support built-in means it's built into

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:18,299
the boot that IMG file that's flashed to

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:22,589
the boot partition more on that and why

00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:24,179
it's on why is an issue soon and without

00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:27,629
module support it's not much of an issue

00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:29,429
it's just more easier to start porting

00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,649
when you don't have to bother with

00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:33,389
module resolution is it loading right

00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:35,659
modules in the state in your custom

00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:38,069
stage one that you currently can't

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:42,120
access via serial since there is no

00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:43,889
serial access on most phones so you

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,019
always boot the current generation

00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:49,470
that's another hack you can't choose the

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,800
generation at boot there's no there's

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,230
nothing

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,779
some of you use you all grub or systemd

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,529
boot or anything as a bootloader it's a

00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:02,610
BL or a boot for the Android devices

00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:06,149
this means that there's no choice 2:44

00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,370
their generation so if you make a small

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,379
accident with your next OS rebuild

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:14,639
switch you might need to reinstall for

00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:17,420
now but that's just for now and there's

00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,550
a limited or Girish report meaning that

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:23,519
there's not much of the hardware working

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:27,269
there's sound lacking which might not be

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,819
much of an issue to fix there's Wi-Fi

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:32,670
networking but everything is known it's

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:36,000
just I'm lacking some I've been lacking

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,920
time to finish working on that there's a

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,860
new GPU acceleration but I've got a

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,720
contribution which might do all that

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:49,639
already and there's no cellular

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,899
communication so no calls no SMS no data

00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,240
and then there is no proper phone

00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:57,990
interface what I mean by that is there

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,709
is no like or foe sure it's just your

00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:03,990
usual x11 desktop which well it's not

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:07,800
made for touch even on a real big screen

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:12,640
like it so it's all room for improvement

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,370
so let's see how I'm going to improve

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,960
I'm going to write documentation I know

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,360
it sounds weird writing documentation

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,870
but it's important so the basic

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,600
structure so you know how everything is

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,760
put together then reporting guide since

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,940
currently the only way it works for

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,740
porting is I try and pour I try to work

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,450
to a new device and I see all right I

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,910
fixed that on the other device by

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:42,670
switching which options and that's not a

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:51,880
great guide a list of devices in this in

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:53,350
their status just for like website

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:57,010
you've got a list of devices and their

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,960
status same thing and a website tying

00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,350
this all together I know this is not the

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,300
fun bit I need to work on enhancing the

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,750
boot process there's a couple of steps

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:11,500
in there first selecting a generation

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,090
this is quite important and inside the

00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,280
adn dd-na

00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:21,100
have mixed OS I probably need to k exact

00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,220
to another kernel since switching kernel

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,140
is not easy and ideally I'd like every

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,200
generation to list which kernel they use

00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:32,220
exactly and treat the boot.img just like

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,540
it was a bootloader then there's a

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,700
strategy for a versatile keyboard during

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,860
stage one that's needed since you don't

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,740
want to break out your full USB keyboard

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,210
and plug-in it plug it in through a USB

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,860
editor to your phone when you're

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,560
rebooting it since it's crash for

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,460
whatever reason maybe not mobile next

00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,110
OSS fault then and then sing the boot

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,840
progress reporting since right now it's

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,330
just an image telling you it's it's

00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,880
stage one and then under image for Stage

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:02,800
two it's probably better if we have some

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,980
output like it's currently doing this

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,920
thing this thing this thing this thing

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:16,560
all work in progress we need to make

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:16,560
more things work Wi-Fi and everything

00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,700
from software this is not about fun

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,010
environments it's about telephony

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,710
software I don't think there is much

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,440
packaging next OS right now so just

00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:32,750
taking time to do this and then about a

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,140
full environment what I mean by that is

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,940
just like they each WM DMS you all know

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:42,860
what this means then I want you to know

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,590
that P he means fall enrollment let's

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,000
continue with questions I already know

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:51,170
you have in your mind and you want to

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,990
ask me what do I need to port what to

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,240
any deport you need first an unlockable

00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,520
bootloader and also to have unlocked

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,420
hero truther it's not enough to just

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,390
have one that unlockable and then kernel

00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,130
sources I did write for SPD port it's

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:10,760
possible without the sources but it's

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:15,590
going to be in hop hill battle how can

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:20,450
you help you can help by porting to new

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:23,000
devices that's like the first wave it's

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:26,120
probably the best way to help since

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,060
there's so many devices and it's so many

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,160
hours in a day then you can test with

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,630
the devices you own if you already own

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,150
one one of the devices listed previously

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,490
or one of the devices that's going to be

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:41,390
listed in the future you can just run it

00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:44,540
hopefully then packaging software this

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:48,440
could be done without even any mobile

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,240
phone with the QM uvm some work on some

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,940
of the parts of the stack most likely

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,160
the phone environment the some of the

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:58,640
software testing that things work as

00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,280
expected this can be done without even

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,900
having a phone that's supported other

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,040
things you can do to help well talk

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,620
about it

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,030
not only talk about mobile in X OS just

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:12,260
forget about it for a moment for one

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:14,780
minute it needs to become ingrained in

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,700
everyone's head maybe not the normal

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,580
people but every gauge that has a phone

00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:22,130
that it shouldn't be a normal to want to

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,270
run another mobile operating system

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,390
I'm not saying necessarily a gnu/linux

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,370
distribution

00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,690
should be normal to even want Windows on

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,630
your phone you probably don't want it

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,400
but it should be normal to want to run

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,440
whatever you want on your phone and this

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,870
is not something that we can fix it's

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,710
something that can be fixed most likely

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,100
by the OEMs

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,750
but even then most likely by the

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:50,520
manufacturers of the CPUs the system on

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:53,870
chips so let's try and make this an

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:57,780
issue that's known and that anyways hi

00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:00,330
most likely will not buy iphone where I

00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,410
can't control the boot process from A to

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,110
Z and another issue phones where it's

00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:13,800
easy to break by accidentally flashing

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:17,820
to the wrong partition anything this is

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:21,420
how something that's to be continued and

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:24,330
now I'm ready for your questions

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,480
hopefully ask me anything we've got some

00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,480
time

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:41,420
hey how many phones have you bricked

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,380
while trying to run this can you repeat

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:52,370
please how many phones have you broken

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:55,010
none but it's--it's is the easy way you

00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:58,070
don't have much risk as long as you

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,470
don't flash the boot loader there one

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:03,170
bit before Linux if you only flash the

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:07,060
bits on your Android phone where Linux

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:10,760
resides it's as far as I know like

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:13,940
99.99999 percent safe I don't want you

00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,580
to come to me when when you bro when you

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,030
break a phone but I think that as long

00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,830
as you don't flash stuff to partitions

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,850
you shouldn't flash stuff to it's going

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:28,340
to be fine I have a question of my own

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:31,790
yeah so you still keep the original

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,980
kernel in place and then UK exec or do

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,650
you even replace the original currently

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,470
right now it's building the OEM provided

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,420
kernels why well the reason is simple

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,590
everything already works with that

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:47,960
kernel there why did the Wi-Fi the

00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:51,070
cameras the sound the everything is

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,600
supposed to work with this kernel then

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,950
this kernel could get updated some

00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,770
projects already update kernels from

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:06,470
Android OEMs so what I'd like is that

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:08,630
there's always going to be the IMG

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,339
kernel that's going to be a stable one

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,709
one way that you trust one that you've

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:15,140
built and you know works and then you're

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:17,360
always able to just take Zak into a a

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,310
new new kernel that might be mainline

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,670
hopefully be my line and where you're

00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:30,710
working on porting it and bettering the

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:34,130
whole index ecosystem which has all your

00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:37,580
checkbox checked how much hard work and

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:42,470
sweat separates me from booting like

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:44,460
days weeks months your first part may be

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,160
a week depending on

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,560
if you're lucky if the phone is trivial

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,300
to port to but when you're using a phone

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,060
that's already well supported with line

00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,720
SOS in my experience it's much easier

00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:00,210
since you everything is like listed

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,480
already in the in the open are there

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:08,550
phones to part two of our phones where

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:12,270
there's only the OEM source dump and no

00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:14,180
community yet like the redmi note 7

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,980
right here right here

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,400
fun story that's my first channel me

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:22,080
cornell i for sharing phone first

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,270
channel from their turnout of

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,020
open-source kernel release it would not

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,480
boot not at all I finally figured it out

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:33,390
since during these times some other

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,430
projects were reporting it and then when

00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,110
I found out which option I was acting I

00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,870
searched online what this option was

00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,710
doing and it's documented in the wiki of

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:46,920
the project

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:50,910
so basically read the tags so when you

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,370
use the kernel sources from the OEMs do

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,890
you can can you reuse the Linux builds

00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:59,580
that we use the next packages or have do

00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:02,490
you have to write your own for that when

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,010
a device gets ported to mainline then

00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,890
generate will mean that you can use a

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,630
numeral kernel but until then you're

00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,790
going to need to build a kernel

00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:15,870
specialized for your phone or maybe a

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:18,170
familiar phones is it the right answer

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:24,240
the right question that had answered

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:27,000
okay so if you're using the OEM kernel

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,180
with their modules and drivers which

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,800
would support the hardware like ite what

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,860
is the challenge to get those devices

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,840
working can you repeat the at the end of

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,630
the question what what's standing

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,870
between you and supporting the devices

00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:44,550
like sound and for porting to mainline

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,700
the main issue is that most of the times

00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:51,180
the OEMs just drop horribly atrocious

00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,550
code to just make it work and so it just

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,430
can't be ported forward sometimes

00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,389
there's also breakage in the kernel ap

00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,119
is the internally

00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:01,079
the ice and it's always it's normal is

00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:04,829
to be expected

00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:07,799
they never said that a kernel API is

00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:10,379
stable it's the kernel ABI for user land

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:13,799
that is table so that's one main issue

00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:16,799
and then about just porting to you this

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,109
kernel to work on my bionics OS no

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:24,739
issues that's exactly what we're using

00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:28,200
we're using the OEM dumps to get started

00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:31,559
perhaps one more question all right have

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:38,369
you looked at packaging what Jolla have

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:47,219
as the UI continuation of the Nokia

00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:50,359
operate operating system selfish if you

00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:52,529
have looked at packaging those things

00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,469
because I don't think they're going to

00:20:52,529 --> 00:21:00,089
be extra friendly the packaging outside

00:20:55,469 --> 00:21:03,299
of the distribution currently I I'm not

00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:06,209
working on anything else than a standard

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,129
gnu/linux distribution so it's it should

00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:11,190
be possible just like everything is

00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:15,359
possible with enough time to make the

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:18,389
whole sailfish OS build with NYX but

00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,299
it's more selfish even though it's more

00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:24,809
new Linux than Android is still like

00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:27,809
it's always like just loon OS which is

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:30,629
the open source port of webOS is its own

00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:32,969
integrated operating system so just

00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:35,909
taking bits from them sometimes is

00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:38,959
harder so it's it should be possible but

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:44,029
it's not a current goal due to lack of

00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:44,029
human power working on the project

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:58,220
any more questions would you benefit of

00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,679
us giving you our old phones to make

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,690
them all work on Nexus I will benefit if

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:13,730
you were to use your old phone to port

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:16,190
it to not only because I'm lazy but also

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,990
because you're going to have a phone

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,149
with mobile UNIX OS in your hands so

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,629
you're going to be able to test it and

00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:27,379
maybe file bugs or even better PRS for

00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:29,690
whatever is missing for you and the

00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:32,090
second question would be for the grant

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:34,159
that you got is it limited to some

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,779
extent to only to you or is it possible

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,730
that in the future you might extend your

00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:41,600
project to have like multiple people

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:45,740
working on that as well if it's about

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,409
the grant I'm not perfectly sure I could

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,960
ask people from I think are hidden in

00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:58,820
the room and they will tell me if it's

00:22:50,960 --> 00:23:01,100
alright but I think so alright so and

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,629
since there is no microphone the best

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,240
thing to do is to write a new proposal

00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:09,259
which means from myself or something

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:13,460
like that yes so if you have additional

00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:15,320
features that you like if you have

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,059
additional features that or additional

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,830
phones that you would like to help which

00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:24,379
are maybe not as doing right now but you

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,029
can also ask for a fairly small grant to

00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:27,409
help

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,570
well there's a dozen the question

00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:31,309
answered and if you want to do a whole

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,909
desktop which would be a larger thing

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,909
that's all

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:48,510
well it was fun presenting to you have a

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,510
nice day thank you

00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:56,880
