	00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,899
it's about the next generation

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,390
initiative and the other ways to get

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:15,019
your nixels project funded from our mean

00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,019
all right thank you

00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,480
[Applause]

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:23,220
so can you hear me all fine okay good so

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,539
my name is Armand as some of you might

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,480
have noticed I'm probably the only

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,789
person here not using NEX OS it's

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,289
actually Fedora so what we were and say

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,539
yeah you can boo me you can throw things

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,379
at me but only chocolate please

00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:39,780
so when we were driving here to do this

00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:41,309
conference Rob just kept saying like no

00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,260
just give me your laptop I will just

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,139
install Nick Swiss right now and it said

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,469
just keep your eyes on the road okay all

00:00:46,139 --> 00:00:50,100
right

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,530
so let's talk about money that mean Mean

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,170
Green so and how you can get paid for

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,449
working on an open source project

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,399
including Nixon Nixon West so Samuel

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,319
already talked a little bit about what

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,290
he did and I'm going to explain a little

00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:07,800
bit more about the specifics to together

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,960
with your hair from an omelet so this is

00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,580
an interactive talk so feel free to ask

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,260
questions on the other end I've got

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,430
quite a few slides so you might want to

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,110
ask them at the end so a little bit of a

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,440
poll how many of you are currently

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,260
working getting paid to work on open

00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,420
source suffer so there's one that's sir

00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,630
so how many of you would like to get

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:36,750
paid for it so then this talk is mostly

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:39,260
for you so next generation Internet

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,780
basically this is something and a

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:46,080
program in the horizon 2020 programs a

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,490
research program from the EU and it is

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,930
about making a more human internets so

00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,000
that's the perb that i got from their

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,530
website as i'm not going to read it but

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,390
basically you have to see it as

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,000
reimagining and re-engineering the

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,300
internet so currently the Internet as we

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,900
know it is it has very much has a

00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,090
Silicon Valley imprint basically it's

00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,760
DNA there's there's a lot of it just

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,599
screams Silicon Valley on the other hand

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,120
there is also a lot of

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,040
going on in other parts of the world to

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,170
create their own internet so think of

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,209
what's happening in China but also in

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,560
India if you're following a little bit

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,780
of what's happening with the internet in

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,049
India it can get quite scary

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,750
so what their government is trying to do

00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:34,389
so the EU even though it can be

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,909
considered kind of big in a Morlock it's

00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:39,280
at times they want to re-engineer the

00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:43,739
Internet make it more humane and to get

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,129
the valley core values like democracy

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:49,209
diversity and so on engrained into a

00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,599
into the Internet to make it actually

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:55,480
make it a better internet i think i that

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,120
kind of Soros is agreeing so once a

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,290
project of that is NGO zero which I will

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,250
be talking about today so

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:09,280
ngi zero first of all it's a consortium

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:10,989
with quite a few organizations involved

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,419
there I'm not going to run through all

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,769
of them but the most important ones of

00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:17,709
course you see there Nixa West

00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,659
foundation that's us yeah and an L net

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:23,669
foundation and a whole bunch of others

00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,669
where people are

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,400
actually I should have had that picture

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,620
soda recorded quite a few organizations

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,300
involved things like translations secure

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:42,210
software packaging accessibility you

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,340
name it so they're whole bunch of

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:52,210
organizations involved in the NGI zero

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:55,330
project alright so but before I can

00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,400
explain what we actually do I need to

00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,310
talk to you a little bit about what a

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,980
normal grant procedure in the EU looks

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,770
like so the normal process to get funds

00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,170
in the horizon 2020 program or any EU

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,360
program for that matter is basically

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:13,180
like this you have to form a consortium

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,880
of at least three organizations from

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,950
various countries or partners from the

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,020
right parts of Europe so you get one

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,280
from North Europe you get one from the

00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,360
Garlic countries and one from the

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,750
cabbage countries and then you're

00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,350
usually fine so and so from all -

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:33,520
graphically nice so that the right parts

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,710
you send in a proposal then you do stuff

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,480
for a few years and then you basically

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,690
throw something over the wall and you

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,170
get paid so and then sometimes it

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,290
doesn't even compile or even work or do

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:50,800
what it was supposed to do so this is a

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,320
very process heavy thing it's not very

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,810
suitable for open stores because most of

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,260
us we like to work in a much more agile

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:03,010
way so now two small projects fast

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,510
releases work and tiny things and then

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,230
just move on to the next interesting

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:12,880
thing because that's how we work but

00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:17,620
this process is not for us it's for the

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,800
big corporations it's the big telcos the

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,170
big industrial conglomerates actually

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,310
have whole departments just writing

00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:29,740
proposals to get money out of the EU and

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,660
if you're actually looked at doing one

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,490
of those proposals I did it's it's it's

00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,620
horrible it doesn't work for us I need

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,510
to get I need to hire something like two

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,400
or three people to actually do that

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,350
stuff and then have them on a payroll of

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,870
course I will get it reimbursed

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:47,590
but it's a lot of overhead this is

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,510
totally not suited for SMEs or open

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,520
source developers and it's also not

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,680
helping the public because you get

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,020
something that might not even work but

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
you know it fits the proposal they can

00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,920
they got money for it so it should be

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,920
good right so basically a lot of this

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:08,080
money is not working for us and that is

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:11,790
something that should change so a no net

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,400
foundation basically they organized a a

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:17,020
consortium and they try to see like okay

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,480
maybe we can do something that we've

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,920
already done for the last 20 years so

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,290
and all that foundation is a Dutch

00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,560
nonprofit they trace their history back

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,810
to the very first internet provider in

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,010
the Netherlands so in 1982 that's before

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:35,500
most of you were born so and then they

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,140
sold their provider off to you you net

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,050
later Verizon they got a bunch of money

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,390
they formed a non-profit and since 1997

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,930
so before some of you were born they've

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:51,100
been handing out grants to open source

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,530
development so basically what they are

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,630
doing is a very lightweight approach and

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,570
developer says like I've got this great

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,940
idea sends in a proposal and now that

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,940
looks at it and things like you know if

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,820
you can do this stuff then we are

00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,360
willing to make a donation to you and

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:13,060
it's super lightweight developer starts

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,950
working delivers and then there is a

00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,320
payout after completion of the

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,510
milestones and that's just the complete

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,360
opposite of how the normal EU grants

00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,460
work and this is this has been working

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,210
for a very long time so more than 20

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,930
years they've they've sponsored things

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,460
like DNS SEC many other things that I

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,110
don't even remember there's a whole list

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,940
on the website there's a lot of stuff

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,500
that if they've done so in the

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,830
background have been doing a lot of very

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,600
good stuff and also what's important

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,760
they're a registered charity in the

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,890
Netherlands and in at least in the

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,780
Netherlands and also in some of the

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,310
countries you can actually get it and it

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,040
gets because it's a donation from a

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:59,530
charity you don't pay taxes

00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:01,750
can be nice so NL Ned wanted to bring

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:04,510
this lightweight process to the horizon

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:08,770
2020 program so they found they formed

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:11,650
the ng i0 consortium and basically then

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,320
they sent in proposals to the EU and

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:17,940
then they were awarded 11.2 million euro

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:22,030
to spend on open-source development

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,710
which is pretty cool so and then for two

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,560
themes one of them is search and

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:29,110
discovery which is basically unlocking

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,870
all kinds of data making sure that

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,010
people can discover their data in some

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:38,740
way so think search engines IOT search

00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:42,100
whatever anything search and discovery

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:46,930
related and then also privacy enhancing

00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:49,660
technology so thanks security and B EU

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,620
is also carefully paying attention to

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,600
see how this how this will work because

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,000
they know that well I think that they

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,310
secretly know that their normal grant

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,470
process doesn't really work it doesn't

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,640
really work for the people in the EU so

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,340
there's things like okay how can we

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,530
change it okay so if the grant program

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,360
works for some people in the EU but not

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,430
the vast majority so there's things like

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,210
okay well how can we make it work for

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:18,550
everyone so they're paying attention and

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,900
seeing how things will work out and then

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,450
maybe if it's successful

00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:27,130
they might expand this and that would be

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:30,160
good for all of us so you just told me

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,230
that around so as of today where we've

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,100
been running this for but what ten

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:39,250
months one year it's a bit less than one

00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,680
year and so far formal million euro has

00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,830
been allocated for development in these

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,580
two domains for about 100 120 projects

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:50,200
and what is interesting is that 95% of

00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,850
the grant seekers they've never

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,240
participated in any of the grant

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:58,060
programs of the EU before so at least in

00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,240
the horizon 2020 so they are now

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,790
reaching a completely new group of

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,910
people that are in need of a grant but

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,690
couldn't get it or didn't want it didn't

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,780
know how to get

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,260
or thought it was way too much overhead

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:17,620
so that's a very good thing

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,320
so I already shown that one so and then

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,510
of course the the row of Nick's OS in

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,190
this consortium so another foundation

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,650
they are big fans of Nick's OS we have

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,960
history going back a long time even

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,490
before Nick so s started because the

00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,880
current director of technology of

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,970
analyst foundation was actually working

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,070
for the Dutch Academy of Sciences and he

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:43,870
got so and he was the person who

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:45,370
basically read alko's original proposal

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,690
and signed off on it

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:51,280
so it is even going back from way before

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,170
there was next to us and way before he

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,750
was working for an illness foundation so

00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,880
there's a very long history which is

00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,500
cool so and they really like Nick's

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,050
arrest they think it's fantastic and of

00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,980
course it is and they are convinced that

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,870
things like deployment of software and

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,050
to make it easy would be very essential

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,490
to make this pros project work because

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,140
normally they would get something like

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:16,510
yeah you know to run this software you

00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,340
need to run this specific version of

00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:21,640
Ubuntu with these packages and maybe

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,680
that patch or another component you need

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,570
to have souza with these packages

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,150
installed and that out of tree stuff and

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,480
I just thought like that that's just too

00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,370
cumbersome that will never ever work to

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,160
make it agile to make it make it a

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,980
smooth process so the ideal is that when

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,410
a project comes in that we help them

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,800
with things like packaging and software

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,080
that and then the software could be

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,420
demoed and would be like that just run

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,540
Nick shell or Nick's build and then just

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:55,390
run it and then it would work that's the

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,160
ideal so that's why we are involved so

00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,740
we've been giving funds to help with

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,930
things like packaging the software in

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,930
the projects that are coming in through

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,660
ngi zero and also to improve the next OS

00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,510
infrastructure itself to help with the

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,370
packaging as part of ngi zero so we've

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,740
we've been giving some funds we can

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:19,980
choose to spend them as we like as long

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,980
as they fit within these two categories

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:27,709
so then of course the question is what

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,800
can you do one of them is that you could

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,589
send in a project and please remember it

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,990
remember that it doesn't have to be

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,760
about Nick's or Nick's OS itself it has

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,730
to be about search and discovery or

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,750
about privacy enhancing technologies

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:46,730
anything else so the thing is that if

00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,220
you have got a cool idea even if it's

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,630
outside of Nick's OS and you think like

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,269
okay well you know this is something

00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,800
that that would benefit the world and

00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:57,589
it's about search and discovery or

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,540
privacy enhancing technology send in a

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:03,050
proposal please so I think the next

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:05,389
deadline is December 1st so December 1st

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,269
so you still have about one and a half

00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:09,290
months

00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,730
packaging software is also something

00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,709
that you could do and there might be a

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,769
few opportunities for this in the near

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:18,220
future we're just still looking into

00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,060
this or you could help improve

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,880
infrastructure and there might also be a

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,490
few opportunities there as well so you

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:30,500
should just come talk to us if you're

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,029
interested and then how you should send

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,209
in a proposal first of all keep it

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:38,980
concise so you don't need to send any

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:42,620
PhD thesis a few things like a few pages

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,470
clear deadlines clear milestones and how

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:49,160
much per per milestone that is basically

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:52,699
what is needed and be realistic don't

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,760
ask for the moon because 11.2 million

00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:58,930
euros is a lot of money but there's it

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:03,680
has to be spread across many projects so

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:05,899
just keep it just be realistic split big

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,630
projects into several smaller parts if

00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:11,630
you if you would want to and be patient

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:14,060
so the proposals are first reviewed by

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,560
an independent committee and then

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,240
they're sent off to the EU for

00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,970
additional review and so you have to

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,459
think of so one of the reviews that the

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,170
EU will do is something like looking at

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:25,579
if you're not on a blacklist because

00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,860
they actually have a blacklist where

00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,899
people apply for grants but were

00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,389
convicted for fraud or whatever they

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:35,930
will simply not be able to produce it

00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:38,779
so this process takes some time it could

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,189
take some months before you get to go

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,449
ahead so if you're thinking like okay

00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:44,410
well you know I need to need to be

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:46,970
starting on December 2nd then well know

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,069
then you have to calculate that there

00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,040
will be a few months delay in there

00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:54,230
it's just how it works also get

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,879
inspiration from existing projects all

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,269
of the projects that a noun that has

00:14:55,879 --> 00:15:03,559
found it as funded they are on their

00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:05,870
website and the thing is that that is

00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,410
very important even if you're not in the

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,300
EU you can still send in in a proposal

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:14,959
so what is important is that it benefits

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:18,529
Internet users in the EU it has to be

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,269
for for a better European internet it

00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,009
but the thing is that something that's

00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:25,069
good for the world is probably also good

00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:27,439
for Europe so even if you're outside of

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:29,689
Europe you can still send in so I could

00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:33,019
make an obligor obligatory and brexit

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:36,939
joke here I will not do that but even if

00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:36,939
you're in the UK you can still send it

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:43,370
so some of the approved projects right

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,759
now

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:50,720
so mixed packages update from Ryan that

00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:54,139
is he's one that was approved so he will

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,050
be working on things like automatically

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:59,899
checking C fees to see if there are

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,399
updated so if there are updates to

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:04,579
packages and then automatically try to

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:06,319
integrate it spectrum from ELISA so

00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:10,129
she's working on that as well so that

00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,809
also got some good some funding and of

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:15,319
course you just saw Samuels

00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:17,809
talk about mobile NICs OS but of course

00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:21,139
that's not the only stuff so some

00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:23,179
examples of some other projects one one

00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:26,350
that I am personally very excited about

00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:29,059
is be trusted from Andrew Huang this

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:33,100
some of you might know as bunny so he's

00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:35,420
making a protected hardware device for

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,129
protected matters that's what is what so

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,019
something like some sort of sleeve for

00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,209
your mobile phone where you can store

00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,939
passwords and then your phone actually

00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,620
has to access that device to get access

00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:48,440
to private things so

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,170
those evil apps or it cannot get access

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,610
to your private data and that's

00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,960
something that personally I think is

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,490
super super cool another one that I have

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,820
not looked at but which your set is

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,560
super cool is a very pal which is about

00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,770
verifying security of cryptographic

00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:13,910
protocols maybe you want to talk about

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:16,280
that for a few seconds my name is I

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,189
actually work for now that so if you

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,300
have any questions afterwards about this

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:27,319
process just come to me I'm here until

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:31,809
Sunday so happy to talk to to anything

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,309
about anything but this project yeah so

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,980
cryptographic protocols of course it's

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:39,650
very important we are financing this

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,300
project under the guise of privacy

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,360
because if something is not safe you

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,900
cannot protect your privacy and what

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:51,550
very well is is it's a simpler way than

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,470
some of verifying protocols then what

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,870
academics are using right now it's very

00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,350
hard to prove that the protocol is

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,500
secure and what the author of F pal has

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,820
done hey yes he has created a

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,670
infrastructure a software project that

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,520
that makes it much easier to verify this

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:15,380
and on top of that he even used our

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,440
financing to hire a manga company to

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,870
write a manual which is completely in

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,840
manga style so if you look up fare of

00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:26,179
Perl projects you you can have some nice

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,880
nice nice manga reading and learn

00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:35,240
something about security so I'm not sure

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:39,230
what kind of comic book style we should

00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,140
use for next to us so and then also

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:45,200
another project discourse activity pub

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:50,710
so you can have a distribute its things

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:53,270
thing with likes according to to us but

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:55,700
that's of course not the only way you

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,650
can actually get funding so there are

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,940
many many other opportunities to get

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:02,000
open source Development Fund

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,040
including things like tax cuts tax cuts

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,600
and grants and a lot of people that I

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,540
talk to they actually don't know that

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,450
these opportunities exist so I just want

00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,610
to highlight a few of them so in the

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,000
Netherlands companies can actually get

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:20,780
an income tax cut for innovative work so

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,190
it's called WBS oh I will not say it in

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,910
Dutch because most of you would not even

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:28,640
understand it but basically if you're a

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,890
freelancer or sole trader or one-person

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,660
company whatever you want to call it or

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,960
you're a limited company you can

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:38,450
basically apply for this and have a tax

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:42,620
offset for your income tax which is very

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,990
very useful so I actually use that for

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,190
my own company I spend a minimum of five

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,230
hundred years on research and

00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:53,810
development and then I get a tax

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:56,420
reduction so I read so my taxable income

00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,580
is actually lowered with the with the

00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:00,170
serve with the subsidy and over that

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,270
part I basically don't pay any income

00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:06,410
tax which easily saves me a few thousand

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:08,360
euro per year which is nice this is

00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,130
actually quite common for companies to

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,860
do in another one sir there's a whole

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,540
industry built around these subsidies so

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,520
it's sometimes it might feel feel like

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,470
it's unethical but I'm just thinking

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,470
about I'm taking back my text money to

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:24,560
do good stuff with it instead of some

00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,540
companies who that was just built around

00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,360
getting subsidies and then just you know

00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,700
lining their own pockets which is very

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,850
often what happens so I'm just this is a

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,590
good thing so then there's also starting

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,540
companies that can get an even higher

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,660
tax cut so if you're thinking like okay

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:44,600
you know I've I have a Dutch company I

00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:46,250
want to free up some of my personnel

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,040
time to actually work an open source

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,830
software you have a research proposal

00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,900
you send it in you actually see get a

00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,030
text cut and you basically you can

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,690
deliver something to the world which is

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,240
beneficial to a lot of people which is

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,790
nice so if you're of course if you're

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,510
kinda evil and you're doing things like

00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:10,200
patents or selling licenses to IP then

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,430
in certain

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,520
so also in the Netherlands you can get a

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:18,730
very big tax cut on some taxes so

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,200
instead of 25% you only pay 7% so that's

00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,870
what the big companies are using by

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,700
selling their IP so of course I'm hoping

00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,590
that none of you are actually thinking

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,080
about applying for patents and then

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,520
licensing them to other people but

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,890
that's another discussion we could have

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,410
but I'm using this to illustrate that

00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,210
there's a lot of stuff out there that

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,690
can be used by companies and that

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,860
actually is being used by companies and

00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,720
most open-source people don't know

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,880
anything about it and that's a wasted

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,240
opportunity

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:54,010
so in Sweden there is also an innovation

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,800
agency that you can also talk to about

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,330
research grants called ANOVA so I know a

00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,060
few people who've done that successfully

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:06,490
and they're also using it to do open

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:08,860
source stuff it's very useful in the

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:12,100
Netherlands there's the ISDN fund so

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,600
that's the domain registered registry

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:19,060
that has their own fund to work on

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,980
programs to improve the internet so you

00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,900
can also apply for something between ten

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,630
thousand and seventy five thousand euro

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:29,950
for a grant if you're doing something

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:32,950
good for the internet so in Germany you

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:35,280
can go to the game you inovative

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,750
which is something from one of the

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,790
federal ministries so you can actually

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,560
apply there as well they have a research

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,440
and development program and there's

00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:47,650
things like the prototype fund these are

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:53,410
all open to research and development or

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:56,740
open innovation so in your country there

00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,090
are most likely opportunities as well so

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,430
I haven't even looked at things like

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,520
like Spain but I'm pretty sure there's

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,740
there's something like that there as

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,880
well in Italy there should be in France

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,980
as well but it really pays off to do

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,010
some research into this if you would

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:18,400
just want to have someone to pay you for

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:22,810
doing open source software developments

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,830
with a or open source research so if you

00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,149
are in this situation

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,980
you're thinking like okay well you know

00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:29,350
I really want to work on open source

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,110
stuff but I don't know where to get the

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,440
money from just look into this it can

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:43,140
really pay off

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:43,140
and then basically QA anyone

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,970
[Applause]

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:59,249
so I want the Mayflower a medium-sized

00:23:55,379 --> 00:24:01,019
company and I'm wondering if I want if I

00:23:59,249 --> 00:24:04,379
have a project where I want to improve

00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,039
Nick's would it make more sense to try

00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:09,239
and do that through the company or

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,649
independently I would say that that

00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:14,580
depends on your contract with your

00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:16,919
company so and I would first talk to

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,629
your boss about that because might be

00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,429
that your current contract actually says

00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:22,470
that everything you do even in your

00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:26,029
spare time belongs to the company that's

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,899
not the case if that's not the case

00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:31,080
depends on whether or not you would be

00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:32,879
competing with your company so whatever

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,460
what I would do is just first talk to

00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:37,529
your company I talk to your boss I work

00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,850
something out that even even then it

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:43,769
might be better if the company actually

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:46,799
applies for funding yeah so there's is

00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:49,529
there anything on the side of well and a

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:57,749
Nelnet that would speak for one or the

00:24:49,529 --> 00:25:02,639
other we accommodate both so if you want

00:24:57,749 --> 00:25:04,649
to apply individual that's fine and in

00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:09,960
some countries it's good to get easier

00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:13,919
to get tax cuts because as was said if

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,200
you get a grant from us basically what

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,970
happens if you you send in a plan you

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,279
fulfill what's done in the plan and then

00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,580
we give you a donation that's not

00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,549
taxable income right so that's an

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,889
advantage to you if however you do it

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:31,169
with a company then the company will

00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:33,299
have to pay taxes on your salary so

00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:36,830
depending on that you may can make the

00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:39,809
evaluation what would be more beneficial

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:42,269
obviously you can do it for a company if

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:44,100
that's if that's something they would

00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:46,080
prefer but you can do it as an

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,169
individual as a company as a comp as a

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,289
combination of a company individual

00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:52,980
non-for-profits

00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:54,570
from our side anything goes we just when

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,489
you put in a proposal we accept it we

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,889
write a small memorandum of

00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,480
understanding in which we say when you

00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:03,720
do this we give you a donation

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,790
and that's who is who is part of this

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,040
MOU it doesn't really matter to us in

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:10,580
this case there has to be a link to ryu

00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,580
but that's it

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,440
other questions

00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:21,510
yes can you say anything about the the

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,440
not like who reads these how technical

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:28,890
can you get in a proposal do you need to

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,179
dress up certain certain things or well

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,740
so you also actually reading those

00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:45,900
proposals so I'm just going to give the

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:47,970
microphone back to him again okay so it

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:52,799
can be fairly technical I mean I'm a

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:56,390
nexus user or we have you know more than

00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:01,260
half of our people are using Nyx's and

00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:03,720
of that more than half would be able to

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,520
write an exhaust recipe themselves and

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,570
Nexus expressional sells so fairly good

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,370
that doesn't mean that we know

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:15,770
everything about all of the cryptography

00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:19,850
layers but we do have a long history of

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:23,070
subsidizing projects so we mainly know

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,340
not just a technical stuff but also who

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,620
are the longtime players already and we

00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,910
know how to look at for example commit

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,410
histories and projects if that's

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,090
something you want a reference that's

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:34,890
something that we can easily understand

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,830
even if we don't know the particularly

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,090
library you're talking about we can very

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,580
easily look at your commit history

00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,380
somewhere and see look this guy wants a

00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,510
grant for this project and he helped

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,950
start it or since how for years the

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,799
maintainer or he's written this cool

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:52,730
feature for it that's something that we

00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,730
do look heavily at

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:03,720
I don't have so much as a question as

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,490
like in addition to that I applied with

00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,090
lizard a project to do open

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:11,669
communication stuff are the proposals

00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,440
you get to send in are fairly limited in

00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,299
terms of words so the amount of

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,980
technical stuff you can actually squeeze

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:21,480
in is fairly limited like if you want to

00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,730
go into details you straight up don't

00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,960
have the space for that so that makes

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,960
things easier

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:45,100
I thanks for a great talk I'm curious

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,470
about what's your view on collaborations

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:51,260
say to individuals or to companies would

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,710
like to make a proposal together is that

00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,780
something that you've done before how's

00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:01,070
the process around that we do that all

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:04,940
the time yeah but what we do often

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,650
prefer if a collaboration is fine if you

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,960
can split it up so that you have

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,120
independent projects that have

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,250
independent deliverables that's

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,360
something we always prefer because it

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:19,070
makes it easier that if one one part of

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,929
the possible collaboration finishes

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:25,910
early we can already finish off that

00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:27,620
administrative Lea whereas if you're in

00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:32,300
a collaboration you depend on that

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:35,960
everybody finishes to get to wrap up the

00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:37,880
project but yeah of course we very much

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,160
encourage encourage collaborations and

00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,200
we also encourage that when you apply a

00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,600
look at the proposals we founded in the

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:50,990
past because then you have an idea of

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:56,870
the sort of the type of projects that we

00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:58,460
do actually it actually goes from very

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:02,150
low in the stack to very high that's

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:04,910
something the bandwidth which wasn't yet

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,710
very much emphasized but we have

00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,660
supported hardware actually routing

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,480
hardware but we have also we also

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:18,610
support end-user applications right so

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:18,610
it can be very wide thank you

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:30,140
I have a question so this this hasn't

00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,980
been addressed so I'm curious like with

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,580
regards of the funding itself okay you

00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,620
can get tax cuts that's great but what's

00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,670
a reasonable expectation for the funds

00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:46,220
like can you can you get like industry

00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:48,020
standard rates or is it takes like how

00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:53,000
does how does that evaluate in the

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:54,920
proposal so how do you explain the so of

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,050
course if you are a highly paid

00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,180
consultant asking something like 200

00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:02,480
euro per hour forget it that's that's

00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:05,870
not and I don't think that the EU will

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:09,380
actually say that that's okay so no

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,240
industry standard rates that's not gonna

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,860
fly but I think that what would be a

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,300
reasonable ballpark figure as you saw in

00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,970
the presentation currently we have

00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:26,960
allocated four million four hundred and

00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:28,820
twenty projects yeah I mean okay that's

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,490
that still depends on how many people

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:36,560
and for how long so most of the projects

00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:38,330
are single individuals but yeah if you

00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,560
would like to go with an hourly rate

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:45,380
then it's it's not it's not consultant a

00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,780
consultant level it also depends we're

00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:50,720
living basically you are in your

00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,490
proposal you you determine what your

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,190
hourly rate will be we just give a

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:59,870
donation if we think it's worthwhile

00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:00,530
alright so make an educated guess all

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,110
right thanks

00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:06,400
but I can give you it can give you a few

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,400
hints after this talk

00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:12,539
so I just wanted to hook into the same

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,369
thing maybe to just simplify the

00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,350
question a little bit I guess the main

00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:18,869
question is is it something where you

00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,490
can say I want to have a project on

00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:22,529
which I want to work full-time for a

00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,600
year for example of which you can like

00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:26,820
pay living costs for example right is

00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,980
that the kind of target or would it be

00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,389
something where I say no usually when

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,039
people want to do a long term project

00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:33,929
like a year it would have to be a side

00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:35,879
project next to your normal work for

00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:38,309
example that I think that is the kind of

00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:39,779
thing that is the most interesting thing

00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:41,789
about that so I think there's actually

00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:44,009
both that some people are doing it as a

00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:45,809
side project for just a few thousand and

00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,369
I think that somehow some people are

00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,200
they're asking for a bigger grant I said

00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:54,450
so I think that the maximum you can ask

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,690
is for a really good first-time proposal

00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,519
we have given out like 50 thousands so

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:03,360
that should cover your expenses for a

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,509
long time but we fall so that was one

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,679
proposal for example he was a really

00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:14,129
great project to extend an existing

00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,649
project with activity Pub support and

00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:18,600
activity pop is a standard to sort of

00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:20,369
build a decentralized social network

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,929
where everybody just likes each other

00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:26,190
via messages on the home website and I'm

00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:28,470
not sure if it was the one that was

00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,389
extending this course but it was a great

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,669
great project which we liked so we

00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:35,100
wanted to fund it and at that point the

00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:36,720
the guy who was gonna do it got accepted

00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,990
into the solid team of Tim berners-lee

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,789
and obviously he went for that but he

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,100
said I still want to do that can I do it

00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:47,009
in the weekends and then ask for well

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,869
much less obviously and we were so happy

00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:51,539
there it was so committed to doing the

00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:54,779
stuff that he wanted to do before that

00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:56,519
we accepted it so you can do it both you

00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:58,139
can combine something which you want to

00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,600
do in your spare time or maybe reduce

00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:03,529
your number of hours a week a bit and in

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:08,090
that time work for a Nelnet project or

00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:08,090
try to do it full-time

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,060
so I think there are no more questions

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,270
because the microphone has been taken

00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,950
away so if there are any any other

00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,020
questions that you just want to ask us

00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,510
so both yours and I will be here for the

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,490
four at least today and tomorrow and us

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,500
will also be here on Sunday I will not

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,179
be so just to come up to us ask

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,780
questions we would be more than happy to

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,780
answer them

00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:40,699
