Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: NixCon 2019 (Brno)
Description: 
	This talk will present experiments at building packages incrementally by relying on an external cache outside the nix sandbox. We will show how tools such as distcc and bazel can benefit from impure information during the build, and discuss how this impacts purity and reproducibility.
