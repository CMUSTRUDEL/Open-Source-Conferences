Title: Utilizing a NixOps Plugin Architecture (NixCon 2019)
Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: NixCon 2019 (Brno)
Description: 
	NixOps, a tool for deploying NixOS machines in a network or cloud, has historically been developed through a single repository. This presentation will review the incentive for moving to an alternative NixOps plugin based architecture where feature sets for specific cloud or network providers are moved to their own repositories. The work in progress toward such an architecture will be discussed and examples of build and deploy demonstrated.
