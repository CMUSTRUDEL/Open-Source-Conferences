Title: Peering into the Land of Parentheses - Guix from the Nix Perspective (NixCon 2019)
Publication date: 2019-12-14
Playlist: NixCon 2019 (Brno)
Description: 
	Nix has a sibling, which looks very different, but functions in a very similar manner - Guix of the GNU project.
This talk will explore what exactly it is and, in particular, how it compares to Nix.
We look at whether Nix can take some inspiration from it and whether it is useful as a complimentary tool.
