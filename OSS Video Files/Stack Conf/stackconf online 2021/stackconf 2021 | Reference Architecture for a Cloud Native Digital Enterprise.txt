In an era of digital transformation, (digital) enterprises are looking for fast innovation through effective collaboration to deliver more value to their customers with dramatically less effort. Digital enterprises enable companies of every sector to integrate, expose, and monetize their business capabilities by digitizing entire value chains. As a result, APIs have become the norm to expose integrated business functionalities to deliver an enhanced digital experience. Enterprises can start their digital transformation in greenfield or brownfield; in both cases, having a well-defined API-led integration architecture is important. Apart from integration and API platforms, these architectures should be able to provide agility, flexibility, and scalability. This session discusses a vendor/technology-neutral reference architecture for a cloud native digital enterprise to increase productivity by having agility, flexibility, and scalability through automation and services. The architecture discussed in this session can be mapped into different cloud-native platforms (Kubernetes and service mesh), different cloud providers (Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google GCP), and infrastructure services to perform the implementation.
