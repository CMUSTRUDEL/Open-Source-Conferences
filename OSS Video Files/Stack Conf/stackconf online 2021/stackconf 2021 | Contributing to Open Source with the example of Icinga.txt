Have you ever contributed to an open source project? There are tonnes of different ways to help out, and we want to show you how: From GitHub workflows and general contributing as well as more specific Icinga related topics. We at Icinga have been working on some guidelines for getting started with development on our projects â€“ contributing to the Icinga project has never been easier! That could be working on a plugin, a webmodule, fixing bugs in Icinga Web 2 or Icinga 2, adding features to the director or simply adapting the documentation.
