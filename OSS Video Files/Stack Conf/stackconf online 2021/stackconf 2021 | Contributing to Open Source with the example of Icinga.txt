Description: 
	by Feu Mourek

Have you ever contributed to an open source project? There are tonnes of different ways to help out, and we want to show you how: From GitHub workflows and general contributing as well as more specific Icinga related topics. We at Icinga have been working on some guidelines for getting started with development on our projects â€“ contributing to the Icinga project has never been easier! That could be working on a plugin, a webmodule, fixing bugs in Icinga Web 2 or Icinga 2, adding features to the director or simply adapting the documentation.

[Applause]

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:14,320
[Music]

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,279
hello everyone

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
welcome to and thank you for joining me

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,720
on my talk

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
contributing to open source with the

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,080
example of a singer

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,439
my name is voy muric my pronouns are

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
they them

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,279
and well who am i to talk to you about

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,719
this topic

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,200
um i work for two companies

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
one of them being netways the organizer

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,079
of this event where i

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,360
am a gitlab trainer so

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
i do occasional trainings on the topic

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,440
of

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,800
git basics and gitlab basics

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,600
which is the version control system

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,800
that is very often used in open source

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,760
projects

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,239
like for example on github where there's

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,520
also

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,760
get behind the system and uh

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
the other company that i work for is

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,840
isinger

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,680
who is also sponsoring this event where

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,479
i'm in the role of the development

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,400
advocate

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,600
which is basically the in between the

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,080
community

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,200
and the development so i started out

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,560
as a trainee to become

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,240
a developer and i did i also worked in

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,720
the development team for a while

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
and i slowly shifted over to the more

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,560
communicative role

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,439
of the system so i'm now mostly

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,840
in charge of doing talks like this one

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,000
um

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,479
roaming the community forums trying to

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,360
answer questions make peace

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,040
and mediate between the community and

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,840
our development team

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
so if there is an event hosted by a

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,000
singer

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,840
it's probably going to be me sitting

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,240
there talking to you

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,360
alongside with my colleague blairim for

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
example

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,439
who also did the little sponsoring pitch

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,360
that you might have seen

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,840
sometime in the past two days

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,760
uh he probably also explained what

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,720
singer is so i'm just gonna go

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
briefly over it singer does monitoring

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,879
so it's an

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,520
open source monitoring software which

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,800
encompasses infrastructure monitoring

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
for your data center

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
monitoring automation so you don't have

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
to enter everything

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,239
by hand uh cloud monitoring so you don't

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,640
just

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
observe your servers that are or your

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
machines that are standing there but

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,000
also

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,959
what's in the cloud we provide metrics

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
and logs

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
so you can properly contextualize your

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,160
data

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,319
analytics that help you analyze what

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,720
you've got and

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
perform proactively so look into the

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,160
future what might happen

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
is that heart rate going to go full or

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,120
not

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,599
and the most important part we also

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,599
notify the people on call to

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,760
you know help ease the pain of your

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,400
system

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,920
so that is basically what isinger does

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
what a singer is made of

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,040
is a bunch of official repositories

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,239
so different parts of the software being

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
out there on github

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,000
open sourced so there

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
are two core repositories as i would

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,239
call them

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,040
which is singer 2 and single web 2

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
which together form the basis of

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,840
everything else

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,440
which is different modules

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
and plugins from our official site there

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
are a few

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,840
but there are even more that are made by

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,319
the community and maintained by the

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,360
community

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,000
you can find most of those on

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,879
exchange.esinger.com

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,959
which is kind of our hub for everything

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,799
that the community made and wants to

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,840
publish

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,879
so there is the little core that is

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,959
managed by us there are our officially

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,040
supported modules and plugins

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,840
and of course the zinger stack but

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,400
there is so so much out there that is

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,440
made

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,280
by the community so

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,959
we understand ourselves as an open

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,639
source company

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
if you're here you probably know the

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,360
basic essence of open source already

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
but it means to us that there's more

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,040
than just

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
open source code more than just the

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
people that we see here in the office

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
that are working

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
on nisinga there are so so many people

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
out there that

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,759
help us thrive and live from your ideas

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,320
and contributions

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
so we want to invite you to join in on

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,840
the fun

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,400
um to help us out and i'm just going to

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,240
go briefly over what you can do

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,680
if you've never contributed or have

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
contributed already

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,479
to any kind of open source project and

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
try to help out even though you might

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,880
not be able to code

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,400
but being able to code is the thing that

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,680
comes to mind first

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,320
and there are different ways

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
so what you can do is obviously make

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,400
change

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,680
to the repositories so you could suggest

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
changes

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,039
or even submit your own code your own

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,960
features or bug fixes that you've made

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,800
but you could also try to make a

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
difference for other users

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
for other people that are just trying to

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,320
work with the product you're trying to

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,400
support so

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,639
for example you could post in the forums

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
or you could write blog posts write

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
tutorials

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,520
about the project that you're trying to

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,280
support

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,360
and help other users get into it easier

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,800
and you can help the developers out in

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,759
different ways too

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
not just by submitting code you could

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,919
test

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
software you could be starting

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
conversations

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,479
that help give the developers an idea on

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,880
how you use the software

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,080
so contributing takes different forms

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
it's more than just

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,479
submitting source code but since that is

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
the most obvious one

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,840
that's how we're going to start off

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,759
right now so

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,240
making changes to the repositories

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,720
first of all i'm going to show you what

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,600
a repository could be looking like

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,199
um on github so i'm going to show you

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,840
here this is the

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:37,039
um home page of a singer on github

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,880
basically so this is github.com

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,880
where there's a collection of our

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
different repositories

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,199
so i'm just going to go ahead and click

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,479
on isinga2

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,000
and here we have our little overview

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,319
there's our code there you can see here

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,599
with a little readme that helps you

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,199
get started with a project and there are

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,080
different issues that have been

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
submitted

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,120
by the community by our own developers

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,599
and that are being processed

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,960
there are the pull requests as they are

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,840
called

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
which are submitted code changes that

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,599
are there to be

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
reviewed before they can join the main

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,520
code

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
base and this is basically what you can

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,800
see

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,199
and look at in the isinga2 project on

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,199
github

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,520
so what you can do is interact with

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,840
those

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,280
issues you can just look through them

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,680
see if there's something that you know

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,759
about maybe a bug that has been found

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,319
that you have encountered as well

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
and you can just click on it and help

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,639
out by

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,360
helping reproduce an issue for example

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,560
um if you have a very similar setup and

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
a change

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,479
from the original setup of the poster

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,879
you can also inform and say like hey

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,800
yeah

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
this is what i've got the same way as

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
you have and

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,199
the bug still appears for me so maybe

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,759
that has something to do with it

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
so interacting with the issues the first

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
step

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,680
you could also of course fork the

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,039
repository and submit a pull request

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,879
so forking is the process

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,000
of making an own copy of the repository

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,280
for yourself

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,360
this has a lot to do with security

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,479
concerns basically so you can't just

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,000
submit something

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,240
to the vendors code so instead you make

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,279
a copy of the code

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,880
make your edits in your own environment

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,640
and when you're all done with that you

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,839
submit a pull request so

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,760
you request from the maintainers of the

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,800
vendor to pull over your changes

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,360
so you make your own thing in your fork

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
then you finish up what you wanted to do

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,240
and submit a pull request

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
over to the original repository and

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
there

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,080
there's going to be a little review

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,880
process by the developers or the

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
maintainers of the original project

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,399
and they might ask you to make some more

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,800
changes or they might

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,560
accept what you've done and merge it

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,920
into their

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,839
code base every project is different so

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,279
you might want to check for contributing

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,720
guidelines

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,640
in the singer project we have

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,720
a contributing.md a markdown file

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,760
which you can just click and look

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,279
through

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,200
what you can do and have to do to

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
contribute to the code to this

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
repository

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,920
um there might be other

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,600
areas where the contributing guidelines

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,880
for different projects might be hidden

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,480
so you can also

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
check their website or check their

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,120
forums if you want to support a project

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,839
to see if there are any guidelines that

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,040
you can follow that might help you

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,480
through the process of opening

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
opening up the pull request

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,000
so forking and branching there are a few

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
tips that i want to give you already and

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,560
that is

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,200
fix only one issue per change

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,279
so you look through a list of issues

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,959
they might even have a good first issue

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,720
tag on it or something

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,959
and then you click on it you read

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,640
through it think yeah i can fix that

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,560
and make your fix in your own fork

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,320
so and before you submit the pull

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
request you see another issue that you

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,399
could do

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,320
resist the urge to just add that to your

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,800
one pull requests

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,519
and send that one off and make a new one

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,980
for the new

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,200
issue because there might be

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,399
[Music]

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,160
um conflicts in one and not in the other

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,920
or one might be just accepted and

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
the other one needs more discussion or

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,240
something

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,240
try to

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,279
separate those in a way so do not put

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
too many changes into one issue just

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,160
leave

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,240
one thing at a time so it can be looked

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,760
at clearly

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,800
and try to keep it human readable

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,839
so choose a meaningful name for your

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
branch for your pull requests try to

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,760
describe

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
what you're doing in the best way

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,640
possible because maintainers receive

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,800
a bunch of different poor requests and

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,040
they need to understand what's going on

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,399
to rate whether it's a good change that

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,640
they want to include

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,560
or whether there should be other things

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,480
done to the pull request before it

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,240
um can be merged into the main code base

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
and the same of course applies for your

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
commits as well

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,959
so for every single change you make

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,600
you have one commit and

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,959
keep it readable that is the most

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,760
important part of it

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,560
keep your code readable and also your

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,959
messages

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
so there should be one headline that

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,600
really briefly

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
best under 80 characters describes

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,880
what you did with your change if you

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,399
need more space to explain what you did

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,560
just make a new line and another one so

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,040
you have an empty line in between

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,680
and then add the description what you

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,120
did

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,360
and why you did it what it fixed

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,519
and have your description in there and

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,480
then with another empty line in between

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,639
at you can add a reference so if there

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
is an issue

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,240
all issues here in github have

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,000
an issue number and in that issue number

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
there can be more discussion than just

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,560
in a commit message

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,839
so you add the keyword keyword

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,360
refs as in references and then you add

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,800
the issue number

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,920
to of your um issue and github will

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,360
automatically

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,440
link that issue in the pull request so

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,200
the maintainer or the developer that

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,560
looks through the pull requests can just

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,360
easily click on it

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,839
and see why you did what and add more

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
information to it

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,320
so try to make it as easy as possible

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,519
for the people reviewing

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,200
your changes to actually

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
get a gist of what you did

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,959
the best place to get started with that

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,000
if you're not as proficient in the

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,480
language the

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,720
project is written in is to start with

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,920
the documentation

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,839
every documentation will have typos

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,200
there is no way around it everything a

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,880
human writes out has

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,680
typos so what you can do is to

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,279
read through the documentation just note

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
the typos

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,760
and then submit a pull request to fix

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,519
those

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,560
um you can test the installation

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,320
process example of the installation

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,760
process for example

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,839
so uh if there is an installation guide

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
in the documentation try it with your

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,279
environment

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,880
you might even want to just set up a new

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,440
environment with a different operating

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,560
system

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,480
an unusual one and try out if the

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,839
installation guide still works there

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,360
because

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:17,440
there are so many environments that

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,279
that projects can be built in um

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,279
so you can test them all something might

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,519
slip through for the developers

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,480
so you can just fix up the documentation

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,399
and if there are any

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
structural changes that you've had in

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,639
mind it might be best to open an issue

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
or a pull request discussing those as

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,279
well

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
so if you think maybe the installation

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,440
should be

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,160
above the how to use you can just open

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,160
up an issue

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,160
describe hey maybe we should switch that

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
around and have that discussion

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,680
with the people maintaining the project

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,800
with the people that are developing for

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,560
that project

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,560
see if they think it's a good idea to

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,079
and then you can continue to contribute

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,639
and maybe make that change yourself

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,360
so as the talk said on the example of a

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,000
singer for

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,399
us the documentation is written in

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,639
github flavored markdown

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,639
and it's located in the dock

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,000
so if we go to isinga to the repository

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,279
again and scroll down

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,760
to the dock here we can click on it and

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,560
there's

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,680
all of the documentation that we have in

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,399
separate markdown files

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,880
um any changes that you make in here you

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,000
can

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,800
click on a file click on that little

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,880
edit button

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,040
and it will automatically automatically

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,639
make a fork for you

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,480
and you can edit it in the web interface

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,600
yourself so there's no need for setting

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,600
up an environment or anything as well

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,880
and all of that documentation that you

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,639
see here

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,240
is rendered in our website as well so

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,040
there's

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:55,519
singer.com learn so this learn tab

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,079
we have our documentation and if i click

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,440
on this

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:02,639
singer to docs here

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,839
you can see that exactly what we've seen

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:09,839
in the markdown file is also rendered

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
here

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,880
if you happen to find something here in

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,440
the docs maybe you've

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,240
read through the docs in this rendered

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,560
version

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,720
you can always click here on the viewed

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,880
on github which will take you directly

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,880
to the repository that it's about

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,920
okay so

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,399
what other options are there so if

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,480
you're

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,320
not proficient in coding if you don't

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,320
want to touch the

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,800
documentation or didn't find anything

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,000
that you could have changed or touched

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,480
up

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
there's always um more things you can do

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,279
you can make a change for other users

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,040
people that also just use the software

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,839
use the project that you want to help

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,640
out

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,799
and maybe uh you could be active in

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,839
their forums

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,120
so every project has a forum or a wiki

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,319
page

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,760
that you could be active on and

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,919
it's always good to interact with it

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,959
even if you're just asking questions if

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,120
you feel like you're

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,720
burdening people think about it

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,799
differently

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,080
the issue that you're having right now

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:33,360
that you're asking on the forum

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,600
might take a bit of time from the person

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,600
answering the question but it's also

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,160
helping out every other person that has

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,440
the same

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,280
issue and searches for it and then

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,720
finds your question and your answer so

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,160
you're helping others by just

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,720
asking questions and even

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,480
answering questions helps you understand

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,039
the problem better so

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,240
everyone's better off off with more

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,280
knowledge than before

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,000
you can start discussions as well so if

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,919
you have

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
uh if you see a new feature that was

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,799
freshly implemented

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,880
and you have a creative way of

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,080
using that feature or if you want to

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,520
know hey how

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,520
do others do this thing or how do others

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,600
tackle this or that problem

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,120
you can always ask about it or start a

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,320
discussion

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,200
in the forums and this will yeah give

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,720
some fire give some life to the project

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,400
and therefore help it out

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,160
if you can and if you feel like you're

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,960
proficient enough

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,640
with the software you can also try to

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
help out others with their problems

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,320
everyone started somewhere and

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,160
everyone's asking questions

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,559
and maybe you know the answer to some

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,880
and help them out

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,039
our forum you can find at

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,080
community.isinga.com

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,679
i will give you a quick overview so this

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,919
is what it looks like to a

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,679
user that is already logged in so that's

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,919
me

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,640
if you're new they're going to be some

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,080
pinned topics here on how to get started

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,960
in the forum

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,120
um commonly asked questions and also a

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
bit on how to contribute you can look

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,880
through different categories that we

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,720
have here

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,160
and just find something that you think

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
might know something about

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,360
so feel free to just hop into a forum

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,000
and contribute by asking or answering

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,000
questions

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,120
and the last thing i want to talk about

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,160
is

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,240
how to help out the developers

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,919
without actually contributing to the

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,600
code or

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:49,440
editing the repositories directly

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,400
and that first point testing software

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,400
is important and even though pretty much

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,200
everyone tests their software in some

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,840
way

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,480
and we have pretty good test coverage

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,799
for our repositories

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
there might always be something new that

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,240
slips through

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,200
nothing's perfect no testing is perfect

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,720
so

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,640
if you find a bug if you find something

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,039
that you think is going wrong or not

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,640
working as intended

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,320
it's always cool to tell the developers

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,720
about it

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,600
so check out new versions better

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
versions

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,520
some releases that you found you don't

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,280
have to run them on your live

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,520
environment you can just set up a little

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,559
development testing environment for

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,600
yourself

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,600
and check out new features and just

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,080
see if you find something and then write

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,159
up a github issue for example

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,400
or if you think there are security

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,960
issues you can contact

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
most any project on their own website

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,080
there's probably going to be

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
a separate thing for security issues

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,120
that you think you might have found

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,520
to you know not open up publicly about

00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,799
security issues

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,360
um and they will probably be very

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,919
thankful

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,919
for any kind of bug report that you are

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,640
bringing up

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,679
but even better than just any bug report

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,360
is writing a

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:17,679
good book report so you should probably

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:21,520
try to get to know how to do that

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,799
so what we have in our

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,120
repositories here is issue templates

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,240
that

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,120
help you structure your work report so

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,159
if i click on

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,000
new issue here in our repository issues

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
there are going to be three different

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,240
things suggested

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,280
one is report a bug

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,000
request a feature and there's also

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,240
a point that says ask a question where

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,559
it directs you to the forum

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
but let's say you want to report a bug

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,640
you can click on

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,080
get started and it will give you a nice

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
little template for it

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,000
and this template doesn't only um

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,080
yeah hell or doesn't only apply to a

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,200
singer but also to other

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,280
projects that you could use it for so

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
you should start off with describing the

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,520
book so

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
give a description of what you think is

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,840
going wrong

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,400
um try to look for troubling

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,799
troubleshooting guidelines first so

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
we have a documentation chapter about

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,520
that but there might be other

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,400
troubleshooting guides for other

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,559
projects

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,960
that you could find on their websites or

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,159
in their git repository

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,880
and if you don't find the issue that you

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,080
have in the troubleshooting guides

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,799
try to describe how to reproduce the bug

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,080
that you found so what steps did lead to

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,000
the bug showing up

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,799
was it just clicking around in the web

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,919
interface and it suddenly comes up or

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,720
can you figure out how to effectively

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
reproduce the bug every single time it

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,000
appears

00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,400
this might help the developers a lot and

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,039
try to note every single step you took

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,320
to get

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,400
to experiencing the bug

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,480
try to describe what the expected

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,720
behavior was

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:15,840
so look at what you think should happen

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,440
i mean sometimes behavior that looks

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,360
like a bug

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,240
might be intended but oftentimes

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,520
it's not and you should describe what

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,000
you think

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,080
could happen or should happen so the

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,480
developers can better gorg

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,679
whether you're just misinterpreting a

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,440
feature maybe

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,840
or whether it's actually a discrepancy

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
add screenshots screenshots are always

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,840
great because

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,960
it helps assure that what you're saying

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,159
is factually correct as well so

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,080
if someone can submit a screenshot there

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,240
might be details in it that

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,600
the person overlooked in the first place

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,679
and they just didn't

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,480
think of mentioning and the developer

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,799
can maybe see more in it

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
and of course describe your environment

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,919
as detailed as possible

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,880
so in our case describe the singer 2

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,799
version

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
describe the operating system you're

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
using maybe the browser if you're in the

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,200
web

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,000
enabled features web versions just

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
try to include everything that you think

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
might relate to the problem

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,360
and also some things that might not

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,159
relate to the problem and if you've got

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,440
any logs

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
that describe what happens or that

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
popped up around the time maybe just

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,320
include those as well it's a lot easier

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,600
to just

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,039
filter out things that you don't need

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,559
instead of asking for it so if someone

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,880
reports a book that is just three

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,679
sentences hey yo this is broken

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
help me fix it the developer has to ask

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,520
a thousand

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,200
questions which are a lot of effort to

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,520
put in into a bug that you

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
don't even know whether it's actually a

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
bug or not

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,799
if you start off with saying like

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,440
stating a lot of different facts and

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,279
just

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,880
over sharing information it's a lot

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,000
easier to just ignore the things that

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,400
you don't need

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,840
so include anything and everything

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,559
additional context

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,559
anything that relates to the bug just

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,919
throw it out there it's easier to ignore

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,480
stuff that you don't need

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,039
and to ask for stuff that you do need

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,039
all the time

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,480
so you've written your good bug report

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,840
and you've made the project a better one

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,080
by letting the developers know

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,960
um if you've got any other ideas on how

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,159
to contribute

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,559
please feel free to um discuss it with

00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,400
me

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,000
and there's probably going to be a chat

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,840
so in the chat

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,400

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,159

singer but any project is a good project

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,360
