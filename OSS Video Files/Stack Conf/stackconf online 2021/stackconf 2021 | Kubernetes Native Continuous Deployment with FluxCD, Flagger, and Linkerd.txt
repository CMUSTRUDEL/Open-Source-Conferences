	by Or Elimelech  and Leonid Belkind

With many services going online that have rapidly growing user bases plus the expectation of being both resilient and innovative at the same time, continuous delivery has become a necessary practice. By employing practices like automated gating, CD helps organizations grow with confidence, and limit (or completely circumvent) having to wait for manual checks and approvals.
This talk will discuss and demonstrate a Kubernetes native CD pipeline using FluxCD, Flagger and Linkerd. I will discuss the benefits we gained in the process of employing this pipeline at StackPulse.Three key learnings audience will take away from the session:

- How to increase velocity and deployment safety by adopting CD
- How great tooling can reflect your culture â€” not change it
