	by Peter Elmer

The value of Machine Learning researching malware is as important as the human experience. This presentation outlines why Data Driven Security is more effective than traditional research methodologies, as it combines data, human experience and logic made by machines to define the verdict. The audience is exposed to the background, why logic created by Machine Learning algorithms is defined ‘optimal’, in the sense of a mathematical reflection of the data and labels collected over time.
