Description: 
	by Peter Elmer

The value of Machine Learning researching malware is as important as the human experience. This presentation outlines why Data Driven Security is more effective than traditional research methodologies, as it combines data, human experience and logic made by machines to define the verdict. The audience is exposed to the background, why logic created by Machine Learning algorithms is defined â€˜optimalâ€™, in the sense of a mathematical reflection of the data and labels collected over time.

[Applause]

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,599
[Music]

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,000
thank you

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,400
for having me at stacconf 2021

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,760
in this presentation i will introduce

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,960
you the concept of data driven security

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,640
where machine learning powered by humans

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,840
is helping to prevent cyber security

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
attacks

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,920
my name is peter elmer i'm working as a

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,320
security expert at

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,960
checkpoint software technologies and i'm

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,760
part of

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:48,960
team of the cto

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,879
so today we look at the need for

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,079
data-driven security

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,719
the methods that are using and

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,120
the value of machine learning powered by

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,640
human experience

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,320
and we look at the effectiveness

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,320
of these solutions

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,439
short word important it is

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,040
to collaborate to share experience

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,200
and to centralize the intelligence to

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,560
distribute then the intelligence

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,119
to update and to make sure that

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,600
the experience of all members of the

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,880
team are confluencing

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,759
into the project into the team effort

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
into

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,840
what you are doing on a day-to-day basis

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
a sentence from our data scientists

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
theme is that

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,680
important decision points are taken

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,640
by machines with logic created

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,640
from data

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,799
the logic created from data and machine

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,520
learning

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,000
kind of complicated things and i try to

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
get an easy entry here

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
and i talk about something that i like

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
that is close to my heart and this is

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,200
apples

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,920
why apples because in the area of

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,000
frankfurt apples are very important

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,440
because you can make two things

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,840
apple pie and you can make apple wine

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,800
so cider so if we apply this concept to

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
machine learning

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,480
let's look at it we have features and

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,200
labels

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,280
so the feature is the result that we

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
want to achieve we want to achieve

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,640
on the one side an apple pie on the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,080
other side we want to achieve apple wine

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,800
so we need to decide we need to know

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
which are the features that make an

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,720
apple

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,239
good to be used in an apple pie and

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,760
which are the features that are more um

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
good to become apple wine so there are

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,319
features

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:06,800
we can touch we can look at we can smell

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:10,879
and there are features that we

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,280
use we experience but then unfortunately

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,560
it makes something different it changes

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,040
the data

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
so we have features where data remains

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,959
and we have features

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,280
where data is getting destroyed and

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,799
the difference between applied machine

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,519
learning in one way or

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,840
in the other way is the human

00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,319
experiences

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
that is driving the selection of

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,519
features

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,879
which characteristics are we assigning

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,640
for predicting a result for predicting

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,120
the machine learning result the label

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,280
and this is the human experience which

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,799
is making the difference

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,280
so in our site we have 27 years of

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,959
experience in cyber security

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,000
we have a enormous amount of data

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,280
label data that we know the result in

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,680
our database

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,599
and this is what we are using when we

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,080
apply the machine learning

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,080
to prevent security attacks

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,519
but i use the word predicting and

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,799
predicting is when we work in technology

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,320
always something well

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,000
we didn't want to predict we want to

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
know must be

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,600
clear 100 clear

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
unfortunately machine learning always

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
goes along

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
with a little bit of predicting so if we

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
compare it

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,639
with the traditional way of programming

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,000
even if we be honest to ourselves

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,440
there is something quite

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,919
a bit characteristics

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,240
conceptions assumptions when we create a

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,360
program we create a program on our best

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600
intentions

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,080
with the best assumptions with what we

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,960
know context and then we create the

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
logic

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,199
and then we feed data into the logic and

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,520
we get always a deterministic result

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,320
so in machine learning things are

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
different

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,479
in machine learning we have a machine

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
learning algorithm

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,280
we give data to this algorithm

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,240
and we know the result how the data

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,000
needs to be look like at the end and

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
then the machine learning algorithm is

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,759
giving us the logic

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,560
to treat the data to handle the data

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,160
then we are using new data where we

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,880
don't know the result

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,639
and then the program the logic the

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,240
machine learning logic

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,919
is giving us a probabilistic result

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:46,639
a result with a good probabilistic

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,639
to be as we expect it to be

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,280
but do we like probabilistic results

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
so we would like to drive everything

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,759
from

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,199
probabilistic to be deterministic

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,080
how can we achieve this

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,520
we can achieve it by understanding what

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,160
is making

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
something different what is changing

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
something to be there

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:20,000
and to be then on the other side or to

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:23,360
change its characteristics

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:27,280
and we know that the more data we have

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,880
the more data we feed into the logic

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,639
this will increase the accuracy

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,919
so the more data we have then more

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
we have the ability to become from

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,479
probabilistic

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
to deterministic

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,080
we have limited resources

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,720
so this is a fact we need to accept

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,560
we can't change it because it is limited

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,280
everything is limited

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
and the on the other side in cyber

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
security

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,160
we see that the attack surface is always

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
increasing

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
now since more than a year we all most

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
of us

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,680
many of us work from home we work with

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,319
multiple devices

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
we access multiple services some hosted

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,960
in a data center some hosted in the

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,560
cloud

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,919
some consumed as a function temporary

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,880
existing and all this is increasing

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,080
the attack surface and as we read every

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,520
day in the press

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,280
unfortunately even in many cases very

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,919
successfully

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,680
for the attackers unsuccessful and bad

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,680
for us as we are on the other side

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,400
so we need to accept that

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,160
it is unfortunately easier to attack

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,879
than to defend

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,840
it's not really hard to go out to the uh

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,599
dark net

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,000
or even in on google to to find attack

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,440
tools to find methodologies that you

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
can reuse or you can even find someone

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,319
who is doing it for you

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,360
there are attackers for rent hackers for

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,240
rent

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,280
as long as you pay they give you a

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,599
result that you would like to achieve

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,800
so attackers have an intent then they

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,800
have an idea

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,039
they have a plan they design a logic

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
they write create source code they

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,520
compile it

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,720
and then the stream of bits is sent

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,279
against the victim so this is the

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,959
process

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,919
and the surface at the end of the

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,760
process

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:45,519
is huge a stream of bits really

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,640
a complex thing to be dealt with

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,240
so what if we would

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:56,080
the effort of

00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:00,640
defending reduce what if

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,279
we could capture the intent

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,360
of the attacker that would be a cool

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,680
thing to be achieved

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,240
understanding the intent instead of

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,080
understanding that this is an attack by

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
looking at the stream of bits

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,720
by working on all the huge attack

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
surface

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,760
how can we achieve that understanding

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
the intent

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
complicated well and we need to respect

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
that we need to optimize our resources

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,080
because

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:39,360
they are limited

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
fortunately what we found out in our

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,920
research

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,680
is that when we apply machine learning

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,760
we take eight times less resources

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:56,480
than for for example preparing the data

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,480
decompiling an executable file

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,640
breaking apart a complicated

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
office document to understand if there

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,360
are macro elements and if there are

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,440
macro elements

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,640
to understand their consistency what

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,000
they are what they are doing

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,600
so we know from experience that when we

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
apply machine learning

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,920
we are more efficient we can achieve

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,839
more with less resources

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,320
this is why data driven security

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,800
is such an important area in the

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,720
research

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,279
and if we apply a mathematical

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,399
representation

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,880
everything becomes really easy not

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,000
really for me i'm not a mathematician

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
but my wife is a mathematician she helps

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
a doctor

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,120
our data scientists colleagues in the

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,240
team are all mathematicians

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,959
so i can work with them trust them and

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,279
then

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,959
we achieve in and the team a result

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,320
because they found mathematical

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,240
representations

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,360
and they found methodologies to abstract

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,839
the complexity they see in attack

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,839
schemes

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,440
so how can we understand this what

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,519
we are doing is we change representation

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,480
and by changing a representation we can

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,720
look at the example of a vgg-16

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:28,000
convolutional network element

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,680
so the vgg16 can

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:37,360
transform an image into

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,360
a vector into a stream of numbers

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,720
and there are now

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,000
models existing that allow

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:53,440
to predict pictures

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,440
with an accuracy of 92.7

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,480
so if we feed enough data into

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,839
a machine learning model we can achieve

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
to create a logic that is with 92

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,320
percent

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
accurate and one of the latest

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,600
applications for this

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,959
i've just seen it in a paper from intel

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,560
where this technology is applied

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,160
in enhancing the image quality

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,680
of a game so on the left side you see

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,399
the original

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,320
and on the right side you see the

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,320
enhanced

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:40,320
animation and what the team did at intel

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,880
they feeded 5000 photos from the

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,880
cityscapes

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,320
dataset into a vgg16 model

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,440
and combined it with the

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,519
information created by the

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,200
game and this is achieving a very

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,680
realistic photorealistic experience

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
i recommend you to search for this

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,959
article there is a very nice

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,120
video created by the team which uh

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,320
gives a good introduction into this

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,920
technology

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:20,800
and it's presenting in a very

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,560
nice way the result that they achieved

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,079
another example is vectorizing

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,760
so vectorizing human language

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,000
something that we are kind of using

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,360
every day every day we are using our

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,360
text to speech

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,399
speech to text um

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,920
functionalities on our mobile devices on

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,040
our computer so

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,160
what is behind it if we look at words

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,320
like king and queen or man and woman

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
we can try to understand what makes the

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,079
difference

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,720
what is changing one word to become

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,600
another

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,399
and then we can describe this change in

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,160
a vector

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,440
for example masculinity or of course

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,279
femininity so if we then look

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,320
at a vector we can even apply it

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,360
to term so

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,760
swimming and swamp walking and walked

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
so we have another vector which is verb

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,079
tense

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,120
and we can then create

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,399
word algebra because vectors

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,519
are numbers and so we have

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,920
algebra algebra is applicable to machine

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,920
learning

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,959
and of course a vector is an abstraction

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,199
level

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,000
because it is giving us not only the

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,959
number and

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,480
either and it is giving us a direction

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,519
so we have two

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,800
dimensions represented in one thing

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
so we abstract and can simplify in this

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
way

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,040
one of the applications for

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,880
vectorizing is the natural language

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,160
processing

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,199
in this way this is the model that is

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,839
behind the text to speech logic that we

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,120
are using

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,639
every day and i found that article that

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,199
was recommended by my

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
colleagues where you can get more

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,560
information what is behind

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:26,560
an lnp model so why is nlp useful

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,560
we know for example that if we

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
look at the sentence pineapples are

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,079
spiky and yellow

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,360
we can use nlp if we have just the input

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,320
final puts r

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,279
and yellow nlp will give us the output

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,880
that is missing

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:46,560
spikey but we can even

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,440
turn it around we can have

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,320
just one element and then predict the

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,680
output

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,880
and this is what thomas nikolov

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,839
has together with the colleagues

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,839
described in this white pepper that i'm

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,759
indicating here

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:09,839
where you use nlp

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:13,519
for describing the distribution

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:16,320
and representation of words and phrases

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,800
so what we are chasing in cyber security

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,839
is what is making the difference

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,199
how can we find out if something has a

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,959
malicious

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:32,480
or a benign intent

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:36,880
if we look at vectorizing if we look at

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,600
words we understand that

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
we see the same behavior the same

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,279
structure

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:49,120
when we look at api calls api calls

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:52,320
executed by an executional

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,959
program when it is running when we are

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,240
running

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:59,199
such an executor program in a well

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,920
observed environment called sandboxing

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,319
we can make a list we can document what

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,000
it is doing

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,280
so we understand the api

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,480
calls their sequence

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,000
the frequency the amount of times it is

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,520
occurring

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,839
and the

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,360
order in which they are executed

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,039
and if we then apply an algorithm that

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,320
is giving us

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,600
a hint of reducing

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:40,559
background like background noise words

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:44,240
like a to what and

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,679
then we understand from all these api

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
calls

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,200
what is really important here which are

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,640
the api

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,240
calls that are

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,600
used in this executes the file that make

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,240
a difference the difference between

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:07,360
a b9 and a malicious behavior

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,640
another element that is always present

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,280
in code is sequence

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
and sequence always has a meaning it

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
makes a difference

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,280
what you do first and what you do second

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,440
so even this is something that we

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
analyze in our logic

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,240
when we look at things that could be

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,799
malicious

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,039
and we then change the representation

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,200
using vgg16

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,480
neural networks so we take the input

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,600
of raw streams we break it

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,240
into vectors

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,320
and then we have an abstracted

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,600
representation of the original data

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,640
that we can deal with so

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,240
what is now the outcome of it

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,280
why is all this useful or was it just

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,200
nice theory we are using

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,480
these elements these machine learning

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,600
techniques

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,600
when we analyze executable files in our

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,720
sandboxing environment

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,919
so what you see here every gray box is a

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,520
machine

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,400
learning logic so first

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,080
we do disassembling we understand the

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,200
entropy the structure

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,919
of the file we then check

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,559
which file activities or registry

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,960
entries

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,840
are changed and we look for similarities

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,000
and of course we do verification of all

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,760
the resources that are accessed

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,880
outside in the internet

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,000
and we create in this phase metadata

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,160
abstraction data and we feed this

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,640
metadata into a second

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,960
machine learning logic which is then

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,320
giving us a classification

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,280
if this is benign or malicious when it

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,640
comes to

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,919
office documents so pdf doc

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,440
exercise powerpoint we apply

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:15,520
again machine learning logic specified

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:19,120
specialized for this kind of data

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,720
and we reuse what we know from

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,080
the executables we reuse the logic for

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,640
url verification by the way this logic

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,080
is used in many of our solutions

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,360
even for a zero phishing solution that

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,159
we are just now

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,159
presenting to the market so

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,679
machine learning is used in many places

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,880
and it's used in two phases we create

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,919
metadata

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,720
and then we again apply a second

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,039
machine learning step to the metadata to

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,799
get

00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:03,360
the verdict and what is the advantage

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:06,880
sometimes we can be fast

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,400
last year 25 20th of july

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,600
we identified a malicious executable

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,720
file

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,200
we checked on virustotal.com who else

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,559
has

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,080
seen this and the file was

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,240
in the sandbox environment

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,919
before it could execute its malicious

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,120
intent it was blocked

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,840
by the machine learning logic

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,400
we then allowed it to run and it was in

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,919
fact

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,080
malicious it was a ransomware so what we

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,679
then did is we observed how long

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,600
would it take for the others to find it

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,760
of course customers who used the

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,880
technology that we are

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,240
producing have been prevented

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,400
for this technology and then we

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
shared our finding and we found that it

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,679
took others

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,679
four days to understand

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,799
that this is a malicious file so sharing

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,039
experience

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,840
is a key element we share our findings

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
with others it's a public site you don't

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,480
need

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:23,520
registrations and you can find tools

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,720
that you can use in cyber security

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,280
we publish on a regular basis our

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,320
findings

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:36,640
for example when we

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,919
apply the logic to understand the dna

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,880
of the malware we want to understand the

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,360
dna of a malware because it allows us to

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,679
put it into a family and we found with

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,559
all the malware that we have

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,880
using a 300 000 dimensional

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,480
representation model

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,880
that there are families there are

00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,919
commonalities

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,280
and if we know the family then we know

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,480
which technique we can apply to

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,159
defend it and

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,039
this work was

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,799
performed even in a specific case with a

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,200
close collaboration

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:22,400
with antesa where we mapped out

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,640
the malware dna of an advanced

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,559
persistence attack ecosystem we wanted

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
to understand what stands behind this

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,120
ecosystem

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,240
and we identified that that ecosystem is

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,520
state driven and

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,799
that the state is founding multiple

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,360
teams

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,240
every team is working isolated from each

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,880
other

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,720
trying to achieve the same result it's

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,080
an interesting concept

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,000
of redundancy

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,919
because if the work of one team is

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
disclosed and prevented

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,120
you have good chances that the other two

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:04,320
teams are still successful

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,559
so we identified that really the actors

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,320
didn't share any code

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:15,039
they worked in parallel

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:20,320
and that we found about 60 families

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,320
in what these teams have been producing

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,240
and one of the most dramatic attacks

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
recently has been the

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,799
the sunburst attack that we all know

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,679
about where

00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:37,120
unfortunately a chain

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,960
of supply software

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,159
was compromised and

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,360
a lot of companies have been victim to

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,400
this attack

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,720
and the attack was um yeah utilizing the

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,240
trust relationship between on-premises

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,360
active directory

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,840
and cloud-driven directory structures

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,039
from

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,039
from azure and

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,760
it is unfortunately something that has

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,480
been observed quite a lot and where we

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,200
are

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,799
very actively monitoring what is

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,080
happening here

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,279
to understand and to defend and prevent

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,279
similar attacks

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:24,799
and one of the most recent

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:28,640
that um yeah down

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:32,720
putting down the the pipeline in in us

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,720
and after the team has been

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:42,640
paid or actually got got money

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:45,919
fortunately the team could be kind of

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,559
hit back some of the money that they

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
received could then be taken away and

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,400
the team

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,919
publicly declared that they are now

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,480
out of business of course we need to to

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,960
see

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,559
for how long and how this is going to

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
continue but

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,360
this is the unfortunate reality that we

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,360
are living in

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,240
so this is why we put such a great

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,279
effort in understanding the dna of the

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,559
malware

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,440
to attribute the family characteristics

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,640
to it

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,200
in order to be able to apply

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:26,240
the relevant defense techniques

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
because then we save our precious

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,679
element

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,679
the resources

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:37,120
so what's next if we

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:41,120
observe the new

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:44,880
are nlp trained models the

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,880
gpt3 for example

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,400
it has a very impressive

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,960
set of capabilities compared to

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,279
everything that was known earlier

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,120
if you look at some of the videos the

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,880
link that i'm posting here is a video

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,480
where 14 applications

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,360
using these this machine learning logic

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
are introduced and explained it's really

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,640
impressive

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,080
with how you can

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,200
just with natural wording create a

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,559
website

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:24,640
create programs

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:28,880
so recapturing the machine learning

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:33,039
is empowering us to prevent attacks

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:38,399
and it is important to have experience

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:41,840
and data then you can apply the label

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,240
you can select the right features

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,320
and then you are able to create the

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,360
machine learning algorithms

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,480
that then are

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,720
available to you to

00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:02,000
identify unknown malware and to prevent

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,399
attacks not known before

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
this is of course not something that we

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,799
do once

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,080
and then we relax we need

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,320
to apply it every day we need to apply

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,720
it

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:21,919
in an infinitive circle we start

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:25,760
with a decision point federated learning

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,880
using data from our customers in an

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,760
anonymous way so that we do not

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,320
disclose any customer related data

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,960
we then label some of the labeling is

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,840
supervised by humans

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,720
we train the machine we adjust the

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,760
weighting

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,520
then we measure the result on unseen

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,760
data

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:57,120
and then we put it into production

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,760
to just then have the circle starting

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,679
again

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,720
a continuous circle of learning

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,760
of improving adjusting weights

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,559
and then measuring again every day

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,760
from the morning to the evening and even

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,120
throughout the night

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,120
if something bad is happening

00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,880
so machine learning is nothing without

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,039
the human experience

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,240
and we try to contribute our part

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,640
to make this a little bit safer

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,919
this environment this planet that we

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,200
have

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,440
and this circle is giving us even

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,640
motivation then whenever we find

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,240
a new attack we prevented something that

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,559
was unseen before

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,600
we share it with the rest of the

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,080
community

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,760
we feel a little bit proud on it and we

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,279
know that the others will start

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,559
to tweak their tools to get better again

00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,480
but we get up again and do

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,559
our job that we are used to do

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,520
i thank you for your attention i hope it

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,919
was a little bit

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,799
entertaining and has given you some new

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,279
thoughts

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,279
enjoy the rest of the show thank you and

00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:23,840
[Music]

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
goodbye
