Title: stackconf 2021 | The Tyranny of Taylorism and how to spot Agile BS
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: stackconf online 2021
Description: 
	by Martin Hinshelwood

Even those that developed and industrialised waterfall no longer believe it has value, and they still struggle with the tyranny of Taylorism. While 81% of all development shops say that they are adopting agile, the reality is far from it; only 22% do short iterations, 16% have ordered backlogs, & 13% do retrospectives! They still lack feedback loops. This talk will take a walk through history from 1890 through to the present and follow the rise and eventual fall of Waterfall in the very organisation that developed it; the US Military-Industrial Complex. From communities through the industrial revolution, mechanisation of the workforce, the first MBA’s, the pursuit of hierarchical plan-driven solutions, and bureaucracy to the realisation of reality and the struggle to change.

Overview:
1880 – Social, Family, Community, Problem Solving
1890 – Industrial Revolution and mechanisation of the workforce
1906 – First MBA and enshrinement of the carrot and the stick
1920 – First ideas that people are different ridiculed
1950 – Sequential work adopted by US Military
1970 – Waterfall designed and adopted
1993 – First Scrum Project
2001 – Agile Manifesto
2010 – Consultation on new DOD procurement rules
2013 – New Procurement rules mandating iterative delivery go live
2018 – Detecting Agile BS
2019 – USAF Memo

Future – Social, Family, Community, Problem Solving

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,480
hi

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,439
my name's martin hinchowitz i run at

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,080
naked ability

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,880
in scotland i'm a professional scrum

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,800
trainer

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,320
with scrum.org professional kanban

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
trainer with pro kanban

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
and i've been a microsoft mvp in devops

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,000
for about 13 years

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
i'd like to take talk a little bit about

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,320
the

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,920
tyranny of taylorism and how to detect

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,520
agile bs um i'm probably gonna i'm gonna

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,920
start with some data

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,360
to show why i think there's a problem

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,320
and then in the middle we're going to go

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
back in time

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,559
and see what the problem is

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,120
and then we're going to look at how do

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
we

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,239
maybe measure that problem how do we how

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,239
do we figure out whether

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,840
uh companies are lying to us whether

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,280
they be our vendors

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,560
or we want to go work for them or

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,880
we're just lying to ourselves maybe okay

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,040
so maybe we can tell the difference

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,640
i'd like to thank statcom for the

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,280
opportunity to talk to you

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,640
please feel free uh to post any

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,640
questions in the chat

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,119
uh i should be there already uh

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,799
and if you can't find me in the chat or

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,840
i don't have time to answer your

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
question

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,960
please message me on twitter or

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,960
linkedin it's up to you okay

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,439
i did promise you a little bit of data

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
uh this data here is from

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,159
forrester uh research 2017.

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,759
um there's probably more up-to-date

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,079
versions of this and you can go look for

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,360
it

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,759
yourselves uh but the assertion here

00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:01,600
is that 81 of all software development

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:06,000
shops teams orgs say that they are

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,119
agile and aside as of that about 80

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,160
say that they're um also say they're

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,080
doing scrum

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,879
okay so 80 scrum 80 agile

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
and uh that last 10 percent is maybe

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,440
doing waterfall

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,800
right but i would like to assert

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,400
that almost 80 of them are lying

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,319
right they're they're feeding us a

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
little bit of agile bs

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
um and i'd like to get to the bottom of

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,400
it and let me

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,599
let me validate that and say why i think

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,840
almost 81

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,959
of them are lying um first off

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,280
only 22 um

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
of these organizations claim to be doing

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
short iterations

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
right and that's iterations of one month

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
or less

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
not doing short iterations not doing

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
agile that's

00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,200
pretty much how that rolls uh 16

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,840
don't have ordered backlogs right

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,440
if you're not if you don't have an order

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,720
backlog you don't have

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,640
an understanding of the value and the

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,599
queue of value that you're delivering

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
i don't see how you can be optimizing

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,280
that flow of value

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,840
failing fast if you don't have an order

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
backlog

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,280
uh only 13 do retrospectives this one i

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,280
don't get that's kind of fundamental

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
uh to the inspect and adapt look you

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
can't create an empirical process

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
control system

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,440
uh you can't adapt going forward into

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,599
the future unless you're doing some form

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
of retrospectives it doesn't have to be

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,879
the scrum retrospective that's once

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
every two weeks

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,920
but it does have to be some form of

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,319
review of how we're working and adapting

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,319
what we're going to go do next

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,440
if you want to take a look and dive into

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,879
the data yourself

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,480
uh you can see there mvps minimum viable

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,760
products but five percent

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,360
uh peer programming 15 daily stand-ups

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,239
only 21 add this all together

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,400
and i believe that very few

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
organizations very few teams

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,720
um are are are really doing agile even

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
though they say they are

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,720
um and when i was putting this

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,359
presentation together um i searched on

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,560
the the internet and i found this

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,280
post from brian wang um

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,080
i've used it a couple of times but i

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,199
think it's true

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,800
i think most organizations pretend they

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
look awesome

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,600
and and really they're not they're

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,160
they're just good at hiding it

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,040
banks are a good example most people i

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,360
know

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
that you know have a bank account and

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,919
use banking services

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,919
think that banks are are doing okay uh

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
but any of you out there including

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
myself who have actually worked in a

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,919
bank

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
will know that brian wang's comment

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,639
holds true there it's

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,600
it's not good it's not what you think it

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,720
is

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,280
um and this is a real struggle okay

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,440
so i guess the question is why is it so

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,560
hard to do something different

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,360
right if the the existing

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
situation and tools is not working for

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,680
us

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,360
um why are we still

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
doing it that way isn't that the very

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,880
definition of insanity to keep doing the

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
same thing

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,080
over and over again expecting a

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,720
different result when when how

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
we don't get that different result so a

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
lot of this

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,919
it stems and i i don't like to use the

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,800
term waterfall very often because for me

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,759
waterfall is

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,039
is just a symptom it's the tip of the

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,560
iceberg

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,039
um taylorism is the real problem

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,000
that we are trying to combat taylorism

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
is the thing

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
uh that is getting in our way um and

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
it's where

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
this uh little graph here came from

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,600
where

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,039
we have uh requirements design

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,400
implementation verification and

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
maintenance

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,000
right where did this idea come from in

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,240
the first place

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,520
i would assert that even this is just a

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
symptom

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,160
we have in organizations we often have

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,039
hierarchies and we have departments and

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,240
departments hand off work to each other

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,759
and it's exactly the same as

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
requirements design implementation

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,319
verification and maintenance we might

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,440
have a a

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,520
sales team a contracts team uh

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,479
a legal team and they're all kept

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,400
separate

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
not allowed to talk to each other except

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,400
through approved

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,240
procedures and channels okay so why do

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,960
we work this way where did this

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
where did this stuff come from um well

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,680
i'd

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
like to do a little bit of time travel

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,000
here and we're going to go back in time

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
130 years

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,240
um and prior to the industrial

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,440
revolution

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,120
uh manufacturing took place at or

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,440
near the home in small workshops

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
compensation uh came through earned

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,319
value and was based on how well

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
a person made a product or how useful it

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,520
was to the

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,039
purchaser okay in other words there was

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
purpose to people's work

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,400
mastery enabled by the master and

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,400
apprentice system

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
ensuring that quality was passed down

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,560
through the generations

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
people could choose to work hard and

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
well

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,919
or get better at what they did and their

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,639
application of the same would often

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,960
manifest it as either increased wealth

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
right or greater time to pursue other

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,520
interests

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
as people spend a lot more time with

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,240
their their families back then or

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,759
worked hard depending on how you get it

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,599
then the industrial revolution

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,440
came along and during the industrial

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,400
revolution the world

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
changed tremendously very quickly we

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,280
need to scale up

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,000
production uh of uh tools of our

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,919
work of our output we knew what the

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,199
output was going to be

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,120
um so we ended up at wanting to automate

00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,680
a bunch of processes to make more

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
product

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
faster but we didn't have robots we

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,199
didn't have the technology

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
at the time so we had to use people we

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
had to mechanize

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,840
the workforce and here we have two

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,039
pictures

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,919
of people making something no idea what

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,720
they're making

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,680
uh this picture above me could be uh

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,879
clocks

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
um i guess i have no idea i'm not sure

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,879
that

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,599
uh this pair this person here

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,280
even cares what it is they're building i

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,080
don't think it matters to them

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,919
their job is very specifically to do

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,360
something with these little circles

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,800
and they don't have to do anything else

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,320
they don't have to know anything else

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
they don't have to care

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
about the customer they'd have to care

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,040
about anything the

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,240
outcomes were managed by leadership by

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,720
the organization

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,839
um they're just there to provide that

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
robot doing that particular task

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
on the left i've got no idea what

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
they're building that could be hubcaps

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,640
i don't know it doesn't matter and the

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,800
people there don't care

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,800
and that's part of the problem when you

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,120
see the difference between

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,279
these two worlds what happened

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
why is that such a disconnected

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,600
experience

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,640
on the right there and the biggest

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
impediment to value delivery was

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,000
identified as something called

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,800
a soldiering now this is this is a

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,279
not a term we use in this way anymore uh

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,440
but

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,440
it means to work more slowly than one's

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,880
capacity to loaf

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,600
or to maligner uh you will get various

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,800
things if you try and look them up

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,200
for your language but it's basically uh

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,399
this group of folks here they're workers

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
they're meant to be working

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,160
they're trying to avoid work yeah

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,920
because they don't care about the work

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,519
they just care about their paycheck that

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,200
is it um

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,560
so they they don't care so how do we how

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,600
do we manage these people how do we

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,800
figure out how to

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,560
uh get them get more out of them well

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,480
frederick winston taylor came along he

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,320
was the thought leader at the time

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,480
and he came up with this this statement

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
when i which i think still rings true

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,959
today for many

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,360
uh managers right people managing

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,560
other people treating them as resources

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,640
they believe

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,720
that hardly a competent worker can be

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
found who does not devote a considerable

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
amount of time

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,880
to studying just how slowly they can

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,720
work

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,079
and still convince their employer

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,600
they're going at a good pace

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,000
there's almost a default assumption of

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,880
negative intent right our employees are

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
going to be lazy

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
they're untrustworthy therefore we have

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,760
to control them

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
and control them more um that that was

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,959
the mindset at the time

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,720
and frederick winston taylor came up

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,200
with the scientific

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
management method to help manage these

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,279
people

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
and what they did was they created

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,839
standard methods for performing each job

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
so everything's just to task in standard

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,600
and we're going to divide workers into

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,120
appropriate ability-based groups

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,640
right so we're going to have the people

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,920
that screw the

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,720
uh top on the toothpaste bottle on one

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,880
group

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,560
those that fill the toothpaste bottle in

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
another group and those that

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
i don't know attach the two sides of the

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
toothpaste bottle i don't know how that

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,320
works

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,079
uh in another group they don't have to

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
learn any other jobs they only have to

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
learn this one thing

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
that they have to do and they just have

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,600
to do it faster okay so that's

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,360
ability-based group and then we're going

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,079
to train them in just those standard

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,839
methods

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,040
they don't have to know anything else

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,040
we're going to we don't need them to

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
think that's a bad idea

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
thinking workers is a bad idea because

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,839
they're largely uneducated

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,839
don't have a lot of skills uh we've got

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
300 people waiting in the door to take

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,320
the next job that's available

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,720
so let's just plan everybody's work and

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
then we can treat people as resources

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,880
hire anybody to do any job and and fire

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,160
anybody

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,320
as soon as we don't think they're

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,959
performing well and get somebody else in

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,160
right that sounds like a good idea and

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,320
then if people

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,800
want to make a a i guess a living wage

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,600
we're gonna have wage incentives if they

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,720
work harder

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,839
or faster then um we're gonna we're

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,920
gonna

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
increase their salary give them like

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
bonus or something

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
following frederick winston taylor came

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
a gentleman who

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,120
you won't recognize okay uh but he is

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,880
henry gent you will recognize his

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,160
surname yes he came up with the gantt

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
chart

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,760
and he used scientific analysis to kind

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,440
of improve things and he created the

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,560
task and bonus system

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
right based on the idea that we should

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,360
pay people a basic wage based on

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,200
expected low performance

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
you as an employee are not going to

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,959
perform well therefore we will pay you

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,920
based on that low performance

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,279
and then if you meet or exceed uh

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,079
targets we give you

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,000
then you will get your your bonus and

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,440
get it up to a reasonable

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,360
wage so i'm going to pay you less than

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,040
you deserve or the less than you need

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,279
less than you are worth

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,519
and then your bonus brings it up to the

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
to the to the level that you need

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,880
and then your manager who has to

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,000
motivate you um

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,240
we're going to incentivize that manager

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,839
based on you meeting your targets so if

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,120
you don't meet your targets

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,920
your manager doesn't meet make his uh

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,000
bonus yeah it's going to take money away

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,200
from your manager if you do bad work

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,560
because that's a good idea okay uh and

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,639
indeed it's kind of

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,839
similar to the modern school system

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,720
right if you think about the modern

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,279
school system

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
uh uh reward for fulfilled tasks

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,760
everybody sits in rows

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,519
everybody has to do the same thing at

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,800
the same time no talking and incentive

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,120
based learning

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,560
now the gentlemen were not responsible

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
for the modern school system

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,800
but they definitely were interested in

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
perpetuating it

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,320
and as it was an ideal uh

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,839
world to create factory workers to

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,920
create people who

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,959
had just enough knowledge to exist in

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,160
society

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,320
be productive but uh not

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,920
questioned right because we don't want

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,639
robots questioning what's going on

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,880
that's that's

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,800
that's for another 100 years and then

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
we'll be in deep doo-doo

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,839
okay so what's the difference between

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
these two really

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,240
not a lot um school system kind of

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,240
trains you to be factory worker sorry

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,279
that's the way it was designed uh not

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
design that's not the way it was

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,440
designed but that's the way

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,079
reason it was uh uh perpetrated uh

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,519
on us and is kept to this day uh just

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,519
because it's hard to change stuff at

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,079
that level at that scale

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,279
um largely the education system is

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,800
glorified

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,920
uh um child care and there's no interest

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,720
in changing it to be anything else

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,040
so these two gentlemen uh they optimize

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
for

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,680
output okay not outcome because the

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,199
outcomes were known

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,720
we know exactly what it is we're going

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,160
to build we're going to build a clock

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,440
it's going to have this quality which

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,240
means these parts need to have this

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
precision

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,760
and we'll just make it and all of the

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,120
people involved in this process

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,399
are factory workers they're automatons

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,399
who we can replace widgets in a machine

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,399
that we can just get rid of and replace

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,920
so uh

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,959
this is the graduating class of harvard

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
in 1908 and this was the the leaders of

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,240
all of those

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
uh uh companies that started in sorry

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
the leaders the sons of all of the

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,600
people that owned

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
the the the the organizations at the

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
time

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,440
and then they went off around the world

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:32,160
to be managers to lead organizations

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:36,000
and taylorism spread from that point

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,440
in the 1950s this new way of working

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,199
emerged that was to become that term

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,800
waterfall that we know and love you can

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
see uh above the

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,240
the the same things that we're talking

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,399
about uh for the

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,800
the factory workers and and then the

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,240
largest purchaser in the world

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
took on this system thought it was a

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,600
good idea and that's the us military

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,639
complex

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,279
they have something like 2.8 million

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,480
full-time employees and a 700 billion

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,320
dollar budget

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,839
it's the largest spender in the world

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,320
largest buyer

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,000
and they because they made it part of

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,040
their procurement processes

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,120
and it just became part of their vendors

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
procurement processes and that kind of

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,560
trickled down to the rest of us which

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,920
kind of sucks

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,880
but then uh we started uh building

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,360
computers

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,360
uh building more complex things uh and

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
things did not go so well

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,160
they did not turn out uh like

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,880
we were expecting so what was the

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
problem

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,560
well in fact we needed something a

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,600
little bit different

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,800
okay when we are

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,560
um working in the

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,040
um if we

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
know everything up front we can work in

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,240
that plan

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,120
driven world where we can decide

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
everything

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
if the variance between how long we

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
expect something to take

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,759
and how long it actually takes is small

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,959
enough um

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,360
10 to 15 maybe then

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,640
we can plan the whole thing out and then

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,000
we can manage

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,079
for that inconsistency in the story

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,799
as we go where you know the variance is

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,000
small and but in the software world this

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,039
was the start of

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,240
the the greater knowledge working

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,120
world that that most people especially

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
all of you here

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,280
and especially anybody who works in an

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,799
office is really a knowledge worker

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,360
they're not a factory worker

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,960
yeah they need to use their brain to

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
solve problems every day

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,559
and suddenly the variance is not 10 to

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,520
15 percent

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,039
uh but 60 to 70 percent variance and

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,320
what you think the outcome is going to

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,000
be and what the actual

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,440
outcome is going to be any time you're

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
doing product discovery or product

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,440
delivery sorry product

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,360
discovery or product development uh then

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,640
you're going to end up in that

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,080
in that space and the old tools are no

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,360
longer valid

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,360
so in that uh predictive

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,840
world um we have at long term detailed

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,360
plans we can assign and control work

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,200
uh we can maximize capacity and effort

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,720
so we want to make sure that all of our

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,880
widgets in our machine all of our

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,799
machines in our factory are utilized

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,080
at their full capacity and we can work

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,320
to keep people

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,600
on that schedule that we built in the

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,160
gantt chart

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,880
um and then we can drive and manage it

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,600
all

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
with reports and meetings to figure out

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,960
how we're going to

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,679
fix problems and it's the manager's job

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,320
to go and

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,679
intervene and fix the problems we're

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
going to appoint a manager for the

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
project

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,880
and they're going to solve all of those

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,960
problems and if people don't

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
work hard or fast enough maybe we could

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
motivate them

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
by giving them more money or potentially

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,320
a better job title

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,360
right these are all practices that work

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,440
inside of that predictive world

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
but once we get that really high level

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
of variance

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,679
and it starts to break down it no longer

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,200
really works in that space and and we

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,080
need to do something differently

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,679
and above here is the empirical

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,360
management practices

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,280
that make sense when the variance is

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,559
high right we need to manage

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,120
risk differently so instead of

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,799
uh creating that plan keeping everybody

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,240
to it we accept that it's

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:30,400
you know our plan is crap right it's

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,280
60 to 70 unknowns so let's instead

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,919
set goals vision and direction and have

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,559
people

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,000
be smart enough organized enough to work

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,480
towards that

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
goal vision and direction we create an

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,440
environment within which that

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,960
in within which that works we get things

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,440
out of the way that are causing these

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,360
people problems from doing the work

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,600
they're the smart people that understand

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,919
the work rather than us the managers

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,120
they're the highly educated ones

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
who are solving the problems and

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,000
creating the

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,520
the things and then we need that

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
incremental feedback

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,760
right we need to deliver something

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,520
that's usable

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,960
so that the people that are going to be

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,679
using our products can

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,440
use it see what it's like and then give

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,720
us feedback and we change

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,280
and we create that feedback loop system

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,120
and the thing that really motivates

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,600
people in that world is not

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
uh money oh i keep doing it the wrong

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,919
way money

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
my arm disappears money and a job title

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,919
it's

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,039
autonomy mastery and purpose we want to

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,400
feel like

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,720
oh i'm opposites we want to feel like uh

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,960
we're in control of our own destiny that

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,919
we choose what and when we work on

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
uh we want to feel like we're good at

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,720
our job that we're

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
we're skilled that we're respected in

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
our profession and we want to feel like

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,240
the work that we do

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,679
matters so how do we do this how do we

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,640
know when an organization is doing well

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,799
in this space

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,880
well in fact there are some very large

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,440
organizations that have realized

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,480
uh that this is all a bad idea and isn't

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,520
going well

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,600
the biggest of which is the perpetrator

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
one of the perpetrators of why we're all

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,559
doing it this way and that's the us

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,919
department of defense

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:23,360
and they have released a white paper

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,559
which i love uh called detecting agile

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
bs

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,240
and i'll just read this small piece out

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,159
for you agile is the buzzword of

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
software development and so

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,640
all department of defense software

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,039
development projects are almost by

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,720
default declared to be agile

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
the purpose of this document is to

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,080
provide guidance to

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,960
all department of defense program

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,919
executives and acquisition professionals

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,320
on how to detect software projects that

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,120
are

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,000
really using agile development versus

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,360
those that are

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,640
simply waterfall or spiral development

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,720
in agile clothing

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,679
right so what are the tests that we're

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,000
going to use

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,200
now i would uh quite often do this as

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,720
interactive but we're not going to be

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
able to do that today

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,880
so what i would like you to do um is i

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,720
would like

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,280
you um all to

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,880
think about these as billion

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,799
propositions they are either

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,559
true or they're not if your answer is

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,280
maybe then it's not true okay

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,159
so i've got one two three four five six

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,640
questions

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,600
i'm going to ask you in the next five

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,760
minutes

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,120
and i'd like you to think about whether

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,880
your answer to this

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:42,320
is yes right and a resounding

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,400
yes absolutely yes we are doing that

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
okay so i'm gonna bring up each of these

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,600
six questions

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
and and you can you can answer them uh

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,559
yourself

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,320
i will not be able to get a poll but i

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,080
will be interested in your answers and

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,320
your outcome

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,280
our teams delivering working software

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,480
to at least some subset of real users

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
every iteration

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,840
including the first and gathering

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,600
feedback

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,039
that's our first question okay

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,120
are you hmm

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,720
that is interesting there's some

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,960
interesting words in there first one is

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
real users that does not mean

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,080
a test environment where your testers

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
get a hold of it it means

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,640
production right real users not fake

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,280
users real users

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,799
some subset of production it doesn't

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,240
have to be rolled out to everybody

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:36,159
but some subset of production and

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:41,200
gathering feedback if your answer is no

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,799
then i'm sorry we're not doing agile yet

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,799
okay this is this is a minimum

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,720
requirement especially for scrum scrum

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,400
absolutely mandates

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,000
that you deliver working software at

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,120
least every iteration to some

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,520
subset of real users okay delivery

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,600
uh is there a product charter that lays

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,919
out the strategic goals

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,880
do all members of the team understand

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,720
and are they

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:08,240
able to see how their work contributes

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,799
right that goes to that purpose idea

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,320
do the people doing the work understand

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,840
why they're doing the work what they're

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,120
trying to achieve how the thing

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,640
they do connects to that thing

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,760
because if the answer is no i'm sorry

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,760
but we're not doing agile

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,360
okay are teams empowered to change their

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,159
processes

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,840
based on what they learned right are

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,919
your teams able to change their

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,000
processes or do they have to follow

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,240
what the organization says they have to

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,960
follow where's your balance

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,440
of autonomy versus alignment right big

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,279
organizations have some rules

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,120
right that's okay but are they empowered

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,840
to change their processes based on what

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,679
they're learning

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,840
if they find out that something you've

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,279
told them to do in a certain way

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,679
is not going to work

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,799
do they have to still do it that way

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,840
because if they're not allowed to change

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,799
it

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,559
i'm sorry that's not agile these are

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,200
fundamental

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,880
is feedback from users turned into

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,360
concrete work items

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,320
for sprint teams on timelines shorter

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
than one month

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,679
do you have a tight feedback loop that's

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,679
at least one month

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,279
getting feedback from users updating

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,400
your work items delivering different

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,600
stuff

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,799
because if not again

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,039
i'm sorry just not agile

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
right

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,279
get two more are teams empowered to

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,240
change the requirements based

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,600
on user feedback right can you update

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,440
and change the requirements because

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,640
users tell you something about what it

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
is you've delivered and how they're

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,159
using it

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,360
right for that you have to be in b

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
access the

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,480
the users have to have access to the

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,080
real software

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,880
right because if not we're not agile and

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,240
then the

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,520
the piece the resistance the very last

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,000
one that i find

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,840
uh totally uh it kicks most of our asses

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,679
and means that we're not doing very good

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,039
agile is the full

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,720
ecosystem of our project agile agile

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,679
programming teams

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,960
followed by linear bureaucratic

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,320
deployment

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,039
is a failure right

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,799
are you as the engineering team in full

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,320
control of your ecosystem

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:33,600
there are no auditor audit

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,360
or uh compliance requirements from

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,200
external to your company

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,919
uh that don't allow you to be in control

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,960
of that space that don't allow you to

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,039
control

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,880
what happens in production right they

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,159
might restrict access to it

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,240
but you should be in control of that

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:57,760
because if not it's very difficult

00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,559
to claim agility right so for

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,000
all of your teams working in your

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,240
organization the answer should be a

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,840
resounding yes

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,559
these six questions are the high level

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,039
uh questions from that detecting agile

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,200
bs

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,039
article from the department of defense

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,960
uh i think they're a pretty good

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,279
litmus test these are the leadership

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,520
questions they also have

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,000
engineering questions in that white

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,000
paper so it's well worth the rate

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,720
and i email it to most of my customers

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,799
first uh communication i have with them

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,880
hoping that they'll have a little read

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,320
and maybe have a little bit of

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
realization

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,559
at dawn are we actually agile or are we

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,440
lying to ourselves is our journey

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,320
longer than we think it is that's okay

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
you don't have to do

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,440
everything at once you don't have to be

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,159
here

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,159
right in order to be successful

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,080
but it's going to be difficult to claim

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,480
that you're agile if these things are

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,679
not true

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,039
because ultimately even if you use

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,520
waterfall type measurements

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,440
traditional project management methods

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,760
using agile practices

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,960
projects are about 30 percent more

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,600
successful

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,880
with 32 percent of small projects being

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,279
more likely to succeed in

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,960
600 percent of large projects but the

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,320
average is about 30.

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,679
right 30 is a lot of money right that's

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,279
a lot of loss

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,120
and don't get uh bought into using

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,399
somebody else's process

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,000
neither of these two stories here are um

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:41,440
agile safe is most definitely not agile

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,679
and the spotify framework was

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,760
a white paper that demonstrated

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,159
spotify's position

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,679
at the time of the paper uh they are not

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,080
doing the same thing now

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,960
neither of these things are agile i'm

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,240
gonna leave you

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,559
uh with this us air force memo

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,440
has my one of my favorite statements in

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,240
it uh

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,399
highly discouraged from using rigid

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,600
prescriptive frameworks

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,080
such as safe and my

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,360
favorite comment down the bottom safe

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,399
isn't used by

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,480
any successful commercial

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,880
software organizations think about that

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,320
next time your organization is talking

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,360
about safe

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,600
and ultimately

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,600
devops and agile they're not magic

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,559
they're a new way of thinking a new way

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,120
of doing things

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,600
and it'll take you a long time to get

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,080
there

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,440
and all we need to be is on that journey

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,720
right making progress

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,600
one step at a time figure out what the

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
next

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,559
most important thing you can do in your

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,840
organization to take that next

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,520
step uh just take one more step

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,840
right keep moving forward

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,840
okay

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,440
thank you very much uh for for listening

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,559
if you have any questions uh please

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,760
message me in one of the options

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:23,830
i am looking forward to hearing from you

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:26,880
okay thank you very much
