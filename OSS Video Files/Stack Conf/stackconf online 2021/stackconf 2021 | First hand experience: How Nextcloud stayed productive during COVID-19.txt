Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: stackconf online 2021
Description: 
	by Frank Karlitschek

We are all now experiencing that remote working and virtual conferencing are important tools to stay connected. Not just in current circumstances but also in the wider future. That is why it is important to offer an easy-to-use, efficient, and quick replacement. Nextcloud is a platform for complete online collaboration and communication and can help to quickly adept and stay connected. Nextcloud is built by Nextcloud GmbH that has employees in home-offices in 11 countries and the Nextcloud Community which is spread all over the world. This talk gives an inside look at how Nextcloud GmbH works together with the Nextcloud community-building Nextcloud. It covers different communication channels that work for synchronous and asynchronous communication, how coordination in distributed teams works, and how good and efficient collaboration around documents is possible. Additionally, but also very important to share, this talk covers some of the challenges and solutions on how to successfully work across different countries, time zones, languages, and cultures.

state product is during copic 19

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,239
and how others did the same

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,440
my name is frank kalicek i'm a computer

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
scientist

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,840
german as you can hear open source

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
contributor for many many many years

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
over 20 years now

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,399
in founded lots of different projects

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,480
and initiatives but i'm

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,640
probably most well known to be the

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
founder of nexcloud and that's of course

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,800
also the topic

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,960
today um i will talk a little bit about

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,399
the current kobi 19 challenges that we

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,800
all have

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,559
how we work inside next cloud also with

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,079
next cloud obviously

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,080
then a little bit about our open source

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
community which is also distributed

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,320
obviously

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,400
some social aspects and then a summary

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,080
so the current challenges i mean we all

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,680
know the situation where we

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,479
are the last year was not easy

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,600
we had a global pandemic which brought a

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,119
lot of challenges

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,479
for all of us so first of all

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,920
most of us worked from home um so

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,479
um remote work was something that

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,520
was standard for some companies like

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,759
next cloud

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,960
or but for some others it was a huge

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,000
cultural shift

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,640
and this of course is a result of the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
social distancing that we all um had to

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,159
do there's a

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
big change for a lot of people another

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
thing is of course that schools were

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,520
closed

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,119
most of the time which brought

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,240
additional challenges

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,640
to us um we had our children at home we

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
had to

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,640
look take care of them this interacted

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,560
with our work environment so this were

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,040
all mixed together which brought a lot

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
of

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
churches to all of us then of course

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,560
also for an open source

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,239
uh community like nexcloud um this also

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,000
meant a lot of changes i mean our

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,040
community is obviously remote and

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
distributed

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,360
from all over the world but we had our

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,720
events so here for example you see a

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
photo of our

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,319
last next cloud conference that yes in

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,920
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,239
where we hundreds of people came

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,560
together in berlin here and we

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,239
celebrated and worked together and

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,440
brainstormed and shaped the future of

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,040
the project

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
obviously this can't happen anymore and

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,720
this is also a challenge

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,800
that comes with the current pandemic

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
and there's of course the there's of

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
course the

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
on the social side the influence all of

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,599
this has on

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,640
our ourselves um so there is a

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,040
lot of depression social isolation

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,200
going on and this is can be really

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,680
really hard for a lot of people

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
and that's another challenge that we all

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
have but

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,400
also for our companies in our

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,040
communities

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,080
so um what does this mean for the future

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,879
obviously

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
hopefully the pandemic will be over soon

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,599
but

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,000
some of those changes stay and there are

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,400
some interesting learnings that we all

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,760
can have from this situation and that's

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,120
of course the topic

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,599
of our of this talk here now

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,760
so the question is do we will will we go

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,640
back to offices like that

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,560
i mean some of you remember like super

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,640
crowded offices where we all work

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
together very loud obviously

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
if there's a virus here in the air right

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,000
that's another good idea

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,440
so will we go back to that that's an

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
interesting question

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,280
what about crowded meetings i mean there

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,720
are a lot of companies and organizations

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,640
that really really

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,480
need their meetings i mean if you don't

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
your meeting then you can't really work

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,319
together this is the company culture

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,879
of a lot of companies so will there be

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,879
meetings like that again

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,040
and this is of course the topic i want

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,280
to talk about because the next cloud

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,680
we always had a remote work culture

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,760
with next cloud of course we have this

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,439
very big international community of

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,199
contributors from all over the world i

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
mean they're not in the same office

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,280
right they're not in the same meeting

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,479
they always did remote work

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,120
and of course then there's also the

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,919
company i mean as a company the nexus gm

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
page

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,120
we have employees from over 13 countries

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,320
so again they're all not in the same

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,040
office and not in the same meeting

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,880
and how can we do that and that's

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,759
something i want to talk about

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
here today obviously we use next load as

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
a tool so we under

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
very lucky situation that our product

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,600
that we that we produce

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,800
next cloud is also software for exactly

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
that situation

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
the next stop can be used for remote

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
work and that's what we did

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,880
so what is important what are the

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,600
important principles what are the

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
things that we always follow the next

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,240
cloud

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
but of course we are not amplified the

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,440
last few months

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,160
in the in the pandemic so the first is

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,000
i think it's really important to give

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,160
everybody in the company

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,160
the flexibility in time place and speed

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,199
what do i mean with that first of all

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,240
flexibility

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,039
in time so um there's

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
a lot of companies where you do um nine

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,240
to five

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,720
work you like just like come in the

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
morning

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,639
every lunch break and then you leave and

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,080
that's it but of course in this

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
in the situation that we are at the

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
moment um

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
we have people working like in the

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,479
evening or in the early morning

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,720
because in the middle maybe they have to

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,840
take care of their kids or take care of

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
their relatives

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
so we really need a flexibility in time

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
it's no longer the case

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,720
that everybody who is working on a

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,319
project is basically online or basically

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,400
together at the same time

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
we have to have flexibility in time

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
second displays obviously so we have a

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,199
lot of people doing working from remote

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,080
so what does this mean means that we

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,080
can't have papers anymore or like

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,919
being doing brainstorming in the same

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,720
room um that's something

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,160
um that needs to change and then speed

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
right we have to be

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
respectful to our co-workers who have a

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,800
lot of challenges at the moment

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,479
maybe as i said that have to take care

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
of their kids because they can't go to

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,880
school

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
or you have a sick relatives or maybe

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,960
they're like sick themselves

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,160
so we can't expect the same performance

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
from everybody

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,919
as in a normal situation so we all have

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
to understand

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,479
that and be respectful to each other um

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,199
that is a special situation and we have

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,759
to yeah

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,520
respect different work speeds we have

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,080
here

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,599
the second is also very important not a

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
lot of people talk about it is

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,360
asynchronous communication

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
what do i mean with it so synchronous

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
communication is that if i really

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
directly talk with each other

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,199
in person or on the phone that's easy

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
but if you like have people

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,039
who are maybe not available at the

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,560
moment or maybe they're in a completely

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,520
different time so maybe they're sleeping

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,759
at the moment when

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,919
while you are working so what you really

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,560
need is asynchronous communication which

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,400
means

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
you have to be able to work together

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,120
with someone without

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
um we are being together at the same

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,919
moment

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,160
and and tools for that is chat for

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,360
example or other workflow tools that we

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,039
develop

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,720
at next cloud so this is better than

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,800
directly calling someone

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,880
and by the way this is also called an

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,599
important or a good thing without a

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,599
pandemic

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
um because if you just always call

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
someone you interrupt the people all the

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,240
time

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,599
while in other ways of communicating or

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,280
with chat for example

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
they can look after the messages when

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,319
they have time so it's also

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,960
better for productivity overall the

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,360
third is transparency being as open

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
as possible to everyone okay so if

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,960
you're not in the same

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,879
room and it's a building everybody's

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,199
sitting at home remote

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,960
it's so important that everybody has the

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
same information

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,479
you have to be communicated you have to

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,199
transparent you have to share

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,080
all the information you have otherwise

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,240
you lose this

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,639
team spirit you lose like the

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,479
productivity goes down because if the

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,560
company falls apart because not

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,599
everybody has the same information

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,759
then um this is not working at all so be

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,000
be transparent as transparent is

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,759
absolutely possible

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
then you have to trust people and it's

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,519
something a lot of people claim

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,039
that they trust their employees but

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,919
there are lots of them who actually

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,519
don't a lot of them they really need to

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,360
monitor the people that are in the

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,800
office in times they leave the office in

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,279
time that i don't

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,959
i don't know the breaks are not too long

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
and this is like this kind of micro

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,040
management that's not a good thing

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,720
and if everybody's at home you can't do

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,240
this in the first place right you can't

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
you don't know when they start to work

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,279
and

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
stop to work so you have to trust them

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,839
and that's so important you have to be

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,880
result oriented which means it should

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
not matter

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,920
when someone starts to work or stops to

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
work or

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
if they're sitting at in front of the

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
computer all the time or not

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,040
it's only important that the results are

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
good so that's something that's

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,519
absolutely

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
key then communication is so important

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,560
right

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,200
always over communicate may it's so much

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,080
better to

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,839
even repeat some things several times

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
instead of not communicating something

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,399
at all because then people feel

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
disconnected they don't have the

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,040
information

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,040
and that's not helpful okay

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
so these are the principles we came up

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,399
with like years ago

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,760
but they became so important now with

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,120
the current

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,440
pandemic so how does this really work in

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
in real life so how does this really

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,519
really work

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,040
um using next cloud so there are lots of

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,760
different aspects to that

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
let's first talk about access access the

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
right information

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,200
access to the right applications tools

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,080
to everything and this might sound

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,920
obvious

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,079
but believe me if you look inside a lot

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,079
of companies they're not prepared for

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,959
that ex you'd have access if you're in

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,240
the office

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,480
if you're outside the office you don't

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
have access of course that's something

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,240
that's the first step to being

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,839
productive from home

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,120
so i don't i'm not a big fan of vpns

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,839
or other like clunky corporate

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
tools where you enforce people to use

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,399
certain

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,240
applications or like monitor devices

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,440
from your system administration team or

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,040
something like that

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
we really believe in bringing your own

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,519
device people should be productive on

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,480
any device they have it doesn't matter

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,920
if it's like

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,839
it doesn't matter what device it is can

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
be a phone can be a template can be a

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,120
laptop doesn't matter people

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,440
should be able to work from everywhere i

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,600
want without the vpn

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
and that's something of course we can do

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,760
with next cloud

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,720
with next slot we have password policies

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
which means we can

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,320
enforce certain security standards even

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,040
if the

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,640
if the people use their own private

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,560
devices for something

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
maybe someone has like five minutes of

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,519
time to check an email while they're i

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,079
don't know

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,880
waiting at the supermarket or something

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,680
um

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,120
which is important in this unusual

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
stressful times

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,959
but then still have the highest level of

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,279
security and we can enforce that for

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,480
example here with password policies

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,720
another thing is two-factor

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,079
authentication right even if you bring

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
your own device

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,440
you can have really high security

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,040
standards

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
and we support all kinds of two-factor

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,279
authentication in xcloud and that's

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,120
absolutely

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,600
important then uh remote wipe

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
right that's something maybe a private

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
device

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,720
is like lost or i don't know it's no

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,480
longer trusted or i don't know

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,959
it's so important that you can go into

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,639
your settings and delete the device

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,000
and everybody can do that right the

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,079
sysadmin can do it too

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,079
of course but you yourself you can also

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,880
manage your devices maybe you realize

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
that oh

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,639
the tablet is now used by by the kit

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,880
it's cool and

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,839
they still have the company data in it

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,880
maybe i quickly

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
delete the company data and you can do

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,600
this

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,279
at any time we have some

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
artificial intelligence built in a

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,120
neural network that detects suspicious

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,560
logins

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,680
right so we can detect if a person

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
logs in from a untrusted ip space at an

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,639
unusual time

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,959
and give a warning to the sales admin

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,680
but also the user of themselves

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,480
again this is so important if you work

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,200
from home

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
outside your corporate network out not

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,959
using your

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,880
corporate desktop bring your own device

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
but still have the right security to be

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,760
sure

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,519
that the login is not compromised by

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,160
them

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
file access control can gives you the

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,480
possibility

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
to create like rules um where you can

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,000
say

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,000
look this data can only be accessed

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,920
from this kind of person if they're in

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
the vpn or if they're actually

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,959
in the office building because it's

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,040
super super

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,480
important but other documents can be

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
able to um

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,839
to be accessed from home so you can

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,120
actually have this different

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,399
document classification and have this

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,399
high security that

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,680
actually someone only working in your

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,800
local network has

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,320
but still endorse bring your own device

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
for most of the documents so you can

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,200
actually

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,440
combine those different things and

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,279
enforce it as net

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,920
and to end encryption also something

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:35,120
that's very important or if the devices

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,600
is compromised or if something happens

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
with the network or with the server

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,040
there's it's always good to be

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,680
um to be more safe than sorry later

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,399
so we support all kinds of encryption

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,399
and also

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,480
enter the encryption for super secure

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,480
documents

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,920
another thing that i have here in this

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,399
access

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,760
section is a new feature which is called

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,040
user status

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,040
which means a person can when they

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,600
start to work automatically check in

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,880
they can say hey i'm here i'm online now

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
or hey i'm offline i have to cook or i

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,920
have to

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
go somewhere now and come back later you

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,320
can communicate this with your

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,079
with your colleagues why i use a status

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,000
you also know if someone is like sick or

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,440
on vacation or what's going on

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,279
and this automatic shows up in the

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,560
shared dialogue in the chat in all kinds

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
of different places

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,639
so you know what's going on with the

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,800
with the person

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,560
okay so this was the first part i wanted

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,560
to talk about which is access

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,079
okay so it's so important that everybody

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,720
has access to the data

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,800
even if they work from home of course

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,639
access is only the first part because

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
then at the end if you have access

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,480
then you really need to do something

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,800
with your documents with your files

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,560
and for that it's so important that you

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,760
can access all your documents from

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,440
everywhere

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,600
and obviously there's something next can

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,760
do it's a file so you can share solution

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,639
so the idea is that you don't know no

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,440
longer need

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,519
applications like a sharepoint or some

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
windows network drive or something

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,440
everything is next cloud you can swing

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,680
and share it from everywhere

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
you have different views to access your

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
documents if you have something more

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,120
visual

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,240
pdf documents or movie files or pictures

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,639
something there's

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,480
elegant ways to access your data and

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,639
doesn't matter what they are

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,639
obviously sharing collaborating with

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,279
others is super important to have very

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,320
very powerful sharing features with

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,480
permissions

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
password protection expiration dates and

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,279
all kinds of things

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
um then if you're sitting at home and

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,240
you have access to all your company

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,440
documents and you have like

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,959
100 or thousands of folders with

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,880
documents and you really don't

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,399
really know what's going on it's so

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
important i have documentation so

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
introduce the feature

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
that can actually document on top of a

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,920
folder what kind of documents are in

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,959
this folder you can see here this is

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,560
from project you can see the milestones

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,720
and you actually know what's going on

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,240
and what this folder is so that's

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,240
super important you don't normally need

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,079
to go somewhere or call someone hey

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,880
where is this file you can actually see

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,639
it in the documentation

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,959
another thing that's very important if

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
you don't work in the same office but

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,560
disconnected is

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,720
that you're able to lock a file to have

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,839
exclusive access to it

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,680
right because some documents you can

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,000
work together collaboratively i'll come

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
back to this later but other documents

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,519
like if you have a photoshop file or

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
something movie file maybe you work on a

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
marketing video

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,800
and you edit the file and someone else

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,480
editing at the same time

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,079
then you have two versions and to

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,720
prevent it you can say no i'm working on

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,600
this now

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,720
i have access to it and it's only me of

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,639
course

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,959
then others if they see the document is

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,120
locked maybe they want to chat

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,880
and ask hey what's going on and also

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,120
wanted to work on that and have

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,480
our integrated integrated chat here

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,920
which is super helpful to

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,480
coordinate again outside office

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,320
of course we have mobile apps for ios

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,880
and android and tablet so you can

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,039
really access and do everything doesn't

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,280
matter what kind of device you have

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
push notifications are super important

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,240
right it's like

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,679
you get a message if something is

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,199
happening with a file that you're

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,199
working with if someone's to

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,799
talk with you chat with you if you're

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,679
running out of quota if something

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,760
happens

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,919
that's a really nice way to communicate

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,120
and again as i said earlier asynchronous

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
right you don't need to respond

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,360
immediately

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,200
but you see hey there's something

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,640
interesting once you have time you can

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,120
look into it

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,559
desktop client m is also there they can

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,960
synchronize your files off

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,559
offline to a desktop maybe you don't

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
have the best internet connection at

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,120
home

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
right or you work like not from remote

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,640
from a country

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,320
where internet is slow um that with the

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,000
syncing client you can actually sync all

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,720
the important documents offline work

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
with them

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,760
and then once they're changed you

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,720
synchronize it on

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,200
up to the to the cloud again um but this

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,559
happens

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,720
in the background it doesn't block you

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,280
from being productive

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
um data access engine is a cool feature

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
because a lot of organizations that

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,400
still have like

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,080
share points or other basically data

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
styles in the organization

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,919
but this can all be consulted in the

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,960
next cloud so nextup can be a tool for

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,280
remote work

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,320
for being productive from outside the

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,880
office by

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,960
mounting all the sources into into next

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,760
cloud

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,520
we support access control lists so as an

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,360
administrator you can really

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,520
find a brain control over who can access

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,720
what folder who can read and write

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,679
based on on groups for example another

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,360
other metrics or securities guaranteed

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,600
search is very powerful

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,480
so you can find all your files and

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
folders and

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,080
chat and calendar entries and contacts

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
and project management entries

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,360
everything and with the integrated

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,600
search

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,000
even like searching inside documents

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,280
obviously this is super super helpful

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,880
for remote work okay so this is working

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,559
with documents and files

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,240
again you should do this you should use

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,080
all these features don't use paper

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,960
right paper is in the office paper is

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,559
not at home please don't send papers by

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,880
mail around that's not good

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,240
please be a paperless organization and

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,559
the sub-document

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
workflows that we have here okay let's

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,000
talk about communication obviously

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,480
communication is super important

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,400
the next cloud we have next.talk it's a

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,400
very important tool we have

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
they can chat with your co-workers we

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
have a video

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,320
[Music]

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,559
chatting tool where you get video calls

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,559
one-on-one or group calls

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,400
everything works for mobile including

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,440
push notifications on your phone if

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,080
something happens

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,679
you have that screen sharing to really

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
work together on documents here for

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,039
example someone's

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,360
sharing a photoshop file others give

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,080
feedback you work together here

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,799
upload a file directly into a chat

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,600
channel

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,960
that's super handy you can organize

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,520
webinars or

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,200
basically moderated meetings where it

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
starts at a certain day

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,960
everybody is invited before that is a

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,679
lobby and then the

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,720
call starts useful for webinars but also

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,679
like for big

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,280
corporate company meetings we have

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,320
integrated into chatbots

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,799
so some some automation things are are

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,720
useful so chatbots can also interact

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,840
with other software you have in your

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,919
organization

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,440
by triggering actions directly from you

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,120
inside your chat

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,720
and of course the chat is integrated

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,480
into all kinds of other

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,400
tools here for example if you share a

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
pdf you can directly chat

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,559
with everybody else who is looking at

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,039
the same pdf

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,880
okay so communication correct but at the

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,000
end of the day you really want to edit

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,640
documents so how can you edit documents

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,320
um so for that we have several solutions

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,280
first of all we have our very nice

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,760
lightweight

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,280
markdown editor textbook editor built in

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,760
where you can just type in

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,600
notes and brainstorming ideas and this

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,799
is especially cool because it works

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,400
collaboratively

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,640
so if you share it with others then

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,679
several people can review it together

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,240
in the same document and work together

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,440
with everybody else and of course you

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,200
can have a chat

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,799
and a video call while working on the

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,840
same document so this is nicely

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,600
integrated

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,360
that's a very very cool tool it's really

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,679
like sitting in the same office and

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,480
brainstorming about something

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,159
of course you also have office documents

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,000
and for that we have different solutions

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
integrated this is for example on the

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,760
office with the solution

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,720
which is integrate next level you can

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,960
work

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,000
edit your obvious documents like word

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,120
excellent powerpoint

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,799
everything you need and again um this

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,440
also works collaboratively

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,039
together with other people um this is by

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,720
the way the second solution we have

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,720
which is collaborate online

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,000
which is also an option you have two

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,320
options you can choose

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,559
but those work this full nice office

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
integration to work together with others

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
and again you have the feature here to

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,919
do a video call and a chat

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
while collaboratively with several

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,320
different cursors work in the same

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
word file for example that's super super

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,360
useful

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,679
what i showed you so far was all in the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,679
in the browser but of course this also

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
works on mobile here is a template for

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,039
example

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,880
where you can edit your words document

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,600
collaboratively together with other

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
people

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,520
directly on your on your tablet and

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,200
you can protect your documents from like

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,000
leaking to the outside

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,520
by adding watermarking based on certain

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
tags or user groups

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,559
or other criterias that's very very

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,400
helpful to have this

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,720
watermarking for against data leakage

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
now quickly about groupware obviously

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,760
there is also

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,520
important that you have calendaring that

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,919
is like shared with everybody you can

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,600
coordinate who is doing what when where

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,400
nicely shared coloring with different

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,760
viewers um obviously you have a free pc

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
view where you can see

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,600
if someone else has time if you want to

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,760
open a meeting

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,520
if you send someone invite with one

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,679
click you can automatically

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,679
add a talk room um they are super useful

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,039
um you can read your mails inside next

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,240
cloud um

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,440
very powerful direct integration with um

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,280
with documents in next slot files

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,039
again it's very useful if you're sitting

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,640
at home in homework you have everything

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,840
together everything combined in one

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,200
application

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,039
it can automatically detect tickets

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,480
at the moment we don't do a lot of uh

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,640
traveling of course

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,640
but in the future if you have a train

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,600
ticket a plane triggered or hotel

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
reservation

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,600
it's all automatically detected in your

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,760
mails and can add it to your calendar

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,520
and project management next load deck is

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,760
a very very powerful

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,440
kanban style project management tool

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,600
which is really really helpful for a lot

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,480
of people

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,400
okay so these are basically the ways we

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,640
work together as next cloud

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,159
remotely even before the pandemic but

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,080
during the pandemic too

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,840
and for most of our people it really

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,279
didn't make a lot of difference because

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,919
we use these digital

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,279
communication tools anyways but of

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,080
course there's also the open source

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,080
community

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,200
so nexlot has this very big open source

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,679
community of over 2

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,400
000 volunteers that are testing feature

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
request

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
development packaging all kinds of

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,360
things um

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
and they're all also not in the same

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,840
office all the time obviously

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
right and for that we use github github

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,720
is very powerful popular tool

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,159
where we have all the code discussions

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,400
um feature requests

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,520
and pull requests and everything there

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
and everybody can

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
contribute you can also do this by

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,799
writing a bug report for example

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,960
everything is open

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,159
and again this is asynchronous right you

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,559
don't have to recall

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,159
someone say hey i found a bug you type

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,000
in the back report it's recorded and

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,799
once someone later looks at it they can

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
find it

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,520
it's very nicely of course time zones

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,880
across different

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,120
continents um very nice tool

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,200
translation the same it's translated by

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,720
a lot of to a lot of languages 96

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
languages at the moment

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
again this can be done asynchronously by

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
our community

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
super productive we didn't really notice

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,799
any difference

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,960
through the pandemic here and promotion

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
marketing material everything is there

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,360
and at the end of the day of course

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,320
contributing code

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,679
is also very easy with pull requests

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,679
with this open for everybody

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,520
okay so at the end of the call i want to

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,559
talk weekly also about some social

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
aspects

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,360
because so far i talked about the right

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,679
tools and the tools are

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,200
important for the company culture to

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,159
stay productive

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,120
but the social aspects are also very

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,240
important

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,720
so as we all know the current situation

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
can lead to depression and isolation and

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,360
other negative effects

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,559
and that's not really good and we came

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,200
up with several

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,919
ideas what we can do here to keep

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,240
everybody together to keep everybody

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,760
motivated to keep the social ties

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,679
between everyone

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,039
even if you're remote and not in the

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
same office

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,120
so the first thing we introduced where

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,640
virtual watercooler or little coffee

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,840
machine

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,720
basically is like a place it's like a

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,919
talk room here in the next talk which is

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,799
always open

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,080
and if you want to grab like a coffee i

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,000
want to chat with someone

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,600
quickly you can just quickly go into

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
this room and maybe there's someone else

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,120
and i can just do a little bit of small

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,600
okay how is your day how is it going

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,480
it's just like a coffee machine

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,400
like a little office kitchen where you

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,840
can quickly meet people

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,279
um so that's nice to talk with people

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,440
sometimes

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,960
another thing is co-working course

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,919
that's also something we

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,520
we introduced that this is something our

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,159
teams and project

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,240
teams do from time to time if you have a

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,520
few people working together on the same

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,320
topic

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,919
then sometimes they're just do a call

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,320
which goes on for three

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,440
four hours sometimes and you're just in

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
the call

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
you don't speak all the time you walk

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,919
but it's like sitting in the same room

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
you can

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,520
always talk hey what do you think about

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,880
this thing or hey

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,640
where do you know where this information

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,480
is on our problem just if you see

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,320
to get in the same office while you're

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
being productive but you connected with

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,440
other people

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,760
still connected and then of course

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,640
there's also the evening part

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,440
so you introduced regular beer o'clock

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,520
calls

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,279
which are just social calls in the in

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,960
the evening where we don't

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,440
have this rule that we don't talk about

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,440
work related things we just get together

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,960
talk a little bit maybe have a beer or

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,520
not actually

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,039
and just being social and like yeah stay

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,399
connected

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,919
okay which leads me to the summary um

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,600
i think remote work can be more than a

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,720
compromise if you have the right

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,159
tools if you write company culture that

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,440
you trust people

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,399
that you stay together and you have all

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,799
the

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,840
all the trust all the tools all the

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,120
processes

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,919
built up in a way then remote work can

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,679
really be nice so we are doing this

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
before the pandemic and will we do this

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,320
after the pandemic too

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,960
um which because it has lots of benefits

00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,919
so

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,080
our people that save the commute time

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,080
and which at the end is money of course

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
they can work from everywhere it's

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,279
family friendly

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,039
and from a company's perspective it also

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,919
means that we can work with the best

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,000
people

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,200
because if you only want to hire people

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,159
that in that

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,559
that are in the same city where you are

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,159
then

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,919
you don't find the best people because

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,960
the best people might work from

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,399
somewhere else

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,720
and if you have a company culture where
