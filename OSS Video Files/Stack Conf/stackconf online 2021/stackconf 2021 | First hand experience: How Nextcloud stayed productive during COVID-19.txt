We are all now experiencing that remote working and virtual conferencing are important tools to stay connected. Not just in current circumstances but also in the wider future. That is why it is important to offer an easy-to-use, efficient, and quick replacement. Nextcloud is a platform for complete online collaboration and communication and can help to quickly adept and stay connected. Nextcloud is built by Nextcloud GmbH that has employees in home-offices in 11 countries and the Nextcloud Community which is spread all over the world. This talk gives an inside look at how Nextcloud GmbH works together with the Nextcloud community-building Nextcloud. It covers different communication channels that work for synchronous and asynchronous communication, how coordination in distributed teams works, and how good and efficient collaboration around documents is possible. Additionally, but also very important to share, this talk covers some of the challenges and solutions on how to successfully work across different countries, time zones, languages, and cultures.
