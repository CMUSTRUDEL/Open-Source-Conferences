We hear a lot about using service mesh with Kubernetes and public clouds, but what about outside the clouds? In this talk, you’ll learn creative ways to apply a service mesh across different platforms and environments to automate canary deployments, facilitate cloud migrations, and more. By combining HashiCorp Consul’s service mesh and Terraform’s infrastructure as code, you can build a more seamless operational experience across multiple environments.
