Title: stackconf 2021 | Monitoring Microservices The Right Way
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: stackconf online 2021
Description: 
	by Dotan Horovits

Modern systems today are far more complex to monitor. Microservices combined with containerized deployment results in highly dynamic systems with many moving parts across multiple layers. These systems emit massive amounts of highly dimensional telemetry data from hardware and the operating system, through Docker and Kubernetes, all the way to application and its databases, web proxies and other frameworks. Many have come to realize that the commonly prescribed Graphite+StatsD monitoring stack is no longer sufficient to cover their backs. New requirements need to be considered when choosing a monitoring solution for the job, including scalability, query flexibility and metrics collection. In this talk Horovits will look at the characteristics of modern systems and what to look for in a good monitoring system. He will also discuss the common open source tools, from the days of Graphite and StatsD to the currently dominant Prometheus. This talk will put you on the right track for choosing the right monitoring solution for your needs.
