Most people will claim that this never happens, others hope it never happens, but it happened on March 10, 2021, and it was not just the 1 datacenter that got impacted, but the whole campus of the provider that got powered down. This talk will explain how our customers survived this outage, how our culture, opensource tooling and automation saved the da(y,ta). A talk about disaster recovery, business continuity plans and building cloud agnostic stacks that survive disasters.
