Title: stackconf 2021 | How DevOps changed the way we operate software
Publication date: 2021-06-24

Description: 
	by Serhat Can

It’s been more than a decade since the inception of devops. A lot has changed since then. We now live in a world where many traditional ops responsibilities distributed among teams. We are also seeing a dramatic change in how we do ops. Ops people are now writing code and testing them the way developers write business logic. But does this give enough context? Of course not. In this talk, we are going to cover how devops change the way we create and run software – and talk about what is next!

[Applause]

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,119
[Music]

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,439
hello everyone

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,240
so my name is sarhat jan and uh today we

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,880
are going to be talking about devops

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
and i'm pretty sure you have heard about

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,359
devops before

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
but uh not everyone knows how it relates

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,920
to formula one

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
or ants so in this talk we are going to

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,640
learn

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,520
how devops changed the way we operate

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
software

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,320
and uh it's gonna be hopefully it's

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,320
gonna be fun

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,399
so first of all

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,520
there is no right or wrong uh

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
in this talk i mean as you know software

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,879
is

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,079
complex but when we are talking about

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,359
humans

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,239
things get a lot more chaotic and that's

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,439
fine

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,520
after all we cannot agree uh

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,200
we cannot even agree on how to spell

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,799
devops right

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,000
there are different variations and

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,560
there is no right or wrong way

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,439
and it's on purpose so before we start

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,720
i'd like to

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,240
uh talk a little bit about myself

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,880
my name is again sarhat jan and i'm an

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,439
technical evangelist at atlassian i've

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,280
been working with the obscenity team

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,439
for five years before that

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
before the evangelism role i was an

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
engineer

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
and now uh i'm also an aws community

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,520
hero so i do a lot of speaking

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,479
and a lot of uh content for awsa custom

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
as well

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,240
i'm also a conference organizer at

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,479
devops state's global team

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,880
devops says istanbul aws community

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,439
turkey and server stay stumbled

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
i'm also helping i'm also helping run

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,119
communities in turkey collat and service

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,759
turkey and devops turkey

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,200
so if you happen to come to turkey after

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,080
the pandemic

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,080
i'll be happy to

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,200
arrange you a talk and hang out

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,800
so just please reach out to me and i'm

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
able to chat

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
so uh as always let's talk a little bit

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,800
about why because it's

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,519
it's uh i mean before we go

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,640
going to the how part because we need to

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
understand

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,720
why we needed devops to be able to

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,160
appreciate how it changed

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,480
the software industry so traditionally

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,239
developers were writing code and ops

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
people were responsible for running it

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,400
on production

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,959
but when this happens there is a lot of

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
friction

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,519
slowness and this conflict so when

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
developers don't have responsibilities

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
on software delivery of

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,440
production they don't get feedback on

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,239
their code and they don't have

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,239
empathy for the ops team so but but if

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,280
they get feedback usually

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,599
uh before devops is it was usually

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
too late or not considered as their

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
responsibility

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,159
so they didn't really need uh

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
feel the need to act on that feedback so

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,720
when problems occur

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,040
it was easy to blame the other team like

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
who is already responsible for running

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
the code on production you know that

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,799
team obstine right

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,840
and when look at the ops team is a

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
similar story

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
so they blame developers to write shitty

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,879
code

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,400
right and deal with alerts they deal

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,360
with dollars all day long

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,159
so there is no time for automation and

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,159
all that cool stuff

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
so the main problem in the story is

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,120
wrong incentives

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,879
and missing communication so devops aims

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
to solve this problem by breaking the

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,560
barriers between these teams and

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,120
allowing them to learn from each other

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
so there are different definitions of

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
devops

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,959
but the founders didn't make an official

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
definition statement because every

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,360
company and person

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,840
is different but they talk a lot about

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
some common features so let's take a

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,080
look at

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
two of my favorite devops definitions so

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
first

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,639
is from ken mcrage so he says devops is

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,799
a culture

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,840
where people regardless of title or

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,400
background

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,400
work together to imagine deploy develop

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
deploy and operate a system

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
so this definition focuses on

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,600
collaboration between teams

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,680
throughout the software development

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
cycle and so i i really like it

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
uh and the other one is a bit more

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,520
detailed it's from aws

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,320
official page on devops they describe

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,560
devops as the combination

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
of cultural philosophies practices and

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,479
tools it's important because

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
you might have heard some talks

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,320
mentioned all about is

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
devops is all about cultural or all

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,680
about tools

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,560
it's a combination of these and it

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
and the definition also focuses on the

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,199
importance of

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,440
pace and uh software is

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,440
obviously is expensive to run an update

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
so devops makes it cheaper

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,520
and it's important for organizations to

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,320
be fast

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,039
uh to stay relevant so it's a matter of

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,759
uh

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,280
life and that for many organizations so

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
they need to

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,880
be fast and

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,800
so i will not make my own definition but

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
in this talk instead i want to move on

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,440
to the hub part and explain my points on

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
how devops changed the way we operate

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
software

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
so regardless of the definition or

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
realities of the companies devops

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
changed

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
certain aspects of software development

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,800
and operations

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
in the last decade

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,600
so now after some boring definitions

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,919
let's talk a little bit about ants so

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,120
i'm not sure how many of you watched

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,199
black wars but i watched a lot of them

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,000
i really like them but you know ants

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,440
usually wins

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,520
their strength lies in numbers but

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,360
only if they work together so

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
individually they're not particularly

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,120
the strongest but

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
they are great at working together and

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,400
coordinating their activities so

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
software teams are not that different

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
software teams are also strong when they

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,560
work together

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,479
and individual efforts matters

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
but up to some point so it doesn't

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
matter a lot in the wrong

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,520
long run for big and complex software

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
projects

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,680
so that is why it's crucial to create a

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
shared responsibility

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
and the right incentives for devs and

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,360
ops to work together

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,960
so we need to create a culture of shared

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
responsibility among dev

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,400
and ops teams and there are ways to

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
create this

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,000
culture of shared responsibility so

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,120
first

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,440
teams should uh

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,440
should you need around uh one

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,199
customer-oriented goal their customers

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
come first it doesn't matter if it's an

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
external or external

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,199
internal or external customer but the

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
main goal is that you have a customer

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,319
and your goal is to

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,440
uh satisfy this that customers needs and

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,199
uh that's i mean at the end

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,440
the code writing the code is not the

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,240
point the point is someone

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,759
is getting the benefits of using that

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
code that service

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,120
so the second is the leadership support

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
it's important

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
for to create a cultural culture of

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,880
shared responsibility because without

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
leaders empowering teams

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,599
their impact their the teams or

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
individuals impact stays limited

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,840
to be able to achieve collaboration

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,919
between teams leaders must

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,759
repeat the same principles and commit

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,560
the necessary investment in tools and

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,440
practices

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,720
so the it's really important because at

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
the end of the day it's

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
devops requires a lot of investment in

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,840
time and money

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,599
and without the leadership support you

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
cannot create that culture of shared

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,280
responsibility

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,039
so and the third one is transparency for

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
a clear and effective communication

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,319
teams

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,759
should know their goals roadmap and

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,039
learn about updates

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,919
like i mean even if they're high level

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,960
they're useful for teams to unite

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,759
because

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,120
if you don't know uh what another team

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,199
is doing

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,160
you is really easy to blame um

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,039
easy to say that they are not working

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,120
effectively

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,039
or they are not collaborating well but

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
if you know their struggles

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,519
what they are working on uh it's easier

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
to empathize

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,919
and the the last button not the least

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,360
important of course

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,200
is uh the ownership part and our goal

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,480
at the end of the day is to increase

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,399
people's ownership

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,839
teams ownership so they make the best

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,839
decisions over the long run and take

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
responsibility

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,279
and i cannot go on to the next part

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,399
before i mention how effective delivery

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,000
pipelines are

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,399
to achieve this culture of shared

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,080
responsibility when software testing and

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,920
shipping cycle is automated

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,760
when the responsibility in shipping code

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,720
to testing environments or production is

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
automated

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,959
you start seeing people complain a lot

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,320
less teams start operating with less

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,680
dependencies

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,720
and more visibility so um

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,200
do you remember we mentioned the speed

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
of

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,399
uh software delivery so let's talk a

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,000
little bit about formula one

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,440
and you know the masters of speed

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,240
so uh the second part your team

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,680
that builds race cars and mechanics

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
build race cars

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,120
and drivers operate them right

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
but consider this what happens when

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
mechanics

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,519
don't drive and just build and drivers

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,160
don't understand about the mechanics and

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,000
just

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,080
they're responsible for driving i mean

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
if you try that let me assure you things

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,240
won't go well and

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,320
this responsibility has to be shared has

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
to go both ways mechanics should be able

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,160
to drive

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,480
the cars to be able to test them well

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,480
but

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,839
even more importantly drivers should be

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,279
able to

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,640
understand about cars and spark

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,399
parts so f1 actually fun drivers know

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,240
their engines so intimately

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,760
that they can usually report issues

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
before the engineers

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,040
sees them on their telemetries and so

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
one famous example is

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
michael schumacher could tell his

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
engineers

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,720
um when one of the walls was not sealing

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,399
properly

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,000
and that happens when driving it over

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,800
like uh

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
300 kilometer more than 330 kilometers

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,079
per hour

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,000
and for racing for position and on

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,640
multiple occasions have drivers

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,640
drivers communicated to the pit on an

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,480
impending engine blow up before even

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,519
before the engineers could confirm it

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,440
so they really feel

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,519
they are really masters of their

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
mechanics and racing for

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,839
for professional outfit requires

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,800
intimate understanding of each component

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
of the car not just

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,240
engines drivers usually provide feedback

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,079
on the ira changes that they want

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,360
for example they could say like uh

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,920
before the pitstop they

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,880
change the angle of the nose wing by

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
let's say three

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,120
uh plus rotations and what the wheels

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,720
are doing they they are masters of

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,880
whatever years are doing great

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,720
tires brake brake bytes and so much more

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
so giving the right feedback after

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,279
sessions is important

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
then going out and doing all-out racing

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,480
so

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,000
how is this related to devops actually

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
it's very much related

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,480
so just as we cannot expect

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,399
sorry just as we cannot expect fun

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,519
drivers from low end drivers to just

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,040
drive we cannot expect developers to

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
just write code anymore

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,639
that we be a proven that that doesn't

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,959
work

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,800
so developers should take part in

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,200
software delivery and operations

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,959
they need to get alerts and when things

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,639
when things go sideways they need to

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,000
take responsibility

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,720
there are three major benefits for

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,279
developers taking ownership and

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,160
responsibilities on production issues

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,560
first there are ever increasing demands

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,880
around

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,480
availability reliability and security of

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,480
our applications nowadays

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,519
and without developers we cannot achieve

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,160
that

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
and the second one is and this is the

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,200
major benefit for our case

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,079
how devops how park it helps

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,680
dev teams and ops that it helps

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
developers teams the

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
developers to gain empathy for the

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,000
operations teams because now

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,680
they expect they they see the problems

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,720
from the first hand

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:52,399
they receive alerts they uh

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,920
they see compromises they made on the

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,920
development

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,240
the effect of those compromises on the

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,800
production so now they can

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,880
empathize and the other one is

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,720
developers and management

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,519
uh collaboration empathy because when

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,760
when if operations engineers are

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,399
responsible for production

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
uh the the management would just ask

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,120
developers

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,000
to just create features when they want

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,279
to prioritize

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,720
operational issues they will be hesitant

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
because they don't really see like i

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,519
mean i mean all they see is developers

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,800
performing

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,440
really at high pace uh when things are

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,519
really going

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,959
worse in the operation side but then

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
developers spend their time on

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,120
operations

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,760
and and then uh if they prior

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
they did this their daily in daily daily

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,040
routine

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,800
now management can also see uh the

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,079
operations

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
bet decisions they made

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,480
the effect of bet decisions they made on

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,279
developers so now

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,639
it's easier to prioritize uh the

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,160
operational issues

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,480
when devs are also in charge

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,680
so uh referring back to formula one we

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
don't have to build

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,440
many things ourselves anymore so many

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,279
formula advanced teams also don't build

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
their own engines they use it from other

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,839
companies

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
and they are pretty successful in the

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,079
composition too so clouds

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
uh and devops you know enabled companies

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,040
to achieve the same thing

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,800
develops change the way we approach

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,760
software ownership and

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,600
operations is a obviously long game and

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,720
it's expensive

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:36,079
so the change that devops brings usually

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,680
using sorry using actual code and apis

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,920
to manage infrastructure

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,360
changed how we approach traditional

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,880
operations

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,800
so we now don't have to build many

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,560
things from scratch

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,320
and that's really powerful because of

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,480
course it doesn't mean

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
using uh just docker kubernetes or

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
jenkins

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,959
uh that doesn't turn offs into an

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
engineering role but

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,600
this means following best practices like

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,240
infrastructure as code in operations

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,279
and we should be codifying our

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,480
infrastructure

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,560
and tools to provision process and

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
turn traditional operations into an

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,160
engineering role

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,360
and you know they will start codifying

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,360
things automating things

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,040
and the fun part being is when

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,440
automation becomes uh

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,399
our our actual job though so that's why

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,839
it's important

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,800
to avoid automate everything mantra

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,320
because that doesn't work but it is

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,279
important to

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,680
automate what matters for the for the

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,680
business

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:44,959
so uh one example

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,279
here is pets and cuddles kettles uh

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,079
there's an analogy uh i wanted to talk a

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,959
little bit about

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,800
like it's mostly used for cloud but it's

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,720
applicable for devops too so when we

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,680
create reusable infrastructure instead

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,399
of

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,920
naming our service to superhero names or

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,800
something else probably

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,560
you have seen that before we we start

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
using automation practices like

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
infrastructures code

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,720
so with modern practices to automation

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,600
develops

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,399
reduce complexity and apply learning

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
from

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,079
we can apply these you know codifying

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,839
things learnings

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,839
from development operations now

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,600
so another major way devops changed our

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,360
approach

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
to software is how we design an

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,959
architect software

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,480
to foster collaboration on ownership and

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,160
i really like this code

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
a good intention with a better approach

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,399
often leads to a poor result

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,160
so even though our intention is good if

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,920
we are not designing and architecting

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,040
well uh that will reduce our ability

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,480
uh to innovate and you know our success

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,759
in devops let's say

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,639
so uh at the end of the day we hear

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,560
devops along with microservices a lot so

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,399
microservices became popular in the last

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
decade

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,040
mostly because of the scale that these

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,279
you know it giants

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,799
became without devops practices

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
microservices

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
we just create chaos so lots of

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,880
investments into ops and automation is

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
required for a healthy microservices

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
environment

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,160
and microservices is needed not because

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,240
we need to scale our apps but because we

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,280
need to scale our organizations

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,919
and you know remember devops is the same

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,679
we have a lot of people and teams and we

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,520
need to reduce their dependencies

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,679
use you know automation practices and

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,200
foster the collaboration between team

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,880
with shared responsibilities

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,559
so when teams design an architect to

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
foster collaboration and ownership

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,240
they apply devops practices like

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,960
continuous integration and delivery

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,520
in their pipelines they start treating

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,520
infrastructure as code that helps them

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,600
they they start treating infrastructure

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,840
as code and that helps them

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:56,320
uh have fever bugs and outages

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,240
and essentially this makes companies

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,799
lose less money and move faster with

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,840
changes

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,960
and you know the uh number from uh

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,640
atlassian research uh 57 percent of

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
teams report fever bugs on how to just

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,000
by adopting after they adopt the icd

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,799
solutions and this

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,679
sends a powerful uh number powerful

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,720
message

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,880
and and the last item in my list is uh

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,919
and how devops changed our industry is

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,240
measurement for key success metrics

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,840
and we know that it's important to

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
measure but it's been hard without much

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,240
visibility

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,039
so this there is a fast

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,480
emerging concept a popular concept

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,600
called

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,080
service level objectives

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,799
that's from site reliability engineering

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,320
probably

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
if you heard about devops you heard

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,520
about sre uh from

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,600
the google originated let's say devops

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
implementation

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
they are detailed they are covered in

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,480
detail

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,400
in google's sre books so you can read

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,880
them i'm just going to mention what they

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
are

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,520
here just to give an idea on how devops

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,799
teams develops

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,120
teams may be a wrong word but nowadays a

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,720
lot of people use them so

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,000
how devops let's say uses service level

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,120
objectives

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,760
to measure uh the right things you can

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,039
call

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,720
them whatever you want you don't have to

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,640
call them serviceable objectives make

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,039
them work for your team that's important

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,600
but

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,120
fundamentally the goal is to use is to

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,679
tie business calls

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,440
to operational goals for example service

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:37,280
x let's say should return 99.9

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:40,960
of http requests under 10 milliseconds

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,520
that's a success

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,400
goal let's say that's a goal objective

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,720
for

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,039
a for service and that has an

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,080
impact on customers happiness and that's

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,960
an important

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,640
criteria for customers but obviously you

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,120
have to talk with the customer

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,799
and go over the objectives because you

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,080
don't want to just you know

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,080
make up some

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,159
some unimportant let's say uh

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,280
unimportant

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:16,320
objectives uh for example

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,600
let's say uh 90 percent test coverage

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,120
that doesn't mean anything for the

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,880
customers because that's an internal

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,799
thing right so remember the

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
the important part is customers come

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
first not the software itself so we need

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,640
to

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,520
talk with customers needs and

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,120
define service level objectives and

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,960
measure them

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,039
to to see however we are doing

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,640
and the another approach to devops

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,240
measurement is to keep track of some

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,520
important metrics

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,679
like uh lead time for changes deployment

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,000
frequency time to restore service or

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,120
change

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,720
failure rate we see these four metrics

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,440
in many uh places nowadays these metrics

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,760
are

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
good indicators of how well teams are

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,600
empowered to

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,760
operate on their own how stable these

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,240
automated pipelines are how prepared

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,480
teams

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
are to solve incidents as they happen

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,400
and you know

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,360
obviously you know no matter what you

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,280
will have

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,200
incidents um

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:21,600
so we talked about a lot of things we

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,799
talked about ants formula one examples

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,080
uh some different uh ways to empower

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,280
them ops teams

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,200
so just to wrap up um devops change the

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,360
way we operate software

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,320
um with devops we need to create a

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,280
culture

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,400
a shared responsibility culture among

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,360
developed

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,000
teams that's that's uh how devops the

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,720
biggest way that the the most important

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
uh way that devops changed our approach

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,840
we need to create a shared

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,280
responsibility is right incentives

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,360
and one of the important ways is to

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,799
give developers some responsibilities on

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
production on the way to production and

00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,919
production so they need to start taking

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,440
ownership

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,200
they need to be on call they need to get

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,679
alerts and then

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
ops people also have responsibilities

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,520
and nowadays we see obstacle renamed as

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,320
devops or sre

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
but we need to uh what we need to do it

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,440
doesn't matter what they are called

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,120
usually if the engineers are aware of

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,760
their responsibilities it doesn't matter

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,679
much but

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,039
at the end of the day with devops the

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,960
goal is to make turn

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,640
you want them to automate things and

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,600
approach problems

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
as an engineering

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,320
challenges and solve those problems so

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
and and even if we talk about giving

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
more

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,240
uh ownership more responsibilities to

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,600
developers

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,240
and expect us to opt to approach

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,960
operations as an engineering role we

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,960
need to build

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,400
the right architecture to foster

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,679
collaboration and ownership

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,600
because if we don't empower individual

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,840
teams

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,679
at the end of the day it's chaos so

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
without writer architecture it's really

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,360
hard to do

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,320
other things so it's an enabler and and

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,400
of course that's a well-known fact if we

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,559
don't measure we cannot improve so

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,880
we need to start measuring what matters

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:18,000
for the business for the customers

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:21,520
and um and uh take actions based on

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,840
what our customers actual

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,840
needs

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,799
so thank you very much for joining my

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,679
talk

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,679
uh you can reach out to me at srhdcn

00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,760
sarhatjamu.wafals on twitter or you can

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
add me on linkedin

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:51,730
i'll be happy to connect thank you very
