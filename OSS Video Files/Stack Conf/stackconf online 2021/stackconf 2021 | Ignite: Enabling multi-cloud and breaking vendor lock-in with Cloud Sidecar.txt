Cloud providers offer numerous services that abstract away common problems from software developers. No longer do companies need to manage their own file storage solutions, message queues, key-value stores, etc… The problem is, once you start building software on top of these services you get locked into that specific cloud provider. This is better known as vendor lock-in. Of course, the more services you use the harder it is to go multi-cloud or switch clouds. Cloud Sidecar solves the problem of vendor lock-in by converting requests from one cloud’s API to another cloud’s API. So, if your applications use Amazon Web Services’ S3 and SQS, you can easily deploy Cloud Sidecar next to your application and now it automatically uses Google Cloud’s GCS and Pubsub. Learn about Cloud Sidecar, how it works, how easy it is to modify your software to use it, and how you can deploy it.
