Coding can be taught line by line but not everyone is comfortable with purely text and logic based explanations of coding. The current status quo is to teach showing lines of code with inputs and outputs however a lot of visual learners are not going to easily grasp that. What if there was a way to communicate the code concepts with images? This talk will show how using geometry and modeling can acclimate novices to coding concepts using visual-spatial examples reinforced by coding concepts applicable anywhere.
