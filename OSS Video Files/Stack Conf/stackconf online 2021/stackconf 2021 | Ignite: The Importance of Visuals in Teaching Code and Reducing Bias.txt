Title: stackconf 2021 | Ignite: The Importance of Visuals in Teaching Code and Reducing Bias
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: stackconf online 2021
Description: 
	by Tadeh Hakopian

Coding can be taught line by line but not everyone is comfortable with purely text and logic based explanations of coding. The current status quo is to teach showing lines of code with inputs and outputs however a lot of visual learners are not going to easily grasp that. What if there was a way to communicate the code concepts with images? This talk will show how using geometry and modeling can acclimate novices to coding concepts using visual-spatial examples reinforced by coding concepts applicable anywhere.

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,119
[Music]

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,840
hi everyone thanks for joining me i'm

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,119
todd yacopian and this is the importance

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,720
of visuals and teaching code and

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,800
reducing bias

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,720
get going the preamble here is that

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,720
coding is permeating every kind of

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,119
professional field you can imagine

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,880
and that includes people who are in

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,559
creative fields designers people who may

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,399
not necessarily touch code because

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,920
it's becoming more useful in the kind of

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,600
workflows they adopt

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
and so you want to make people learning

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
something new that they have may have no

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,320
background in to feel more comfortable

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
learning new things

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
this is the story of how i did it for my

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,399
company uh in my

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239
experience my profession i teach people

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,760
how to use coding data and what

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,360
what have you for building design and

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,280
construction and

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,120
that includes architects with capital a

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,960
who draw

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,640
pictures of buildings they do everything

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,320
these days in 3d

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,040
and these really sophisticated models

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,439
that have lots of data and lots of uh

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
graphical information in it and they

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
want to do more they want to use

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,000
better tools for energy modeling so we

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,360
have a more efficient building they want

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
to use better tools for

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,880
occupancy planning so the layout of the

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,439
floor plans really

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
efficient but to get the most out of it

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,080
they need to learn a little bit about

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,080
coding so they can interface with the

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,600
apis of these softwares

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
and that's our goal is to teach them a

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,320
little about coding um

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,240
basic level just scripting nothing

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,720
production just know enough to get going

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,560
basic tooling very very straightforward

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,799
to make the most of the existing

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,159
software stack they have problem is we

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,520
don't have a devops team we don't have a

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
big programming team

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,840
so in order to you know future proof our

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
operations and get the best results

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
from our team make sure they can do the

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,840
best project they can uh

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
they are capable of we do teach them how

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,159
to code but not like traditional coders

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,680
that's why avoiding the bias of teaching

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,960
people a certain way

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,320
as though they have a cs degree is

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,439
critical because you might lose them

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,119
real quick

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,640
uh people even if they are technically

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,360
savvy if they are pretty comfortable

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,879
with

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,640
sophisticated project workflows

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,080
may be intimidated by something new like

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,680
coding that they don't have any real

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
first-hand experience of

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,599
and even with the best training system

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,120
in mind you might lose them because

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,120
sometimes they feel like they

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
they're off to a decent start there's a

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,680
big gap and before you know they feel

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,040
like they're lost

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,760
they feel like there's not enough

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,040
guidance there for how to work

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,879
so you want to remove these barriers and

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
make them feel comfortable so

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
here's a couple of steps you can take

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,000
make the first step not intimidating

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,040
make it so it's easy to get into

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,599
uh and then another barrier to remove is

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
uh

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
avoid too much text use visuals and

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
graphics for people who

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,519
like creatives designers what have you

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
we're comfortable in seeing things they

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
don't have to extract things of the text

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,080
and

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,440
you know uh problem solving uh patterns

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
yet they might get there eventually but

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
not yet

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
and the more methods of training people

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
the better you have to find your fit

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
make sure you the right approach

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
sometimes videos work sometimes in

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,680
person works sometimes

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,760
other methods work you have to find your

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
fit and we realized that

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,599
we had to get our the way of not using

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
text editors that's not a good

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,560
first step it's going to freak everybody

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
out to use a text editor they're not

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,319
going to understand this it looks like

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,480
the matrix

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,360
loading screen so we had to find a

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
better way

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,480
and visuals are a great way visuals can

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,120
represent something like a pythagorean

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,040
theorem

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,360
very efficiently in geometric algebraic

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,799
or coding formats so visuals can

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
actually be a great way to

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,159
get started in this case for example

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
this is python

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,440
uh making a loop with an integer with a

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
visual scripting medium and that was our

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,959
breakthrough it's like yes

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
visual scripting can be the key here and

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
where you can use digital scripting with

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
3d software we have in this case an open

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,920
source platform cloud dynamo that could

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,799
put both data and geometry into the

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,959
common uh

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
models we work with all time in this

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
case we can create

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,280
something with visual scripting and

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
dynamo of just connecting the points

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,480
in a rectangle processing them and

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
extruding them to create

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,080
floors and walls and before you know

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,319
your wireframe becomes a building

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
100 stories uh skyscraper you're ready

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,000
to go production level

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
and from these little examples in dynamo

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
we can start teaching people how to use

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
python script to get more sophisticated

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,959
results

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
like looping which is not easy to do

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,120
with visual scripts easy to do in a

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
coding

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
language and once we teach them that

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,280
they'll feel comfortable to take it from

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,519
there and

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,799
do more sophisticated workflows as they

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,079
get the hang of things

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,520
and then they can really get into the

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,000
game of it which is things like general

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
design

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
helping people create a better building

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
helping people create a better design

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
without having to do it so much manually

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,720
getting better room adjacencies

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,120
and this is all starts with some very

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
straightforward visual coding

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,800
studies and we even have our own good

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,880
example here of using

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,800
a energy based study of the building to

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,960
create lubers all we do is we study the

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,320
sun path

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,759
and energy gain of the building and

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,560
create a system using a visual

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
script

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
very excellent result and again remove

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,199
the barriers

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,120
make the first step not intimidating use

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,320
visual something easy to start with

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,039
emphasize visuals find different ways to

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,400
train people find your fit fill in the

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,000
gaps give a hoot

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,919
and here's some resources that you can

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280
use to get going on this

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,720
and thanks everyone this is a great

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,039
conference i appreciate your time here
