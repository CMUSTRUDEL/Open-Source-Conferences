Title: stackconf 2021 | Platform as a Product
Publication date: 2021-06-24

Description: 
	by Michael Cote

Most ops groups canâ€™t give developers what they need. Ops is limited by traditional service delivery mindset and tools. Stability & reliability are now table-stakes when you are releasing software daily. What developers need now from ops is innovation. Operations has rarely taken this innovation-driven, product approach to providing services, & instead focuses on delivering to specification & limiting SLAs. As with development, ops creates value with continuous operations, product managing their platforms and releasing frequently. This talk covers how ops groups are transforming from a service delivery mindset a platform-as-a-product approach. With examples from Discover Financial Services, Rabobank, the US Air Force, & others the talk covers the concept, technologies & tools commonly used, & ops tactics needed to kick-off a platform-as-a-product strategy.

[Applause]

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,440
[Music]

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
well hey

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
thanks for having me here to talk today

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,560
i want to go over uh

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,199
what over the years i've tried to reduce

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,720
down to a very simple concept

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,560
that i think is very powerful for the

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
way that people should be doing

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,400
infrastructure management operations

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
management whatever you call it in

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,160
in your organization oftentimes when it

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,719
comes to people who are in charge of

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,960
your uh

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,880
your vmware vsphere your virtualization

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
estate your vi admin

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,200
but as things have been changing you

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,480
know your uh your headwinds your digital

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
transformation

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,399
the need to do software better all of

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,879
that stuff the role

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,800
uh that custom written in-house software

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
plays changes dramatically the software

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
used to order groceries the software you

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,879
use

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,039
that you write on your own to manage

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,440
your supply chain the software you might

00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,920
use

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,440
for your uh your online banking the

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,199
software you might use to give out

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
emergency loans that people have needed

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,840
over the past year

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,600
all sorts of things like that there's

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
also interesting examples of there's a

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
car manufacturer

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
i've heard of who has an app that

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,320
collects together

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
the uh they call it a cv but it collects

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,799
together the history of a vehicle that

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
you've owned

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
and i just want to go over this one

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
because it's a fascinating example of

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,360
why we care about all this digital

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,119
transformation stuff in the sense that

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,439
what's interesting about that is it you

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,079
know uses all the the trillions of data

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,280
bytes of data bytes of of data that we

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,759
always hear about

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
and then also the idea of uh computers

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
you know cars being rolling computers

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,759
but you have this very simple kind of

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,000
almost quotidian thing of here is the

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,600
dossier of this car's history

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,439
and what you can use it for when you're

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,439
selling that car is to prove the

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,040
truthfulness of the good shape of that

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,960
car right like you think about

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,079
selling cars between uh you know used

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,880
cars to people and it's

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,880
largely based on distrust right that am

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
i getting a lemon a bad car and how

00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
would i even know if this is a good car

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
if it's been in a wreck

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,360
that they've taken care of it but if you

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,119
generate this kind of proof

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,799
uh that the car has been taken care of

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,039
and you know what it's been going on

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,959
it's an interesting way of solving that

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,640
annoying thing of negotiating prices and

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
you inject this amount of trust

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,640
this trusted record of a car and i think

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
it helps both sides the buyer knows that

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
they're getting a better car and the

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,640
seller

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
can sell it for a lot more it increases

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,480
the value of that car

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,239
rather than having to kind of discount

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,840
it for the unknown-ness of it so

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
there's all those examples of why it's

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
better to be it's good at software in

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,200
your business

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
right and i think what i want to focus

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
on here is you know we hear a lot about

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
what the developers need to do

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
they need to be more product oriented

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,640
but i think equally important and

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,160
especially

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
critical at the beginning is to make

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
sure that the infrastructure people the

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,879
operations people

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
also change how they're thinking about

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,040
the way they do uh they do

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,120
infrastructure

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,440
to match the needs of those development

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,040
teams uh working on all those kinds of

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,160
interesting software things and i'll get

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
to this concept

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,360
it's a shift in thinking to think about

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,840
the platform you're providing

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
as a product rather than a set of

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,400
services or

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,720
a deliverable or however you may be

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
thinking about it now just briefly

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,360
uh this is me uh everyone calls me cote

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,120
uh i've spent many of the past years

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,040
basically studying how large

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,720
organizations do what i was just going

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,519
over get better at software how they

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,159
start to use

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,760
software as the way they do innovation

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,120
for their business not just kind of

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
deliver

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,720
software that they're doing and kind of

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,440
even hone their own internal facing

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,519
things

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,360
but how they really match it up to the

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,200
way the organization functions whether

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,080
it's a commercial enterprise or a

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,159
government

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
and change how they're doing things so

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,159
if you've ever had discussions about

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
like

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,840
how do we start doing devops how do we

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
be more product oriented how do we

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
compete and how do we be a tech company

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
how do we become one of those

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,519
organizations that love to say

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
we're not a you know an xyz company

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,000
we're actually a software company that

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,920
just happens to sell xyz

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,360
you know that's the kind of thinking and

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,080
transformation i like to study and

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
there's a couple of

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
uh of these books that i've written over

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,040
the years i'm always working on a new

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,120
one that you can get for free

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,799
but if you just go to cote.io you can

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
check out that and i do a couple of

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,760
podcasts

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,080
feel free to dig in more if you're

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,479
interested in this type of content and

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
those kind of studies i i always

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,919
appreciate

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,359
the engagement with my brand let's first

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,400
kind of set up a model

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,919
of how i think people uh

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,080
how we see organizations that are

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,080
successfully transforming the way they

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,840
think about how they use i.t

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
transforming how they think about their

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
own software as a way to

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,199
innovate and run their business to be

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,720
successful whatever goals they have

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,960
and that is a lot of what's going on in

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,040
the application development cycle the

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,120
the cycle of using software to run your

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
business is shifting from a project way

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,040
of doing software

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,639
and by project way i mean here's a set

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,320
of requirements that we have

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,240
screens features uh user stories

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,880
personas user would like to this and

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,120
that

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,080
and as a development team you deliver

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,919
those features

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,840
to someone right like you implement them

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,759
out you deliver them you're done

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
right now of course you keep working on

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,360
it and troubleshooting

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
but you kind of just take what you're

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,880
asked to do and you deliver to that

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,720
now the opposite of that is as as we'll

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,639
get into is people are thinking more and

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,919
more about a product way in the same way

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
that a business would think about the

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,120
product that it has

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,800
it's constantly trying to think about

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,199
what problem are we solving

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
uh what what people are we selling to

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,720
what's the market how do we compete

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
you're always evolving or innovating

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
that business right and that's why i

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,400
keep saying innovation because it just

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,120
means

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
studying and adapting uh to what people

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
want to do

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,400
now to do software in that kind of way

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,440
it becomes very important depending on

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,039
what what you have up

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,800
everyone always thinks that they're an

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,400
exception and their stuff is is very

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,919
important and sometimes it is

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,840
if you're dealing with like you know

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,160
missiles or something like that

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,000
but generally organizations i see who

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,039
think about using software in a product

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,880
oriented way

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,080
they focus on delivering their software

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
on a weekly basis

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
if not more frequently and what they're

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,840
doing is because of that frequency

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,080
they're able to kind of explore and

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,160
innovate with code they're able to

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,919
study and react to what users are doing

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
more now to support that weekly

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,759
deployment

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,759
what people end up doing what they focus

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
a tremendous amount on and especially

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
if you're you know in the infrastructure

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,000
area think about what it takes

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
just to deploy one line of code right

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
like it usually takes much more than a

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
week

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,400
to get that line of code verify that

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,600
it's good make sure the developers have

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
built it

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
go through all the auditing that you

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,960
have uh and you know actually deploy it

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
down have all the meetings you need to

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,440
have right

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,280
and so that's the first thing the

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,960
critical thing uh that the world of

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
devops has been trying to solve over the

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
years is

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,880
how do we speed up the deployment

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
process

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,479
so that it still works right no one's

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
suggesting that you deploy garbage to

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,039
production

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,880
right how do we make sure that this

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,520
pipeline that we have

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,080
has as little waste as little delay in

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,919
as possible that allows our developers

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
and if you think about it the business

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,360
once those two of them

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,360
fit together well that allow us to get

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,400
new features into production rapidly

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,479
right and usually what developers find

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,639
what organizations find is that this

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
this uh value chain if you want to call

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,319
it that but this pipeline

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,240
has a lot of work that needs to go into

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,880
it to remove delay

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,720
and remove waste from the system and you

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,680
know there's an interesting i think it's

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,360
interesting to see

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,280
what perceptions are at the executive

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,560
layer the developer layer about what

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
needs to be addressed

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,599
but this is the main thing that

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,639
infrastructure people

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,080
probably uh in past years this year and

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,240
and years in the future need to figure

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,680
out is accelerating uh

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,520
that pipeline now remove

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,039
the first step is kind of analyzing all

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,560
the steps that you do again just

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,160
think about deploying one line of code

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,479
think about deploying even

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
your existing code to production right

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
what are all the steps you would need to

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
go through

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,400
and really honing and perfecting that is

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
the first stage

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,599
that infrastructure people are getting

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,599
to when they want to support this

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,720
product driven way of thinking about

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
software

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
now it's kind of ridiculous like we've

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
always focused on

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,879
automating and speeding up deployment

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,000
right a lot of focus as we've gotten

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,759
into now

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
when it comes to that pipeline of

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,039
writing your code and getting it

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,720
securely and reliably running in

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,720
production also comes down

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
to those last two things like security

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,879
and reliability right like how do we

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,879
remove

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,039
human error not only delay and speed

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
things up and way back when i was still

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,000
a programmer

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,279
right like there were a whole bunch of

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,599
automation frameworks

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,959
you know like bladelogic opsware all

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,039
sorts of things like that

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,839
i love this poster it like represents

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,880
everything about early 2000s uh software

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,800
development

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,800
super awesome that robot person and the

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,640
floating icons

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
but even back then we were trying to

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,720
reduce down um

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,240
that pipeline right and you know i was

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
writing a lot of the code for it and a

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,839
first-hand witness to this a lot of what

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,160
we got bogged down to is is really

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,160
focusing too much on that pipeline

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,760
and too much reliance on it and too much

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,240
of our own process and

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,560
i see this all the time even now is that

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,279
it's a very again project mentality

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,200
where you're thinking about in in uh it

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,279
and in the ops infrastructure area i'm

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,200
delivering a set of services

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,040
we have specified ahead of time what the

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
availability of those services are what

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,519
quotas you have what the costs are

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
what the response times to tickets are

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,080
and really what we're delivering

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,959
is this is kind of a meta layer we're

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
delivering

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
a service right whatever that service

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,480
does

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
isn't really what our job is our job is

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
to meet that criteria that we had

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
delivered

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,480
and if that service is useful or not

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,399
like it's not really

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
our concern it was originally when we

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,000
came up with all this it service

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,839
management and itel things

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
but people kind of revert down to what

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
they're measured by and what you get

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
measured by

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,040
again are those basics of the service

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,600
right

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
and especially like evolving it changing

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
that service and modifying is a whole

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,519
other

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,440
set of difficulty now over the years and

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,760
devops is largely a reaction to this

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
right that we we need to evolve the

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,560
software that we have at a rapid clip so

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
we also need to

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,079
evolve the way that we do operations to

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,240
constantly be

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,839
improving and getting better and not

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
just sort of

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,519
representing that it's doing a good job

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,760
that all of its metrics are green

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,720
and so we had devops come in and true to

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,880
its name kind of

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
fold in not only operations into

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,200
development but to make developers kind

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,399
of go back into the operations area

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
and more and more think about

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
infrastructure as part of their

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,040
application which which is a great step

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,880
and where we are now is a lot of that

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,800
has been codified after a lot of

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,320
squabbling out in the industry over the

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
past five or six years about what the

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,440
standard would be

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,519
but the standard for how new software

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,560
and increasingly modernized software is

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,519
run and even how it's architected is

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,240
based on

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
essentially container driven development

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
or

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
you know kubernetes is the technology

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,279
that's used nowadays

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,160
and what that is is to very much so

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,920
simplify it

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,079
it's a a platform it's a runtime layer

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,240
for running containerized applications

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,000
can basically distributed applications

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,920
that are put into containers

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
and that coordinate with each other over

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,040
the network hence the distributed

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
application part now we used to call

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,079
that an soa

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,399
it had its own type way of doing things

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,040
enterprise service buses fit into there

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,560
but nowadays we're kind of reinventing

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
this idea of how distributed

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
applications the different modules work

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
with each other

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
uh over things called service meshes i

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
mean some similar principles apply but

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
it's a new set of technologies

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,120
so this is a huge shift of that

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,880
infrastructure layer

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,880
that definitely we see at vmware and

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
we've been working on for for quite some

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,959
time

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,600
uh is we have now this platform right so

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,480
what does it mean

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
instead of managing an automation set of

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,800
services

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,920
even kind of a static more pre-cloud

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,480
cloud if you will

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,040
how does operations infrastructure vi

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
admins

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,839
change what they do well let's let's get

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,320
right into it and again i think the

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,440
focus needs to be purely on

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,880
how are we satisfying that need of our

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
organization to deliver

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,920
custom software well right like how do

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,560
we

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
evolve the platform that we have to

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,839
match the evolving needs

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
of those developers right those examples

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,760
of applications that i was going up

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,079
earlier now

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
this loop right like a lot of what i've

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
been talking about

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,360
is evolving uh and changing what the

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
nature of those services are rather than

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,560
deploying to

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
a static set of requirements and needs

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,279
right

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,720
and this small batch loop this way of

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,920
innovating and discovering the new

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
things you need to do

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,760
is also done by the developers and

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,600
essentially what it says and you'll hear

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,079
people talk about learning organizations

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,480
a lot

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,440
and things like that is it brings back

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
this notion

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,959
of a learning organization of constant

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,160
discovery of lean product management i'm

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
just kind of throwing out all these

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,839
words in case you know

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,040
know what they are back to the

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,200
operations area

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,200
where your operations people when

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,040
they're building this platform

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,560
and when they're extending that platform

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,079
they're not only running it

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,560
but they're constantly coming up with a

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,760
hypothesis a theory of what's new

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
functionality

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,120
that we could add to this platform that

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,760
will make our customers

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,440
jobs better right so in the same way

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,800
that the application developers are

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
thinking about what are new features

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
that we can add to our applications to

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
make

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
our customers the customer of the

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,839
organization or your internal users of

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,279
internal facing software

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,279
how do we change the features in the

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,720
software how do we move pixels on the

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,240
screens to make it better

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
the infrastructure people now are

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
thinking about those development teams

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,600
as their customers

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,440
and they're constantly trying out and

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,199
studying new things and thinking about

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,199
how do we make our customers the

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,000
developers successful

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,720
now obviously the number one story and

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,639
requirement

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,160
of all of these people is the stuff

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
should work right like

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,120
if you're kind of reacting to this and

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,000
thinking like oh that means it's not

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,240
going to work

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,760
there's a problem in in what's going on

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
there right so

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
you know a lot of what we do uh in the

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,360
industry is we're trying to constantly

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,839
figure out the best

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,199
type of platform the best software and

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,560
kind of learning from things that work

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,639
and don't work and put that into our

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,920
kubernetes distro kind of the advice

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,760
that we give out

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,519
so people using this obviously you need

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,079
to rely on tools and practices that are

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
good

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
but the concept that i want to focus on

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,160
is not so much that day-to-day thing but

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,959
this mentality

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,560
of we are going to run our platform as a

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,959
product and reorient the way that we

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,519
think

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,120
and and the way uh the way that we

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,240
specify what our job is not just

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
delivering a service

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,519
so when you're doing this the key thing

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
is again as you might think so we need

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,399
to put uh

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,160
again at the moment a kubernetes

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,839
platform in place we need to have the

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,279
middleware that the developers use the

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,160
set of services

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,160
the databases the event cues whatever

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,240
and we also need to uh

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
have that pipeline so we deliver that

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,360
build pipeline to them right that's part

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
of the infrastructure that you're

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
delivering that you even collaborate

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,839
with developers on

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,920
and as you look at this more and more a

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,440
lot of the security and the reliability

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,519
the traditional things

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
that operations people do to make the

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,959
infrastructure work to do their core job

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,880
uh is done by having that good build

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,800
pipeline right that way of taking the

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,800
code that the developers have

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,000
making sure it's built and containerized

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,079
making sure that you have all the

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
right configuration that you have

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,279
automating a lot of the release

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
management to get it in production

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,959
and also making sure that it's been

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,720
instrumented along the way that you have

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,759
the right hooks in the code the right

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,680
apis

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,440
that allow you to monitor and manage it

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,800
in production and then to go do that

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,160
cycle over again

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,920
right so again even what i'm going over

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,519
you can see that as an infrastructure

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,839
people you're no longer

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,120
only in charge of just you know running

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,880
your vsphere install

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,959
right of keeping it up and running of

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
collecting what the new storage

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,399
requirements are kind of like building

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,440
this raw infrastructure

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:06,079
you have this this almost passion this

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,759
product management mindset of studying

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,000
what it is the developers needs

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,800
and trying to improve what their jobs

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,399
are right so

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,000
that's why you start to think more and

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,360
more about the build pipeline in

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,720
addition to the infrastructure that

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
you're providing

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
because it's not really up to developers

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,759
what using the build pipeline thing like

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,360
that's not really what they're

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,040
delivering right they're delivering

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
moving pixels on the screen

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,639
so that build pipeline becomes part of

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,680
the platform that you have right the way

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,759
that they

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,959
containerize their applications and run

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,720
it in kubernetes

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,320
is not really moving pixels on the

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
screen that's part of the infrastructure

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,199
you're providing

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,279
the way that all the components in their

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,320
applications communicate with each other

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,920
over the network becomes part of

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,519
again not how they move pixels on the

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
screen that becomes part of the platform

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,519
that you are providing

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,920
right so all of this you can see goes up

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,759
and up the stack from raw infrastructure

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,000
but more importantly as you study and

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,000
work with these these developers

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,440
you learn how to evolve the platform for

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,959
the needs they have and

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
it's going to be specific to each

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,199
organization that you're in right the

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,640
needs that one large bank has will look

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
kind of similar to the needs that

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,000
another large bank has

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,079
but the backend processing systems that

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,240
they have the existing erp systems that

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,799
they work on to do customer retrieval

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,760
the data privacy concerns that they have

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,559
how they deal

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,799
with uh regional banks across the world

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,799
and

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,720
integrate across many different uh

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,559
markets or countries that they have

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
these needs tend to be somewhat unique

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,080
technologically and again they become

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,400
features of that platform that you're

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,960
providing another phrase people like to

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,880
use is enterprise architecture

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
so what you're going to do and i see

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,840
this over and over again so i feel

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,480
pretty confident being prescriptive

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,880
about it

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,400
is you're going to build a product team

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,000
that's building that product as a

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,320
platform and you're going to start to be

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,559
applying this notion of how do we

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,679
think about developers as our customers

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
and really product

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,799
manage the infrastructure that we're

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,919
doing not just

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,440
specify and write up a bunch of slas but

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,320
we are delivering a product to the

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,559
customers

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,080
and you know you'll find a lot of

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,360
success if you take this approach

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,640
rather than just dumping a cloud out to

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,520
them rather than just kind of

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,720
setting up a kubernetes instance or an

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,480
internal cloud

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,919
uh and just assuming that because you

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,760
deliver this and mandate that this is

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,160
the infrastructure that they use

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,520
uh like people don't really do that we

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
call this you know from that old movie

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,440
field of dreams they build it and they

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,799
will come

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,520
fallacy and this happens over and over

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,120
again

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,640
that without really product managing

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,320
what customers are doing you kind of

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
miss out on delivering what they

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,880
actually need

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,919
rather than what you specified so

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,679
let me uh go over so getting that

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,520
mentality in place right i want to go

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,720
over just a few

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,000
common hurdles or tactics uh that that

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,640
people encounter right and this is

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
really

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,280
the types of things that i get most

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,919
interested in encountering right because

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,400
it's easy

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,360
as i've done to go over like all right

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,400
so instead of

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,039
delivering uh services your your kind of

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
uh

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,720
internal cloud or whatever you want to

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,600
call it your big chunk of virtualized

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,840
infrastructure

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,000
and networking and storage and just kind

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,679
of like providing a grocery store of

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,360
infrastructure to people

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,120
to your developers instead you need to

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,200
product manage it and work with them

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,480
and kind of study what it is they need

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,799
and always be evolving that

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,919
infrastructure to fit their needs

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,200
it sounds wonderful right but getting

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,160
that in place in an existing

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,720
organization is

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,919
is very difficult uh for most places and

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
hopefully you can learn

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,640
um from what other people have struggled

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
through and i'll just go over a few of

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
those and there's always some more and

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,240
i'm always

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,160
very curious to hear what problems uh

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,919
you're having other people are having

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,120
and also i mean if you've got a solution

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,039
that's also nice to hear

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,320
but really understanding what issues

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,880
people have as they do this

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,240
i think is helpful for all of us to have

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,919
and to share

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,760
so first and this is advice that applies

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,760
also to the application developers and

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,240
to i.t as a whole

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,000
what i really notice is that many

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,000
organizations

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,400
for various reasons a lot of them having

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,640
to do with kind of urgency

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,240
a little bit of bravado but also kind of

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
making the business case right that if

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600
we're

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
of doing big transformation they want to

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
do

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,200
everything at once they want to do big

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,000
bang transformation right we're just

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
going to switch over

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,039
everything in the first year but this

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,520
really

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,760
doesn't work very well right sometimes

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:31,120
it works like we have a customer

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,120
back in the states comcast that

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,880
seems like they've done a pretty big

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,520
switch over all at once but

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,039
in general it doesn't work out very well

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,600
and instead what i see organizations

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,360
doing not only at the application layer

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,960
but at the infrastructure layer right

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,799
and also at the managerial layer

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,039
as i talk about when i go over cultural

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,919
things is instead what they focus on is

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,720
they focus on

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,520
starting small right so they pick

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,200
literally

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,440
one project maybe two or three projects

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,039
and they have that platform in place

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,360
right and in our instance they have the

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,400
tonzu stack in place uh kubernetes stack

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,320
in place with the

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,320
the various types of middleware and and

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,840
thinking about that build pipeline and

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,760
the practices that they use this

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,600
platform as a product approach and

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,600
the the um product management approach

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,520
that they have on the development teams

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,720
and they pick a project and they start

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,280
with that right just

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,760
one project now this project needs to be

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,679
um

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,960
to use some more jargon business facing

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,640
right so it shouldn't just be like a

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,799
conference room scheduling app

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,799
or something like that it needs to be

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,640
something that actually is used by

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
the business again internally facing or

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,840
externally facing i find

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,520
initial projects like this are often

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,760
things like build presentment

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,240
uh even a store finder app or a

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,760
an atm finder app there's an example

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,039
from the home depot where the software

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,880
used for the

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,039
the custom paint mixing you know you go

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,960
in and you want to match some paint to

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,559
some other color the software they use

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
to run that they use that

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,760
but you start with a small project like

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,559
this and

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,840
what's important is that you learn from

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,840
what you're doing right you're not going

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,159
to get everything right the first time

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,760
the developers the infrastructure people

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
management especially

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,120
right is going to need to learn how to

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
do things in this new way they're going

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,919
to need to try

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,760
one method of delivering things right do

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,400
we deliver deliver every week or every

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,679
two weeks

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,679
do we make people use a build pipeline

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,039
or do we allow them to customize it what

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,640
programming language is good what

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
approach to doing this is good how do we

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
set

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,559
slas or service level objectives if you

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,799
want to be all

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,159
google site reliability engineering i

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,600
realize those two aren't the same thing

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,280
but you know how do we

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
what kind of working relationship do we

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,159
have between all the layers how do we

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,600
organize the teams

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,960
you're going to have to discover a lot

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,240
of that on your own there's some general

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
patterns but that

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,159
let's use the 80 20 that 20 that's

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,600
specialized to you you're gonna have to

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,200
learn from it right and it's better to

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,360
have a small amount of projects that you

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,840
learn from than one large one

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
now the important part also of starting

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
small

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,919
is that as you build up a success with

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,200
these small teams you have people

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,280
developers

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,120
infrastructure people managers and as

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,480
you get more and more projects as

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,720
as you kind of see with this curve

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,600
that's going up you take select people

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,799
who generally

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,320
are people people they know how to talk

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,960
with people and they're outgoing they

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
kind of

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,520
can communicate you take some of them

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,520
and you seed them into the new teams

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,600
right so you're spreading that knowledge

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
into new teams so that each new team

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,039
doesn't have to learn from scratch

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
and you know you know how that spread

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,440
works of either people talking about the

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,919
shampoo that they use in the 80s or

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,520
more of a exponential spread of things

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,799
as you build up more and more people on

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
those teams you have more and more

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,000
people to seed and you can spread out to

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,320
more and more teams and grow out

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,679
right so the key thing there is that

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,120
kind of bottoms up

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,480
uh i wouldn't call it bottoms up

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,080
necessarily because it's managed by

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,360
executives but that seated way of

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,039
growing and indeed

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,559
if you look in the recent devops reports

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,200
when they've studied uh

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,039
successful scaling up large scale change

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,000
that seeding approach also works really

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,240
well

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
um so that's something that we see over

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
and over again that i've seen

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,440
in our our larger customers is they

00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,720
really follow that approach of getting

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,159
a couple of knowledgeable people

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,600
starting with small projects once you

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,600
have success with that project start

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,520
more and seed people out there

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,720
and this same thing happens with the way

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,679
that you're thinking about doing

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,480
platform work

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,039
uh right that the the the teams that you

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,640
set up

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,080
will be the initial ones working on

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,600
these initial projects and they'll be

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,360
understanding how to do that that

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
platform as a product how to run things

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
in a new way

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,440
and the important thing is to take those

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,880
learnings and fold it back into there

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,440
now that brings us to uh the next thing

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
that's important if you think about it

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,360
just a little bit

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,919
as you're adding more and more

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,240
developers using this new platform right

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,679
this uh this kubernetes substrate with

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
uh all the middleware

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,240
and service mesh stuff on top of it the

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,240
build pipeline that you'll be using

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,760
you infrastructure people in the

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,000
platform team

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,760
again it's been shown many over the past

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,120
years of large organizations i've talked

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
with

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,960
that you're going to be doing a lot of

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,919
consulting a lot more consulting

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,520
than even you realize me saying that so

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
i see this in places like

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,320
bt duke energy uh all sorts of

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,000
organizations uh

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
that are doing this is they actually

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,080
have to budget a couple of people

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,120
at least for the first year if if not

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,640
more people

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,480
to just go out and work with those

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,400
developer teams to consult with them to

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,240
be embedded on those teams for a few

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
releases maybe a month or two

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
to explain to them not only how to use

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,400
the platform how to use the build

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
pipeline

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,080
but it's also a great way to learn about

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,679
your customer and evolve that

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,120
so definitely budget out for that that

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,400
you're going to be doing consulting not

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,840
just sort of uh

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,600
telling people how the service should

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,240
work and the the old

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,960
sort of everyone's favorite rtfm way of

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,360
educating

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,960
the users of your your infrastructure

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,679
now the other side of this and this

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,840
applies to

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,240
the organization as a whole but a lot of

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,640
the times like for example with bt i see

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
the infrastructure people leading this

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
is every quarter

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,440
you're going to want to have an internal

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,960
conference nowadays when things are

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,480
online you can kind of get away with a

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,000
half day conference when

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,360
people get back to being face to face

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,240
it's good for it to be a day-long

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,320
conference

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,240
uh where you bring in people and you can

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
do this regionally you can move around

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,440
or if you're more centralized

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
you can have it in a more centralized

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
place but every quarter you want to have

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,360
an internal conference where

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,880
you're basically educating people about

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,360
this new platform you have

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
this new way of operating and you have

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,159
those existing small teams right that

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,320
you started with

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,400
they start to present their experience

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,559
right and this internal conference

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,240
it's not only training right which is

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,720
what you need to get people to

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,880
uh understand how to use the platform

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,039
but it's two other things it's also

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
um marketing really something that i

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,440
don't think a lot of

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,200
infrastructure people would think about

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,279
but you do have to market people's

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
interest in using that platform

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,880
draw them into it and get them

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,320
passionate and interested about using it

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,240
but it's also that third thing the

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,000
product part where you're directly

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,360
engaging with your customers and your

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,799
prospects if you will

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
the development teams and even

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,320
enterprise architects and auditors that

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,840
you want to operate in this new way

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,600
and it's a good chance for you to meet

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,039
them and talk with them and see what

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,799
their requirements are

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,559
to start working with them more and more

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,000
right so again a lot of what we're

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,360
talking about here

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,960
is and i i'm you know exaggerating when

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,360
i say things like this is

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,039
no longer working with your customers

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,360
with people through ticket desks

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,559
and change review board meetings kind of

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,080
through process

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,840
but working with them in the same way

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,600
that a product driven company tech

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,600
companies work with their customers

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,799
is really understanding and interacting

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,919
with them and understanding what their

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,799
needs are and that

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,480
is what i think it really means to think

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,679
about as a platform as a product and

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,080
obviously evolve

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,279
the platform to uh based on those

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,720
insights that you have

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,320
let me just close out with one other

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,880
thing right and

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,000
i think that is that when you're doing

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,559
things this way you still

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
need to collect metrics right so there's

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,799
all other performance metrics

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,600
obviously um and these words change over

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,000
time but

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
the that it works whether that's

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,080
availability

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,440
mean time to repair you know uptime is

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,159
can be good or can be

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,919
like not accurate but you know is the

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,159
raw infrastructure you're providing

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,919
does it work right like people may

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,440
debate about should we talk about uptime

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,320
anymore but we certainly talk about

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,640
downtime

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,399
when when that occurs right so you know

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,159
a lot of the focus is on more like mean

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,520
time to repair and resilience but

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,120
you know there's all those technical

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,720
metrics that are worth looking into but

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
you also need to start tracking

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
let's call them outcome metrics right

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,919
what are the metrics

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,760
that we have that are indicating that

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,760
our efforts our transformation is

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,360
working right how many people are moving

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,200
over to the platform

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,120
what are the the product teams the

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,840
developers team's satisfaction

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,440
uh with the platform are by using this

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,760
platform are they actually moving their

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,000
applications to production right

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,000
so you want to moder mode and monitor

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,919
the usefulness of what you're doing

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,080
not just again as i was saying at the

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,159
beginning that you are delivering it

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,600
successful right even if all your

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,679
dashboard is green

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,279
and no one is using your platform or

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,640
getting any value from it

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,399
even if you've done perfectly and the

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,679
dashboard is green you're not really

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,440
successful at it

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,799
so as there's a great talk from td

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,440
ameritrade about how they were

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,440
monitoring

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,720
the rollout and measuring the roll out

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,840
of this that i would really recommend

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,520
looking into

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
if not using the metrics that they did

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,840
to measure what what how the team was

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,200
functioning

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,360
to start to get in your mind how you

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
would come up uh with those metrics uh

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,960
so with that

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,039
um you know there's there's a a longer

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,279
sort of brain dump that you can find

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,799
uh about all of these topics even more

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,520
things i go more in depth about what

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,440
platform

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,559
operations and platform as a service

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
looks like there's a

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,840
a good recording of that uh you know you

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,159
can see

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,080
zany me there uh and like i mentioned

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,080
you there i discussed this topic and

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,360
even more topics the developers and the

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,000
managerial layer

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,960
uh in the two books that i have and uh

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,640
the little uh

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,240
videos and overviews all sorts of

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
content if you're interested in more

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,399
if you go to cote.pizza a real domain

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,559
name you can find

00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
links to all those things and i'm always

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,679
happy to talk with people you can reach

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
