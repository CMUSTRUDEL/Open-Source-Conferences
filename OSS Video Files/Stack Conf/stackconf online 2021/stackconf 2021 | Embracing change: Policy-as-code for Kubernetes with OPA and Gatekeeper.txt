	by Ara Pulido

As more enterprises migrate to cloud native environments like Kubernetes the need for more scalable ways to define and enforce fine-grained policies increases: how can I limit the number of replicas of a pod for certain users? how can I ensure that all images come from trusted registries? Gatekeeper, a CNCF project, allows to define policy as Kubernetes objects, making it easier to adopt policy-as-code practices in Kubernetes environments and sharing reusable policy templates. In this talk we will demo Gatekeeper for Kubernetes environments. You will learn how to adopt policy-as-code techniques and how you can integrate Gatekeeper with your existing tools.
