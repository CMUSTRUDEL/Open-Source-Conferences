Part of the job of a Developer Advocate is the ability to demo or show off portions of your technology stack to possible users. At IBM this is no different for us, but there is a gap on the scale of what our requirements are and what the provisioning of our cloud infrastructure was. In this talk we will describe our situation, our iterations on what we tried and the painful portions of them, and how we accidentally created a Cloud interface on top of the IBM Cloud, or easier said, we created a Cloud on our Cloud.
Ideally, we will show our journey and the lessons we learned along the way, and as an audience member, you will come away with nuggets of useful tooling to make your cloud usage more streamlined, and hopefully, you will see the pitfalls we fell in and you can avoid them yourself. We will show off some bad code, some good code, and some robust code; all open source and available to allow you to leverage it too.
