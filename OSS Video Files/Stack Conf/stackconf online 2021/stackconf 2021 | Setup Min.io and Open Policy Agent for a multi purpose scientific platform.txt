At the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) an effort is being made in leveraging modern cloud-native paradigms to build the scientific analysis infrastructure of the future. The talk will focus on the adopted storage platform that is based on Min.io with a fine grained authorization model obtained by the combination of the AWS STS authentication flow and the native integration with the OpenPolicyAgent. Moreover, a set of tools have been developed to allow users to access data with different mode spanning from the canonical S3 APIs until a POSIX like experience.
