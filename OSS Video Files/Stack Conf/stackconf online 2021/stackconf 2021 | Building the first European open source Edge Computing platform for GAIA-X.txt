Title: stackconf 2021 | Building the first European open source Edge Computing platform for GAIA-X
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: stackconf online 2021
Description: 
	by Alberto Marti

Edge Computing is becoming increasingly popular nowadays thanks to the growing availability of cloud, bare-metal and 5G providers offering flexible and affordable access to edge resources around the globe. The idea is based on moving core computational processes and storage to distant locations that are closer to the entities they interact with, like end-users and IoT devices. The benefits come from improving network latency and user experience, reducing security risks, and minimizing data transfers to central cloud locations. Thanks to the €2.1M awarded in 2019 by the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Program, OpenNebula has developed the first open source Edge Computing platform in Europe. This talk analyses the benefits and challenges associated with Edge Computing, introduces the “True Hybrid Cloud” concept, and explores how this new EU-funded Edge Computing platform contributes to consolidate Europe’s digital sovereignty by integrating other relevant European open source technologies and by providing future access to the GAIA-X federated infrastructure.

to tell you more details about the the

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,000
work we've been doing at open airline

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,800
lately

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,559
and how we're planning to connect our

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,600
edge computing technology to gaia x

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,399
so those are my contact details if you

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,160
have any

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
additional questions afterwards if you

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,600
want to send me a follow-up email

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
just feel free to contact me i live in a

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,920
small village in eastern spain it's

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
called

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,920
shabia you might be familiar with the

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,160
place um

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,760
actually it's just a few hours away from

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,920
from mallorca so

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,719
i guess not that far away from german

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,719
territory right

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
okay so um some background information

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,320
about open ebla

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,560
um we are european open source company

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
we are based in madrid we were born in

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,159
2008 as the

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,600
first european open source

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,040
infrastructure as a service

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,000
solution um we feel especially proud of

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,360
being

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,080
an example of european innovation and

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,119
also really thankful to the european

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,119
commission for the

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
the support we've received from them

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
over the years

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
um we're also in that sense an example

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,119
of european funding

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
well invested and that's been helpful

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
for us to

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,159
to develop new features and and innovate

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,840
as we

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,880
we move uh beyond the public cloud

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,680
to the edge as i'll explain in a second

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,280
um we're also members of a number of

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,079
open source initiatives international

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
initiatives like

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,960
libny explanations cncf and obviously

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,240
also corporate members of the european

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,399
open science cloud

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,399
and they were members of gaia x

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
so for those of you who already know

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,319
benevolent um

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,319
as i mentioned we we come from the

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,599
private cloud so traditionally up

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,680
enabler has been a

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,400
tool for organizations and companies to

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,080
set up their own cloud on premises so

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
using the infrastructure resources they

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
had on premises

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,440
so on top of those they they used to set

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,280
up

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
an environment which they offer virtual

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
machines and

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
resources to different research groups

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
or

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,560
departments or teams within the the

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,840
company

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,200
um part of the work we've been doing

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,319
since 2019 with the support from the

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,239
european commission

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
and it's been expanding these

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,720
capabilities

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,360
and some of that involves as well

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,440
managing

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
application containers now directly from

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,720
open nebula

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,400
um deploying and managing your

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,440
kubernetes clusters as well

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,760
from open nebula and moving beyond the

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,800
data center so now organizations using

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,319
open nebula

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,080
can actually provision resources

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,800
from third party providers

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,800
both on the public cloud and on the edge

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,640
before i move on i'm going to introduce

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,840
momo to you which is my cat which is

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,319
actually now

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,840
in a kind of sour touch mission so say

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,840
hello and goodbye goodbye

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,200
okay so um

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,560
yeah so all these changes we've been

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,239
doing all this innovation has been

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,720
guided by

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
some principles we're trying to respect

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,519
we've been trying to implement during

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,760
these years which is

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,239
helping our users to avoid vendor

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,120
locking both at the provided level

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,760
but also at the technology level so even

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,080
open source technologies can

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
generate a vendor lock in a scenario

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
they're

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,560
we think unnecessarily complex for

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,319
instance so

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,599
that's we always try to make things as

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
simple as possible

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,720
minimize complexity making it simple for

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
people to

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
deploy the product use it maintain it

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
and also obviously

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,759
as well for users um

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,479
we try to build open nebula around this

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
principle

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,960
and also about the principle of reducing

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,880
the resources you need for the

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,880
for the product and also reducing the

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
operational costs once you've deployed

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
the

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
resolution on your on your premises

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
so in terms of the technologies we use

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,040
and we support

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
um so coming from the private cloud

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
we've been

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,120
supporting obviously virtual machines

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,479
technologies like kvm

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,960
um but also vsphere for instance

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,919
now we support vsphere 7 for people who

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,840
want to keep

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
their vmware infrastructure at the

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,840
virtualization

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
layer and on top of that deploy and

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,919
create their own

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,080
private cloud using open nebula

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,280
we also support linux system containers

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
lxc

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,960
and the latest integration has been

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
firecracker

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,160
so firecracker is um it's a new

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
virtualization technology an open source

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,680
one has been developed by

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,240
aws for some of their services and

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
it's been really handy for us because

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,240
it's

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,919
it's allowed us to deploy

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
application containers as i explain a

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,039
second

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,479
directly as micro vms so on top of these

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,240
technologies you can use other tools for

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,759
for managing your infrastructure like

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,600
terraform or ansible

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,520
and also as i mentioned kubernetes or

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,360
docker

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
so what you you end up having is an

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,199
environment with a number of options and

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,560
integrations with other technologies

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
that comes with a native

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,039
multi-tenancy a self-service portal for

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,639
your users

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,160
allows you to define a number of

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,039
elasticity

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,639
rules for for different services and

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,160
complex services you might want to to

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
deploy in your cloud

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,319
for these services to react to what's

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
what's happening in real time with your

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,199
infrastructure as well and the

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,800
the demand from your users you consider

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,240
a high high availability environment

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,919
you can federate resources from

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,440
different locations and different data

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
centers

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,120
we had a user for instance with

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,600
around two hundred thousand cores across

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
uh

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,800
i mistaken i think it was uh

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,680
12 data centers or 13 data centers all

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,479
around the world so

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
so quite a big infrastructure there um

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
you can also provision

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,440
as i mentioned resources from other

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,800
providers from external providers create

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,199
your multi-cloud environment

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,560
and on top of that manage vms and

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,759
application containers

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,759
all from the same place

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,000
the way we manage containers is one of

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,280
these

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,039
main novelties and it's a quite nice

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,360
beautiful solution we got there i think

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,639
um it involves

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,039
an integration with the docker half

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,160
marketplace now from nebula

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,120
and then we are able now to run

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
docker images as firecracker micro vms

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
so

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,440
in a one-to-one relationship um that

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
gives us the

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,680
opportunity to leverage all the

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,919
capabilities that were already present

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,000
in open nebula for regular vms but now

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,560
for application containers so

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
with the additional isolation and

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,199
security that involves

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,720
uh virtualization so that's uh that's

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
been quite useful for

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
for for x deployments for instance when

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
you want to reduce

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,960
different layers and the complexity of

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,960
the technology you're using for your

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,280
edge deployment

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,800
obviously if if you need kubernetes

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
you can you can deploy that as well on

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
top of europe enabler cloud

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
either with our cncf certified

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,000
kubernetes appliance

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,879
or with the new k3s appliance which we

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
find very

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,360
very handy and very useful as well for

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,360
for the edge

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,879
once you have your kubernetes clusters

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
you can obviously manage them with

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,360
different tools

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,160
including range which is one of the

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
integrations we

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,120
so this is how a graphical user

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,680
interface looks this is the

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,400
standard interface for for admins and

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,479
also for

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,560
for end users and this is the new

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,240
graphical user interface for the

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
provisioning the new provisioning tool

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,560
the one that helps you

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,560
deploy infrastructure operation

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,159
infrastructure from different providers

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
and this is a catalog that will be

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,279
expanding with different drivers

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,920
for for more more uh cloud and edge

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,000
providers in the future

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,000
so what enabler creates is a it's an

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,720
abstraction layer on top of the

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,560
the complexities and the apis of these

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
individual providers so you can actually

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,920
deploy

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,360
your workload across different providers

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,360
with no

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
additional complexities there

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,600
so this is the project we are

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,880
we are working on right now this is a

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,760
project um

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,959
from the horizon 2020 program that we

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,839
started in november

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
2019 and it's going to be running till

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,760
march

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,800
next year and this is uh

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,000
how we are expanding open nebula from

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,040
the private cloud

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,399
beyond the data center and we are uh

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,040
turning up enebla into

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,519
an open source the first european open

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,839
source

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,200
edge computing platform all thanks to

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,920
obviously the support from the

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
from the commission

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,880
so why it's computing so why turning a

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
solution for the private cloud into into

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,839
an edge computing one

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,080
um well when we um proposed

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
this project to the commission um a few

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,560
years ago

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
we had really realized that edge

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
computing was actually going to become a

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
thing

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,240
so not just a password as we've

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
we've seen sometimes but actually

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,839
something a technology and a new

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,880
paradigm that was going to

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,839
to bring a deep disruption to the cloud

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
market

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
disruption in the sense that it's going

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,480
to change the way

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,560
users interact with the cloud what the

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,640
expectations they have from the cloud

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
but also the way in which

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,560
the ecosystem the cloud ecosystem and

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
the cloud provider ecosystem works now

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,440
and it's organized now

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,440
so that's what we thought was uh

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
after several years working on open

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,519
nebula uh

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,640
as a as a private cloud solution

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,279
we thought it was absolutely uh

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,000
worth it uh doing this transition and

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,160
this evolution

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,440
of the product into into an open source

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,440
edge computing platform as well

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:59,040
so eth computing brings a number of

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,959
of benefits and is going to bring some

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,839
some major benefits to

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,560
to users and companies uh in different

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,920
sectors i mean

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,600
in all different sectors in which we

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,240
operate now we see

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
the application of edge computing in in

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,519
the near future

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,120
things like the deployment of low

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
latency or ultra low latency

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,920
applications

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,560
very close to the to the end user or the

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,399
the iot device or the mobile device

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,480
um things like improving the user

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
experience in some in some sectors this

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,399
is this is crucial things like

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,440
gaming for instance or smart health

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,839
that's going to be

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
really important expanding service

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,240
availability

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,000
so being able to deploy a cloud that

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,920
can actually leverage different

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,480
infrastructure resources and adapt to

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
that

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,920
deployment depending on what's going on

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
with that infrastructure and

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,639
impossible incidents um we're talking

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,519
about reducing data transfers

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
and the security risks involved in that

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,720
and

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,480
also the energy consumption involved in

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,959
data transfers

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,440
we're talking about for companies mainly

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,399
in europe we think it's going to bring

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,680
a tool for minimizing their dependency

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,560
on some vendors

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,279
and specifically on some hyperscalers

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
and

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,360
on the same at the same time it's going

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,160
to help europe

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
develop its its own local ecosystem of

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,440
infrastructure providers mainly

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,720
with new edge providers in that way

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:30,399
strengthening we think um the

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
eu digital sovereignty

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,720
we are seeing already some of this

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,920
element um

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:43,200
happening specifically at the 5g market

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,000
and they bring some some interesting

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
lessons and

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,480
things worth analyzing that for a second

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,120
so

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,079
what we've seen recently in the past few

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,480
months is

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,040
an increasingly aggressive strategy by

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,320
hyperscalers

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,720
to position themselves

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,000
in europe specifically but also in other

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,959
places

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
as its providers so um

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,519
reaching agreements in this in this way

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,519
with with telecommunication companies

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,320
and using 5g providers

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
infrastructures and networks to offer

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
this edge computing

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
services to to their customers i think

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
it was

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:34,480
yesterday that aws and vodafone

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,959
officially launched their aws wavelength

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,000
program

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,880
in the uk had been announced a few

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,720
months ago but

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,800
they they had this formal announcement

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,519
yesterday and and this is the model we

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
see in

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,639
in some of the with some other operators

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
as well in the

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,440
telco telecommunications sector so

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,279
hyperscalers placing

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,959
the physical infrastructure within the

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,560
5g networks

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,920
and the the facilities of the operators

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,399
and using their traditional portals and

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,120
tools

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,600
for customers to use these new resources

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,639
at the

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:13,120
5g edge that comes with

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,560
some pros and cons i mean it's a very

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
quick way to

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,880
to deploy edge resources and make them

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
available for customers

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,920
but the there's a risk as well so this

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
these companies are actually

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,079
um running some some risks here in terms

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,360
of

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:36,720
they might end up becoming a provider of

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,240
connectivity and and facilities for

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,880
for hyperscalers and that's something

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,839
that's not owning the edge in that sense

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
also comes with

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,279
with a potential risk for them in the in

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
the midterm but

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,240
let's see what happens

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,519
our perspective um is more

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,199
in line with what the european

00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,800
commission has been declaring lately

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,800
that as

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,160
its computing becomes a reality

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,639
europe specifically needs to strengthen

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,600
its

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,279
technological capabilities and develop

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,959
its technological sovereignty

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,240
um and we evaluate the the

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,399
impact and the dependency on

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
non-eu technologies and providers like

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,399
typically hyperscalers

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,920
and we obviously agree with the

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
statement that open source can

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,920
actually help to to do this so that's

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,320
why we are developing

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
um a european open source technology and

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,800
the idea is to

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,519
for this technology to empower the cloud

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,720
and edge

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,720
ecosystem in europe

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,480
um what we see as a very interesting

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,480
and very

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
something with a high impact potential

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,000
for high impact is

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,279
the latest announcement by the european

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,320
commission of the their

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,440
2030 digital compass and specifically

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,320
the the target of having this 10 000

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
climate neutral

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,880
highly secure edge nodes deployed across

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,360
the continent by 2030 so that's that's a

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,399
lot of

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,399
metal and this is going to need a

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,759
commitment from

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,880
telecommunication operators a commitment

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,600
by investors and cloud providers to

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,279
expand

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,639
their infrastructure and offer new

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,079
infrastructure at the edge

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,880
in a seamless way in this we also think

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,720
we can help

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:38,240
and gaia x is going to help as well in

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,040
making this possible more accessible to

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
both providers and consumers of this

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,360
this technology

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,360
and also going towards that

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,480
objective to decrease europe's

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,720
dependency on

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,720
critical non-eu technologies

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,240
there are a number of initiatives now in

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,880
europe apart from the from gayax which

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
i'll

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
get into more detail in a second and

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,439
also the new

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
horizon europe calls there's also the

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,839
eep sign the

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,480
important price of common european

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,559
interest of

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
the cloud and infrastructure and

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,520
services

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,520
sector and these is a project that's

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,039
being led by germany and france and

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,959
involves a number of eu member states um

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,120
in which we're really happy to see that

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
there is an explicit commitment to

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,919
develop

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,520
european open source technologies and

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,200
and create and support the development

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
of technologies that can actually

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,120
manage workloads and combine

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,000
infrastructures across the whole

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,200
cloud edge continuum which for us is

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,400
kind of a natural

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,720
nexus step coming from the data center

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,640
reaching to the public cloud and then to

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,039
the edge and the iot

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
level

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
so um how is uh how we think idx is

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,679
going to do that how we are planning to

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,000
support this um well as you know kayaks

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,440
is

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
uh it's a european initiative a

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,559
pan-european initiative um

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,240
announced uh back in 2019 by the german

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,690
and french government

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,120
um um we joined the project in

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,799
[Music]

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:21,840
march 2020 um the community has been

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:24,480
has been increasing almost exponentially

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,520
since the the gaia x association was

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,280
created

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,039
in late 2020 we've seen a number of

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,200
corporate members and research

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
associations and providers joining the

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
project so we're really happy to see

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,480
that this is

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,600
gaining momentum now also it's getting

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,679
support from different new member states

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,799
and now it's becoming something that's

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,559
not just um

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,320
promoted by the german and french

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
governments but also it's

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,520
getting its own autonomy in that sense

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
and and its

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,760
own uh inertia in terms of um

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,000
of putting and defining new

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,600
uh new challenges and new objectives and

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,640
how the implementation of the whole

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,480
platform is going to

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,200
take place in the end so um

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,200
the gaiax project is based on this idea

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,640
that

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,080
europe needs to improve its

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,559
technological sovereignty

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,280
that the cloud is going to be a major

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,039
element for this and and guidex

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,559
is is is a tool that's going to allow

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,960
different um companies and and agents in

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,039
the

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,480
in the ecosystem to come together and

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,760
develop together

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,799
uh a solution and that's going to be

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,360
beneficial for

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,480
for different sectors we're talking here

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,880
about

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,600
combining infrastructure providers for

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,039
instance

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,559
with data and services

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,600
so breaking down the

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,240
de facto

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,600
stack that hyperscalers provide because

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
they provide their infrastructure they

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,440
provide

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,960
data they provide their own services

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,240
so breaking down that stack into

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,640
different elements and different

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,840
companies being able to provide these

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,600
resources separately and

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,360
for the user and for companies using

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,280
this service to be able

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,720
in a federated way to use this

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,960
infrastructure these services

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:26,480
and this data with a number of

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,559
resources and catalogs and following and

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,080
respecting a number of

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,520
roles and legal requirements so gdpr for

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,799
instance is an important one

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,919
but also things like identity trust

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,520
management

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,520
being able to access these resources in

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,200
a federated way not only from

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,720
centralized place and for companies and

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,000
providers to be able to offer these

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,720
resources in a flexible way

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,880
through their search description and

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,120
policies that are open to discussion and

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,159
open source when possible and open

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,640
standards as well

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,240
so it's a it's a really nice project and

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,640
we think it's uh

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,559
it's it's perfect for this at this stage

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
for for europe at least to

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,840
to start thinking about a common

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,960
position and how to collaborate

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,679
even between and among competitors how

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
to

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,039
uh collaborate to define a common

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,360
platform

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,360
that they can all benefit from

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,840
um we also think that gaiax

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,240
in that sense is going to help achieve

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,559
the

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,720
the european commission's objectives to

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,120
to have uh

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
europe's next generation at cloud as

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,960
something that can actually

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
support the uh the deployment of

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,640
infrastructure and

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,559
applications across as i mentioned the

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,600
this this continuum the cloud

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,720
edge continuum which for us also

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
involves

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,559
the the core data center as well as we

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,440
come from the private cloud we also

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,440
understand

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
organizations that want to leverage the

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,799
new edge computing

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
resources that are going to be available

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,039
they will also need to

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
manage the workloads and the

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,679
infrastructure that they keep on

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,799
premises

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,480
so what we see now is

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
coming back let's say from the public

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,720
cloud after several years

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,120
of uh heavy investment in marketing

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,880
by hyperscalers that everything could be

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,360
run on the cloud

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,799
now what we see is a movement in the

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
other in the other way

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,480
so companies realizing and governments

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,360
realizing that part of the

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,960
data and and technological sovereignty

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,039
also involves to retain

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,640
control of some of the infrastructure

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,840
that they need and the data that they

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,440
need and

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,559
have that data and those resources

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,039
on premises so physically located under

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,080
in their facilities and in this case

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,000
being able to deploy

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,679
a multi-cloud environment and use

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,400
resources from from providers

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,240
in different locations not just big data

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,600
centers but also smaller data centers

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,480
closer to the users and

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,559
customers but also things that didn't

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,159
act like

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,799
iot devices or what we call the firex so

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,320
infrastructure resources on board of of

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:15,039
trains and

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,039
and other transportation needs

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,760
from our perspective what we think is

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,039
that europe has

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,559
has many capabilities already in place

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,640
so there are a number of technologies

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,080
that can be crucial to do this

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,120
and part of our projects to integrate

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,679
nebula with gayax go

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,640
through that so that that process so

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,520
they will

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,600
be based on um leveraging and

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,960
integrating and improving our support

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,679
for other european open source

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,559
technologies

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,480
like those you see there and also using

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,520
the open source technology that gaiax

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,760
itself is going to

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,320
develop as part of the the gaiax

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,120
federated services that are really being

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,120
developed now

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
well if you want some more more

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,120
information on these specific approach

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,559
and how to use

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,840
um european open source for this and

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:14,880
what each of these vendors is doing uh

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,720
in terms of of adapting to

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,240
the edge revolution and just a quick

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,559
invitation here for you to

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,520
to watch this this webinar we had a few

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,720
weeks ago

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,120
with with limbit mariadb and

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,120
suse

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,200
so our specific integration um with

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,640
kayaks

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,880
is basically going to happen through the

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,559
um our provider catalog that already

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,080
mentioned so for us the model

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,799
is having an opennebula

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,880
instance that opens up a world of

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,000
possibilities for users in terms of

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,520
leveraging and providing

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
provisional resources from different

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,520
different providers that happens

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,480
through the catalog so one of the

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,960
objectives of gaiax is going to be

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
to put in place a federated catalog of

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,559
these of these resources so

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,200
for us the integration is almost

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:12,320
immediate once the apis are ready

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,080
so for our users to be able to to

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,000
provision the resources that we offer it

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,200
through the guyax

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,360
catalog integrate that into our catalog

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,679
and then for our users to as they would

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,679
do and any other provider just to deploy

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,600
the vms or application containers or

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,159
kubernetes classes on the infrastructure

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,320
that comes through the gaiax

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,760
portal the use cases we

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,679
we see there almost an immediate

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,159
application for for

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,120
a number of corporate users and sectors

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,200
to leverage

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,120
those those resources that are going to

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880
be offered by kaya x providers through

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,840
the kayaks federated and federation

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,679
services

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
especially the catalog but also things

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,200
like identity and trust and the

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,279
monitoring that you need to

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,720
to make sure that the resources deliver

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,320
what they promise

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,279
um so for users and customers that have

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,960
already enabled instance on premises as

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,559
they will do with any other

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,520
third party provider that will be able

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,720
to access those those guidex providers

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,320
and we also see new business cases here

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,960
like for some

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,279
providers to create sector

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,000
sector-specific

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,480
portals with uh with a subset of of

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,919
gaiax providers and guide services for

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
specific customers

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,039
with their own x applications to be

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,320
ready to be deployed

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,880
public or private marketplaces and

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,159
and this is also a model that we see we

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
think it has a lot of potential to

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,320
create these new business models based

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
on

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,200
on a specific subset of kayaks for

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
specific sectors

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,120
so again that's uh the main two use

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,720
cases that we're trying to

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,880
to implement as part of our integration

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,400
with kayaks expanding your enterprise

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
cloud based on

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,600
nebula to the edge using the

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
cloud and edge resources offered by

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,799
gaiax providers

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,919
for running vms on applications

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:17,120
and sort of gadgets

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,559
as a service using a specific a subset

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,279
of resources from

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,919
from diax through a hosted instance of

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,520
nebula

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,480
offered by by a new provider to include

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:30,240
a creative subset of resources and

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,840
access to private marketplaces to deploy

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,840
specific applications for specific

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
sectors

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,080
so um through geidericks i think it's um

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,679
it's going to be i mean it's going to

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,880
speed up

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,720
the implementation of europe's next

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,520
generation at cloud

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,840
we think uh and it all seems to indicate

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,159
that

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,120
uh it is going to be based on on open

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,440
source technologies

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,320
and we think that's that's a marvelous

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,000
idea

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,039
um i think we we all are hoping uh

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,440
that gaia x and other initiatives will

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,320
see

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,200
a strong our stronger commitment by the

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,399
by the

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,960
european industry which

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,120
is not always that familiar with what

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
open source means so

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,760
there is i think one of the challenges

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,080
is probably the change in the mindset of

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,039
many of the companies in europe were not

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,279
used to

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,880
collaborate with their competitors in

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,159
creating something and maintaining

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,399
something together

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
but we think gaia x through an open

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,120
source model can actually achieve that

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,840
it can be

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,880
a tool for for changing the mindsets of

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,240
the

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,279
the eu industry so

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,399
we're hoping to see a commitment from

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,039
from integrators and

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,480
research organizations obviously cloud

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,360
and edge providers in europe

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,279
hardware manufacturers as well 5g

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,960
providers is an important element there

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,159
and telecommunication companies

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
beyond those agreements they are they're

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,240
reaching

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,840
now with to with with hyperscalers

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,760
and obviously an important element here

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,480
is going to be public but also private

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,240
investment

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,480
in the new edge infrastructure that

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,399
europe needs

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
with all these elements i think we are

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,399
going to be able

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,600
thanks to the open source model we're

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,679
going to be able to build

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,440
a european cloud and its ecosystem a

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,559
strong one across

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,080
the continent and around the open open

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,679
platforms like

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,240
like gaiax we are

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,120
already we have been able to identify

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
use cases that

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,799
have a high impact and are going to be

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,080
key applications for

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,760
many sectors to mobilize europe's

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
very strong powerful research and

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,559
development and technological

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,600
capabilities and the innovation that's

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
taking place

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,760
and open up new businesses and new

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,320
spaces for collaboration for companies

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,159
in europe

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,760
so here you have more resources if you

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,840
want to look at the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,840
read more details about our approach

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,640
very welcome and

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,559
obviously you're very welcome to to to

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,559
have a look at open ebla try it

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,799
and let us know what you think about the

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,360
the new technology we are developing

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,320
and well i think that's been all from my

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,840
side

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,840
thank you all in advance for your

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,840
questions and and see you at the chat
