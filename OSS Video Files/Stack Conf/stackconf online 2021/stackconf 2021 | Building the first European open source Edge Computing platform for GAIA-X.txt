Edge Computing is becoming increasingly popular nowadays thanks to the growing availability of cloud, bare-metal and 5G providers offering flexible and affordable access to edge resources around the globe. The idea is based on moving core computational processes and storage to distant locations that are closer to the entities they interact with, like end-users and IoT devices. The benefits come from improving network latency and user experience, reducing security risks, and minimizing data transfers to central cloud locations. Thanks to the €2.1M awarded in 2019 by the European Commission as part of the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument Program, OpenNebula has developed the first open source Edge Computing platform in Europe. This talk analyses the benefits and challenges associated with Edge Computing, introduces the “True Hybrid Cloud” concept, and explores how this new EU-funded Edge Computing platform contributes to consolidate Europe’s digital sovereignty by integrating other relevant European open source technologies and by providing future access to the GAIA-X federated infrastructure.
