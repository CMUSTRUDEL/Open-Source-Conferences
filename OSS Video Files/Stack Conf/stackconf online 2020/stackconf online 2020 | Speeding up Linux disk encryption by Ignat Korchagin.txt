Description: 
	Encrypting data at rest is a must-have for any modern SaaS company. And if you run your software stack on Linux, LUKS/dm-crypt [1] is the usual go-to solution. However, as the storage becomes faster, the IO latency, introduced by dm-crypt becomes rather noticeable, especially on IO intensive workloads.

At first glance it may seem natural, because data encryption is considered an expensive operation. But most modern hardware (specifically x86 and arm64) platforms have hardware optimisations to make encryption fast and less CPU intensive. Nevertheless, even on such hardware transparent disk encryption performs quite poorly.
