They provide the workload isolation and security advantages of VMs. but at the same time maintain the speed of deployment and usability of containers.by using kata containers, instead of namespace, small virtual machines are created on the kernel and be strongly isolated. The technology of Kata Containers is based on KVM hypervisor. That’s why the level of isolation is equivalent to typical hypervisors. This session will focus on a live production phase when choosing kata instead of docker, and why they are preferable
Although containers provides software-level isolation of resources, the kernel needs to be shared. That’s why the isolation level in terms of security is not so high when compared with hypervisors.This learns to shift from Docker as the de facto standard to Kata containers and learn how to obtain higherl level of security
