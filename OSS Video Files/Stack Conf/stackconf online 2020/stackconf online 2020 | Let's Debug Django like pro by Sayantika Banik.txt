Title: stackconf online 2020 | Let's Debug Django like pro by Sayantika Banik

Description: 
	Writing clean code, with good logic is important.
But how about debugging the same like a pro and build pretty graphs?

“Debug like a pro just like you code”

Print statements though easy and powerful don’t help in understanding the behavioral aspects. In order to perform functionalities like visualizing the error/warning rates, we need an advanced debugging tool.
Through my talk, I aim to introduce debugging libraries like “logger”. Logger can be incorporated with Django with a couple of lines of code, which not only helps us understand the errors, but also the possible areas of improvement.
