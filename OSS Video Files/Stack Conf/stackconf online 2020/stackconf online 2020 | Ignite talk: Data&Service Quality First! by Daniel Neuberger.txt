Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	Fast like this ignite talk most of the Dev and OPs out there want to collect fast all information and events in one bulk. Better preparation before the ingest gives you less effort during the processing. Bee agog!

00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:19,610
data and service quality first my name

00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,770
is Daniel Noah Baga

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,110
I am working for networks where I am

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,210
helping customers to keep the

00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,450
information and event management systems

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,029
based on a Cray log or elastic stack up

00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:34,910
and running in their environments my

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:37,730
customers running a lot of different

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:41,120
stacks assemble together with multiple

00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,850
types of services and program pieces

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,179
which are producing a lot of logging or

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:49,280
working data and those techs are running

00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,309
services bound and produced by

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,399
developers deployed and maintained by

00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,589
operators all those tags are producing a

00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,010
lot of different data which is at the

00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:03,499
end used by another customer so we

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:06,920
identified three parties three needs

00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:09,409
three data types developers want debug

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,970
informations operators want the

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:14,570
informations about the infrastructure

00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,759
and the customers I ate one Stella lytx

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,149
from there dater so the challenges to

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,860
manage them all you should provide a

00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:24,020
high quality information and event

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:29,979
management system to track their data

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,979
but be aware fast collecting isn't on

00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:36,740
the successor is quality quality begins

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,350
with the creation of the services which

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,079
are producing the data so that means

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,619
right from the beginning the developer

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,659
makes the solid crown choosing the right

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:50,509
so on the level of beside data quality

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:53,710
means you should take care about using

00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,780
like standards like the FC 5 4 2 4 or

00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:59,390
using clean structures on your custom

00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,509
logging or a data format like chase no

00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:05,240
key value on the operator side service

00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,429
quality means defining and delivery

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,649
standard with a specified protocol and

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,710
format where all can ingest them and

00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:16,970
provide clear data processing based on

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:19,879
the data structure on the customer side

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,500
service usage quality means defining

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,130
clean means for the requested

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:29,180
information to help you operators to

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,960
whew well and you shouldn't mess up the

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,030
system mastering data and service

00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,450
quality means not only choosing the

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,200
right tools also means to have a deeper

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:45,490
inspect into your data and to understand

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,140
your data before you and when you are

00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,450
establishing tools as developer you

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,230
should respect the guidelines you should

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:56,870
talk with your operators and you should

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,210
not invent a new wheel and then you will

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,390
find the right lock and data format for

00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,980
you as an operator obtaining the

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,650
knowledge about the data structure first

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,390
is all interview developer colleagues

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,070
then you are able to choose to write

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,830
useful information in event management

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:14,690
system and to provide standardized tools

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,580
for information and event interest and

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,260
that will increase the service quality

00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:24,080
so that your customer can clarify what

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,950
he needs and he can use clearly what he

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,850
needs and he also can better respect the

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,980
restrictions of the services the result

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,920
will be with those insights you can

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,210
choose to write tools at the end so that

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:42,440
means get familiar with your data and

00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,250
obtaining knowledge about your data

00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,410
structure will help you to get more

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,900
comfort of course the right tools are

00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:55,790
also increasing your quality and comfort

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:58,280
of a longer time range when you are

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:03,200
working with the data researching and

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,630
analyzing it which tool to use depends

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,080
on the source of the data the format of

00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:14,600
the inch asset data and the requirements

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:17,150
of analyzes for logging and all other

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,070
different kinds of data that in my

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,520
humble opinion is a way to increase

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,180
their in service quality all three

00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:29,930
parties at the end and to establish

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,870
satisfaction in the usage so thank you

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,820
for listening to me and I hope you will

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,820
give data quality a shot

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:58,850
