Title: stackconf online 2020 |Leveraging Procedural Knowledge: From Riding a Bike to Bare Metal Automation
Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	...by Rain Leander

On the road to senior engineer, one has to inhale multiple technologies. This often seems like a series of massive obstacles wherein each new technology resembles a new beginning. However, engineers often underestimate the extent to which procedural knowledge from one technology transfers to a new technology. In this talk, I will demonstrate that the process from OpenStack Community Liaison to Tinkerbell Developer Advocate was a series of procedural knowledge transfers, wherein the obstacles to learning reduces with each new technology that is learned. I will provide specific examples, from getting started to troubleshooting issues, and conclude with practical recommendations on how to create a coherent plan for transitioning from one technology to another.

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,759
hello

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
and welcome to leveraging procedural

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,439
knowledge from riding a bike to

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,920
bare metal automation um first real

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,880
quick

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,240
i would love to hear who here knows what

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,840
procedural knowledge is

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,880
just raise your hand i'm just kidding

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,200
sorry we can't be

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,239
as interactive but i am available online

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,360
to take questions

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,120
while this is talk is playing

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,879
today we're going to learn about

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
procedural knowledge as well as

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,760
declarative knowledge

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,960
we're going to learn about learning

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,600
really quick

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
and then we're also going to learn about

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,399
approaching a new technology

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,480
or and that can be a language it can be

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,360
bare metal automation it can be riding a

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,719
bike

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,000
it can be anything where you are

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,320
playing with something you are

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,920
completely unfamiliar with

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,560
as long as you have gotten sticky before

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,760
with

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
something new you can do it again it's

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,560
just

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,600
a matter of codifying and defining that

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,119
process

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,320
here we go so first of all i am not a

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,320
teacher

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
i have not been on zoom these past few

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,200
weeks with hundreds of students

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,720
and therefore you would think i am

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,320
completely unqualified

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,119
but i am a lifelong learner i've been

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,759
curious my whole life if i find

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,360
something new i want to take it apart

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,079
put it back together figure out how it

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,439
works often with parts left over

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,960
but hopefully it works again and i

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
and i hope that you're a lifelong

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
learner too i also happen to be

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,799
a community manager at packet where i

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,079
started

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,200
just two and a half weeks ago

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,759
and i thought well i'm gonna have to

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
ingest

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,600
all this new information why don't i

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,680
write down my process

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
and share it with other people and maybe

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
it'll help now

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
fun fact i used to be a professional

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,599
dancer

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,440
so if i dance a little bit during this

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,879
sorry not sorry but hopefully

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
i will help you today to learn about

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,599
ingesting new technologies

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,239
and maybe inspire you to dance a bit

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,640
with your knowledge

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,280
so who are you maybe your students and

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,519
that would be

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:40,000
awesome but definitely you're curious

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,920
you might be someone who is asked to

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,920
explore new technology

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
or ask to solve a problem where you're

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,840
going to have to explore

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,040
several new technologies this can be

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,239
programming languages

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,239
it can be infrastructure it can be

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,840
any time when you're asked to explore

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
but it can also be that you're

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,440
independently wanting to

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,879
figure out open broadcasting software or

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,000
any other new thing

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,280
this is this is for you now

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,400
also fun fact if you know everything

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,879
this is not your talk and

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,319
that's okay because there will be tons

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
of other talks that are great

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,840
so getting back to that question what is

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,400
procedural knowledge

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
it's best to look on procedural

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
knowledge

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,720
versus declarative knowledge declarative

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
knowledge

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,319
is j is the tenth letter of the

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,200
romanized alphabet

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,239
uh amsterdam is the capital of the

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
netherlands

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,920
these are facts that's declarative

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,400
knowledge

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
procedural knowledge is how you ride

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
your bike

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,120
and the thing is that you may have

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,400
ridden your bike so much

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,640
that you can do it without thinking

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
there's a procedure to it that you used

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
to have to think about you used to have

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,040
to think about

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,120
balance and motion and pedals and brakes

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,400
and all that stuff and in that case when

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
you were first learning it was

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,239
declarative knowledge but it became

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,079
procedural knowledge over time

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,000
effectively what we're doing we

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
have worked with certain technologies

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
for years and years and years

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,160
with certain projects for years and

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,759
years with certain languages

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,840
and we want to take that curiousness

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
that we first had when we were first

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,840
inhaling

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,440
that language or technology and we want

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,360
to apply it to future technologies

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,000
i've created a process but first i want

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,880
to make sure we're on the same page

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,080
make sure that we know how to learn

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,320
which can be

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,919
a struggle and as i said i'm not a

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,479
teacher so i'm not going to i'm

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,680
qualifier qualifier qualifier

00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,360
this is not necessarily going to

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,520
apply to every uh learning

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
challenge and whatnot but these are the

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,840
four

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,720
general parts to make learning more

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,600
efficient

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,520
this talk is divided into two sections

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
we're going to learn to learn

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,800
and we're going to trust the process the

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
process

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,919
is something that i

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,520
have developed and i would love your

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,160
input maybe not

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,680
right this second during the talk but i

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
would love your input

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
as to whether or not it resonates with

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,600
you

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,479
whether or not you no no it won't work

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
because

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,120
i don't like to read or or whatnot i

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
want to hear that so please reach out to

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,199
me

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,880
on chat right now during statconf or

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,320
on twitter at rainleander

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,039
first though i want to very quickly

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,199
go over learning to learn this is based

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,319
on

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,960
that ability to pursue and persist in

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,440
learning to organize your own learning

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
through effective time management and

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
information

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,840
both individually and in groups so

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,639
collaboratively

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,639
and on your own and this is an important

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,600
skill that you need to have

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,639
especially in the technology industry

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
especially

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
as things keep changing and we need to

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,479
keep adapting

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,479
with it

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,880
learning to learn is based on a book

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
called the mind for numbers by

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,639
barbara oakley i highly recommend it

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,840
this woman

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,120
thought that she could not learn uh

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,080
science and math she effectively

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,759
did very poorly in school and then ended

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,800
up getting a phd later

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:51,520
when she figured out how to

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,840
codify and make her brain more efficient

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,720
it effectively comes down to four parts

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,720
focus and diffuse thinking

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
which we'll go to in a sec taking a

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,720
break

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,919
is it is it time for a break rate no

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
okay

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,919
practicing so that information

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,039
goes from being declarative to

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,280
procedural

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,400
and then you you need to know yourself

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,840
you need to know

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,599
whether or not you can you can study for

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,479
longer periods or if you need shorter

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:26,080
periods with longer breaks etc etc

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:31,199
and that i can't help you with that

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,240
but we can talk about it call me

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,680
okay first focus versus diffuse thinking

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,680
okay so focus

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,440
focus is is that moment cognitive

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,680
scientists

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,520
call task oriented it's when you are

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,240
very much studying what not um

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,319
it's it's that moment of ingesting the

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,360
actual information

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,240
and then diffuse thinking is when

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,720
your brain isn't really thinking about

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,400
anything in particular

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,360
but in the background it's connecting

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
different ideas in ways that you

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,520
wouldn't

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,039
consciously put together it's important

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,080
to have

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,120
a handle a conscious handle over how you

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,840
do

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,440
enter diffuse thinking versus focus

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,240
thinking

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
because that's how information actually

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,759
sinks in

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
you can be in focus thinking and read

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,399
the same paragraph

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,360
over and over and over again and it

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
doesn't stick

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,399
raise your hand if you've if you can

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,839
yeah you know what i'm saying

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,480
but until you go to diffuse thinking

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,279
that information doesn't sink down it

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,200
doesn't

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,640
then make parallels to other things that

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,160
you've already known

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,760
it doesn't stick

00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,880
uh thomas edison once he would

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,880
sit with ball bearings in his hand and

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,000
he would kind of daydream kind of relax

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,959
and he would kind of let his mind

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,800
wander and as he fell asleep he would

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,560
drop the ball bearings

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,040
and that would wake him up and then he

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,560
would take he would immediately jump

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,399
back into focus thinking so that he

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,360
could take those

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
different connections and whatnot that

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,720
he had made

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,279
in diffuse thinking and put them into

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
production

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,160
so that said we've we've got focus

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,360
versus diffuse thinking

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,640
now take a break okay

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,399
nobody seriously wait

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,000
go ahead and you know pomodoro

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
thinking where it's it's kind of a

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
tomato timer

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,800
you set it for 25 minutes when the timer

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,600
goes off then you take a break so for 25

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,640
minutes this

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,839
is the the simplest mode

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,240
of take a break so for 25 minutes you

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
would be in focus thinking

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
and then for 5 or 10 minutes you would

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,880
take a break

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,839
take a walk meditate something where you

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,800
are

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,680
relaxed and thinking in a different way

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,240
no longer focused on that subject

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,720
but letting your brain wander and this

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,880
is so

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
vital because of the focus versus

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,920
diffuse thinking

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,200
if you are just banging your head

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,480
against the wall

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,120
until something makes sense sometimes it

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
works

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:43,120
i mean zombies do it so

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,480
yay but for the rest of us mere mortals

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,200
we have to think about focus versus

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,440
diffuse

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,240
and therefore take a break you may find

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,120
as an individual that you can focus for

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
50 minutes

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,279
and take a 10 minute break or that you

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,760
can only focus for 10 minutes

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,079
and take a two minute break that's up to

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,360
you you have to experiment with this

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:10,959
pomodoro is highly recommended

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,600
so does barbara oakley but you find what

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,600
works for you

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
and then it comes down to practice so

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,640
think of

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:24,240
practice like ingesting

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,240
uh small sections at a time to make up a

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,160
large picture

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,480
the very first time you do an

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,519
installation of an entire

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,040
cloud infrastructure for example you may

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
only get to where you're really

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
comfortable with installing the

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,200
operating system

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,320
and i realized i don't know everyone's

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,120
experience but when you're installing an

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,920
entire cloud infrastructure you start

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
with the operating system

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,920
if you're installing everything actually

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,720
technically you would be starting with

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,079
the hardware

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
so i guess you would be ordering the

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
hardware but that's clicky clicky i'm

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
talking about

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,040
once you've got the hardware you do the

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,800
os installation

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,399
and that might not be procedural yet

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,040
you might actually have to do the

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,800
default and then actually read the

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
manual and make sure it's set up

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,399
correctly for when your cloud goes on

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
top

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,680
after that then you once you've got the

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,920
operating system then you've

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,000
learned that section it becomes

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,399
procedural knowledge and you can layer

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,880
more knowledge on top of that

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:36,000
but it takes time repetition sometimes

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,200
break it down into smaller tasks and as

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,399
you

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,880
as you conquer those smaller tasks

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,440
they slowly become procedural until

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,639
you've got

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,160
entire sections of knowledge that you

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,160
don't need to think about anymore

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,320
any questions go ahead and ask me on

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,519
chat

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,079
and i'm happy to answer you and then

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,839
finally

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,240
know thyself yes i can say all this

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,240
stuff

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,240
but maybe it doesn't resonate for you

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
maybe you have to experiment on your own

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,519
before it works

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,600
maybe you find that you have to have

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,040
music playing or you have to be in a

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
collaborative setting

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,720
not by yourself or that you have to be

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
outside

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,120
different things work better for

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,600
different people and that all depends on

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
you

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,959
it's all individual i would love to hear

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,120
how it works for you or if it doesn't

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,519
work for you i'm happy to talk about it

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,800
reach out to me and chat

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,480
okay so that's learning to learn

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
now we're going to talk about the actual

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,600
process of ingesting

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
new information this can be used for

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,160
technology yes

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
this is a technology talk and i'm going

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
to talk about

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,560
two particular infrastructure projects

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,639
that i've

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,760
worked on in the past and then one that

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,279
i'm learning

00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,800
right now

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,040
that is openstack and packet

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,199
now openstack is a cloud technology it's

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,760
a open infrastructure

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,040
technology system i highly recommend it

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,279
if

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,440
you are it's a really big project

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,800
and it's uh it's a great way to learn

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,600
about

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,440
cloud and ci and and there's a lot of

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
it's an umbrella project it's huge

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,839
highly recommend it had a lot of fun

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,480
still having fun with it

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
and now i'm at packet and at packet host

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,399
you can

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,360
effectively take pieces of bare metal

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,560
you can rent

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,480
actual bare metal systems

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,240
and put whatever operating system you

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,360
want on top of it

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,440
and therefore put your app or use it in

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,519
any kind of

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,480
use cases that you could think of that

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,959
you would need bare metal for

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,839
let's talk about the process of

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,440
ingesting new information

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,720
within an infrastructure

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,839
versus bare metal automation

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,040
uh kelsey hightower

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,079
he was a guest two years ago

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,839
on the community pulse podcast uh the

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,880
particular episode was about

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,680
impostor syndrome and if you have

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,720
ever heard kelsey hightower or know who

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,440
he is

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,519
you know that he is a kubernetes guru

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
he's a developer advocate he's pretty

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,600
awesome

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,680
and it was it was great to hear in his

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,279
own words his opinions about imposter

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,560
syndrome as well as the hosts of the

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,600
show

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,279
at one point he specifically said

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,440
if you've been doing this for a while no

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,279
matter what the technology is you

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,160
download it you install it

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,360
use the default config maybe it works

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,079
maybe it doesn't

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
fix and repeat that's the industry and

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,639
that's

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,680
that's all it is but

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,079
i've narrowed it down to three specific

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,279
parts within ingesting that new

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,079
technology

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,320
that you might follow through if you

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,519
want more of a deeper dive more of a

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,120
sampling

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
sometimes you just need to see if it

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,040
works or not that's when you would do

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
what kelsey says

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,639
download install default config bam does

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,000
it work or not

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,399
move on but if you're needing

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,519
to get to know a little bit more about

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,079
that technology

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,480
you might think about communication

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
documentation and the actual

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,360
installation

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,680
this could also be building the project

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,120
do the thing could be whatever the

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,720
actual

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,360
uh thing

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,440
that's the uh technical term for it

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
whatever the actual thing is you gotta

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,000
actually

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,600
do something with it whether it is

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,279
build a little app or migrate

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,319
an app or build an installation

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,439
rip it down test it the actual playing

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,039
with the thing

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,839
that is the most important step for me

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,439
that's when the knowledge sinks in but

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,600
you need to have communication and

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
documentation to back that up

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,919
for that information if it breaks i need

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,959
to know how to ask

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:27,199
if there's a manual i need to read it

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,160
so let's talk about communication from a

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,160
broader scale

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,720
communication is how you get feedback

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,840
to how do you um dynamically chat

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,600
with maintainers and other users

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:49,840
how do you um is there a forum

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,840
how do you get support um

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:56,799
this could be any kind of

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,120
knowledge sharing uh as opposed to

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
documentation which tends to be just one

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
way

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:09,200
so it's any time there can be a

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,200
back and forth between two entities

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
for example with openstack you have

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,360
mailing lists

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,679
which are available at

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,600
lists.openstack.org

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,679
there are forums for ask.openstack.org

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,400
dynamic chat is handled on irc there are

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:31,760
tons of channels but most of them are on

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,880
openstack uh uh sorry

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,320
on freenode openstack

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,160
um you would file bugs on either

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,480
launchpad or storyboard and there are

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,559
many mentorship programs and getting

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,679
started programs specifically to help

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
someone

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:53,200
um when they're first coming to the

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,200
openstack project

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,600
and then with packet most

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,880
of these communications are done

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,120
on slack so all of your mailing list

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,600
forums in dynamic chat is handled on

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,520
packetcommunity.slack.com

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,880
if you go to slack.packet.com you can

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,280
sign up for

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,919
a invitation and then you can use

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,880
slack to do all of your dynamic

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,000
flowering bugs

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,880
all of it sorry not filing bugs

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,280
asking questions and what you would

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,760
normally use a mailing list for

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,960
and then just recently we started

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,280
accepting

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,280
bugs from the community via github

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,320
there is while there is a mentorship

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,240
program it is

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:48,000
very relaxed

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,720
and if you are looking to get started

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
definitely go to the slack channel and

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,600
we'll help you out there

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,520
um i am rayne leander on

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,200
the slack channel and i would love to

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,000
help you out but we have lots of people

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,159
on there

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,559
ready to help so then documentation is

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,240
not

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:10,080
just white pages or

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
technical documents this is your getting

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,200
started guide this is just blogs this is

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,320
even videos

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,039
this is technically a documentation

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
a form of documentation because it's a

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,960
resource

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:26,080
and unless you're there for the chat

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,080
during slack conf

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,159
there's no way for me to actually

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,799
interact with you

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,799
so it's a form of documentation and

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,400
these are all resources to help you get

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,840
going within technology

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,840
that are really important

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,000
so within pocket

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,640
actually the slide is wrong

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,840
within openstack um

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,240
to get started it's openstack.org

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,559
software start the docs are under

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,679
docs.openstack.org

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,360
and the blog is openstack.org blog i

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,120
would also highly recommend

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,919
checking out super user that is another

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,960
blog for openstack and it has a lot of

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,039
use cases

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:20,240
and uh individual process on it

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,880
um it's very google it's very easy to

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
google

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,919
openstack things you can either do site

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,280
openstack

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,760
site colon openstack.org

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,320
and then whatever you want to ask or

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,760
because

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:38,000
openstack is such a distinct word

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,000
you can do openstack and whatever word

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,880
within packets however um googling is

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,240
not as easy

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,679
um but first uh getting started

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,960
is under packet.com developers the docs

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,240
are under resources

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,440
and there is a blog all three of these

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,240
have use cases um and

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,919
while it's a little bit chaotic this is

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,000
something that the developer relations

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
team is working on to organize and make

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
it a little bit

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,280
easier to get going if you have any

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,440
feedback you want to give us

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,799
about our documentation please reach out

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,919
to me on twitter

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,080
or join the slack channel now

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,120
i specifically put the google is not as

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,440
easy for packet because packets

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,320
is a very generic term that could refer

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,080
to

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,880
several other technologies and aspects

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,000
of

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,880
the internet so what i recommend if you

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
google

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,320
if you need to google something about

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,039
packet

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,760
specifically definitely use the

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:46,159
sitecolonpacket.comspace

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,919
whatever question you have or come onto

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,919
the slack channel and ask us there

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,280
okay and then for the fun part at least

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,880
for me

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,600
i love doing the thing it comes down to

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
working with my hands i'm kind of a

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,520
kinesthetic

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,360
learner myself by the way those learning

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,200
styles those are

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,200
not exactly

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,280
scientifically proven as a matter of

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,600
fact opposite if someone has always told

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,120
you

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,120
that you're a kinesthetic learner

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,159
therefore you must do

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,600
not necessarily true um

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,080
don't worry if you don't fit into a

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,559
learning style is my point

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,880
but for me i love to do the thing i love

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,760
to do the installation and see the codes

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,880
scroll by

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,240
and an actual successful ping

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,280
is the best and what not

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,640
let's talk about openstack and packet so

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,000
on openstack

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,520
the installation is docs.openstack.org

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,120
install guide you can use

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,159
either suse for now

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,240
rel or centos or ubuntu for your

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,200
operating system you can actually

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,039
or you used to be able to select out

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,600
your operating system it would give you

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,760
install guides based on your operating

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,120
system which is pretty cool

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:11,200
um and then with packet there are

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,960
install guides all throughout the

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,279
website like i said we're working on

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,400
this one so it's a little bit clearer

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,039
but you can find use case installations

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,159
everywhere the cool thing about packet

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,440
is you can use

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,279
literally any operating system just the

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,080
other day someone came onto our forum

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,200
and they were like

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,320
but can i install on zen and we were

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,840
like yep

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,840
that's when you use ipixie

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,720
it's pretty cool if i do say so myself

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,919
so effectively leveraging procedural

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,400
knowledge this talk

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,720
is in two parts it's about learning to

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,840
learn which is focus versus diffuse

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,520
thinking

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,159
taking a break i'm just kidding

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,200
it still works practicing knowing

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,039
yourself

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,400
and then trusting the process which is

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,120
communication

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,880
documentation and doing the thing

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,960
thank you and if you have any questions

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,279
please join me on slack or reach out to

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,880
me

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,480
at rainleander on pretty much

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,760
all of the socials and check out our

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,960
github repo

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:29,840
which is github.com packet host

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:29,840
thank you very much and have a good day

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:43,039
