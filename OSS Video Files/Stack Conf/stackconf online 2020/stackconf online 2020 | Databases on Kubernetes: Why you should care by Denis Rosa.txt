Title: stackconf online 2020 | Databases on Kubernetes: Why you should care by Denis Rosa
Publication date: 2020-06-29
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	Developers always expected databases to work out-of-the-box, but historically it is the exact opposite.

With the rise of Kubernetes StatefullSets and CRDs, we started thinking about running databases on it. But why should I do that in the first place? How hard is it? Which are the challenges? Is it production already? All those questions will be answered during a live demo where we will deploy a database, deploy an operator, fail nodes, scale up and down with nearly no manual intervention.
