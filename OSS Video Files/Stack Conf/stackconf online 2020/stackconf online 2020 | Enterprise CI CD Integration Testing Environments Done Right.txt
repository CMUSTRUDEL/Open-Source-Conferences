	...by Jan-Hendrik Peters

This talk will dive into automatically building fresh, enterprise-ready testing environments with AutomatedLab to better support integration testing in your build and release process. We will explore how AutomatedLab can help Dev and Ops people easily build their own highly-customizable, idempotent lab environment that is able to fully resemble their existing infrastructure.
After this session you will be able to test better and with more confidence.
