	# Testing at scale

Genuine CI/CD can’t be accomplished without continous testing. At organizations like Walmart, where about 50k deployments happen every day, we need a robust and scalable test infrastructure to execute these tests.

## Concord
We use Concord (http://concord.walmartlabs.com/) for deployments.It is an orchestration engine that connects different systems together using scenarios and plugins.

## Testing challenges
The teams at Walmart excel at automated testing and with about 1M of CI jobs running 24X7 (many of them run end-to-end tests for an hour or two), we’re at risk of hoarding the resources on our CI/CD servers. We needed a flexible and scalable solution which can meet the needs of the teams who run long end-to-end tests.

## Solution
We created a Concord plugin which will allow the users to leverage the Kubernetes infrastructure to run their end-to-end tests. Users can submit their Docker image for tests to Concord. It spins up a container called `Orchestra` which in turn spins up the jobs and suspends the Concord process. Once the jobs complete, it resumes the Concord process and users can continue with their flow.

## Advantages
1) Reliable and clean environment for testing
2) Scalable testing infrastructure with Kubernetes
3) Immutable and repeatable testing
