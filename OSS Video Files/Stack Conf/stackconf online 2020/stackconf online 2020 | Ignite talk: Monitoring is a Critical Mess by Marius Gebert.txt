Title: stackconf online 2020 | Ignite talk: Monitoring is a Critical Mess by Marius Gebert
Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	Everyone has an opinion about monitoring. But let’s be honest, whether consciously or not, we all know our monitoring is out of control. In this talk we’ll discuss how crazy monitoring can get while we struggle to stay sane. In 20 slides I will show you all the things that will drive you crazy one day or another – if not already.

00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,310
hello everyone my name is Marius I work

00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,990
for the net waste Web Services team and

00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,560
I'm responsible for the software service

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,880
part of this platform in my opinion

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,950
monitoring is like backup nobody wants

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,230
it until they needed and I think

00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:30,080
monitoring is a critical mess let's

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,520
start with the network of course you

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
want to a monitor a network right you

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,400
want to know what's going on you want to

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,860
know if your network is reachable you

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,450
know secure and you want to know who's

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,850
inside your network and where is the

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:43,130
traffic going so you ain't gonna monitor

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,350
it but how are you gonna monitor it um

00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:47,930
you could use a singer - or some other

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,970
tools like Negi us or the kimmells net

00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,530
key if you want something special and of

00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,510
course you want some graphs if you have

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,160
all the data right so there are not

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,160
electrons like refining profound on what

00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,170
you need to do so and the next one would

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,080
be the hardware of course you are

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,790
running your software on service and is

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,500
this hard way so you want to monitor all

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:11,750
the hardware that it's like different

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,780
parts you have to monitor the first part

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,850
would be the storage part you have

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,979
different tools here like collecti or

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,829
the object tools we need prometheus for

00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:24,469
it you can do a whole space monitoring

00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:26,600
with icing or with for the live data

00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:29,090
with Prometheus again or with graphing

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,130
graphing and then that thing nobody

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,020
wants to take care of the backup how do

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,569
you monitor all the backup do you do

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,479
some articles against the servers where

00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:41,270
the backup is rather running or do you

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,939
do some magic tricks in fact I really

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,710
don't know because the backup solutions

00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:51,049
I know are not that good in being a

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:55,249
software which is good to be monitored

00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:56,869
so the best thing to test the backup is

00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,240
a disaster you won't see if it works or

00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:01,249
not and imagine this there are

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,649
applications your own call it's sunny

00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:06,350
outside you lie outside no calls no

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:08,869
alerts it's cool right but what if there

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,369
aren't alerts because the alerts aren't

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:15,260
working because the monitoring system

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:18,019
isn't working so you need alerts in a

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,290
different way maybe not as an HS SMS

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:22,790
because your gateway couldn't work not

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,310
just email because you might so it could

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,500
be

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,659
but also maybe mobile notifications

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,150
because they're just working within it

00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:32,330
with rocket jet push over slack and then

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,590
there are containers nowadays nowadays

00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,420
software is not just a lamb steak on

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,519
hardware but it's darker and darker on

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,709
kubernetes with some random stuff

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,030
wrapped around which nobody understands

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:45,629
but you have to think about the

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,140
monitoring as well so you could use you

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,239
Prometheus again or you just could make

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,260
it even more worse and do your own

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:57,569
scripts which are ready to be I don't

00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,400
know connected from the money train not

00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,340
something like this and when it comes to

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,069
money you have to do accounting and you

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,900
have to monitor the the hardware and the

00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,500
resources you gave to customers and make

00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,470
reports and gave them to fna and many

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,769
more so you have to use a lot of tools

00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,870
here like team acct

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,090
and then graph a knife or some graphs or

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,940
if you have some metrics you have to use

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,370
gnocchi or Prometheus again or a

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,989
chespirito generates a report and if you

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,660
have another teletype openable you have

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:32,489
something different again and all of

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,160
this is just internal so sometimes you

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:36,870
have to give informations to your

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,450
customers or your colleagues which are

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,389
at home and don't reach the internal

00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,919
network of your setup so you have to do

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,169
something external and there you have a

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,669
sales page again there are different

00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:50,340
tools you have to take care of like

00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:54,060
caching status IO or I don't know how

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,599
they are are named but it's something

00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,209
you have to take care of as well to be

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,859
good and having informations external

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:04,230
and then there's the morning total

00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:07,919
monitoring this is like a dental spiral

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,410
because you don't have to monitor your

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,910
setup but also you have to monitor your

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,919
monitoring because as I said with the

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:17,370
notifications if the note if the

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,349
monitoring isn't running you can get

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,760
alerts so you have to do as well the

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:23,729
hardware monitoring the software

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,380
monitoring you have to look to see if

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,270
the conflict management is working fine

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,300
is the network ok that your colleagues

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,550
do well and in the end you will stand in

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,909
front of a wall with solutions with

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,350
problems with software and just mind

00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,680
blow

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,530
because it's so huge and if you go

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,770
deeper it's getting bigger and bigger so

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,750
if you have if you need help with your

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,730
setup your monitoring on something else

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,770
you can get in touch with us we have a

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,410
