Opensource software is becoming a pillar in our everyday life, leveraged by our cell phones, our transportation systems and on the websites we visit. In this quick talk, we will have a look on how Canada’s Advanced Research Computing (“ARC”) organizations use opensource software to deploy and operate some of the largest Supercomputers and Cloud deployments on Earth. We will briefly introduce the systems and dig deeper into the opensource technologies that together make the magic happen !
