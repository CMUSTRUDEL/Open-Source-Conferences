Description: 
	High level of customer satisfaction is a business goal for every brand and a key to success.And, you know what? This actually makes me extremely happy and excited. I love the fact that companies are taking efforts to make their customers happy in addition to thinking about the product and services offered. Businesses now know the importance of maintaining a good relationship with customers.While it is relatively easy to say, it is much more difficult to maintain and actually keep your customers happy and satisfied with the services or products you provide.

name is Monica Khanna and I'm really

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,830

customer retention how to convert users

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:35,540
to happy customers businesses that focus

00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,910
on retaining customers and building

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,260
loyalty are the ones that will survive

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:45,680
and thrive in this uncertain climate the

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,570
agenda for my talk is we'll start with

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,640
customer lifecycle that what are the

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,620
stages of the customer lifecycle what

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,989
are the benefits of customer retention

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,230
why do you think you need customer

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,609
retention and while you need them back

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,620
and then the wheels of the customer

00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,589
retention they are the ways which I am

00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,900
proposing that will by using these

00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:10,420
wheels you can retain your customer and

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,420
they can stick around you for lifelong

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,320
happiness customer happiness is the

00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,810
paramount factor which companies look

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,820
for their success so who's a happy

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:26,540
customer according to the standard

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,910
definition happiness means it's someone

00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:32,230
that had a great experience on your site

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:35,390
and wishes to repeat the experience

00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:38,540
samshield customer success manager a

00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:44,630
client success defines customer health

00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:47,750
as the customer current state of his

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,270
satisfaction after a given engagement

00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:54,350
and that again is engagement could be

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:57,590
through emails meetings phone calls any

00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:01,880
website page so are my customers happy

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:05,120
or are they not pretty simple if they

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,190
are not satisfied a game plan is created

00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,640
to improve their health and overall

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,610
success a happy customer can be a great

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,769
asset to any business as a happy

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,769
customer means happy business

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,069
according to Walt Disney he says do what

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,859
you do so

00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:29,469
well they will want to see it again and

00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,870
bring their friends and I really love

00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,569
this coat because that gives a sense

00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,730
that you should do everything from your

00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,280
sides so that you can see them again

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,989
and not only them but they can bring

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,439
more friends and you can get the

00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,439
reference

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,680
so the lifecycle of the customer starts

00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:53,680
with that first you start identifying

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,659
your customers understand your customers

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,219
that who are they what is your target

00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:02,379
audience who are you building for LN

00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:05,560
you need to satisfy your customers and

00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:10,930
then you retain your customers so what

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:14,260
do you do in identification phase create

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:17,349
and understand your customer personas

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,810
what are they looking for how do they

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:22,569
get influence and further the influenced

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,480
others what value do they want to get

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,549
from your solution do they have any

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,310
history with your solution or your

00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:33,549
competitive solutions are they doing it

00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,590
from somewhere else else as well so

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,269
putting your users in the absolute

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,569
center of your brand

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:44,889
pays off in kind then you need to

00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:47,799
satisfy your customers Michael libo said

00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:51,729
that a satisfied customer is the best

00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,009
business strategy of all family getting

00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:57,519
with customers in a way that resonates

00:03:54,009 --> 00:04:00,639
with them specifically with help you on

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,459
their respect throughout the customer

00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,400
journey and take effective measures to

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:10,329
build a lasting relationship with your

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,969
customers and then getting customers is

00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:15,759
great for any business but the real key

00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:18,400
to success lies when you need to retain

00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,519
them so customer retention is among the

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,750
most important metrics that can make or

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,750
break any business as the business grows

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:32,080
it becomes increasingly difficult to

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,330
keep tabs on the needs of your customers

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,159
especially when your customers can no

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,919
longer fit in one category

00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:43,669
so that's where the segmentation comes

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,399
in picture and you should categorize and

00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:50,199
segment the customers in chunks of

00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:53,479
groups if you have a system in place

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,779
where customers are segregated in

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:59,449
segments well you will be spending time

00:04:56,779 --> 00:05:03,019
more effectively because you will be

00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:07,009
better aligned to your customers needs

00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:10,429
goals and each customer's success

00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:13,309
criteria the way you segment your

00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:16,580
customers will depend on your specific

00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:19,249
business and of course on the people you

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,949
serve for which are considered in your

00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:25,279
customer base but some of the common

00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:28,029
customer segmentation models can start

00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,869
from customer profile that is

00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:35,329
demographic segmentation their lifestyle

00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:38,329
customer company or customer home the

00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:40,459
geographic location and the behavioral

00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:43,669
segmentation that is customer

00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:49,369
characteristics their journey and how

00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:52,189
they are doing it so what is retention

00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:55,579
customer retention refers to the ability

00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:58,159
of a customer and a company or a product

00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:00,999
to retain its customers over some

00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:05,899
specified period

00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:09,199
retention means this that the activities

00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:11,179
that companies or products do to retain

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,399
their customers high customer retention

00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:16,610
means customer of the product or

00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:19,429
business tend to return to continue to

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,119
buy or in some way not defect to another

00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:26,659
product or business or to non-use

00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:29,179
entirely so customer retention is also

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,579
about being proactive in the

00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:34,189
relationship about contacting customers

00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,409
skillfully in marketing campaigns to

00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:39,769
develop the relationship and encourage

00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:42,499
them to buy from you rather than pushing

00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:44,749
product at them it's about defending

00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:48,819
your customers from competitive

00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:50,629
activities customer retention is about

00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:53,270
simple things

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,719
it's about being easy to do business

00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:03,319
with putting things right when they go

00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:06,860
wrong so what are the benefits of

00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:09,999
customer retention of course it starts

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,619
with if you retain your customers

00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:18,439
increasing customer retention rates but

00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:21,919
5% increase the profits by 25% to 95

00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:25,459
percent a 2 percent increase in customer

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:29,389
retention has the same effect in

00:07:25,459 --> 00:07:32,719
decreasing cost by 10% and it's worth

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:36,499
10x as much on average the loyal

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:42,860
customers are worth up to 10 times much

00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:46,699
as their first purchase who will not

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,969
want to be an exemplary lovable Vlad so

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:52,759
Master your customer service create

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:57,019
great experience and do whatever it

00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:01,339
takes or it keeps your customers around

00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:04,580
you if you want to achieve real success

00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:06,889
so customers even develop a level of

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,829
immunity to the pricing if you deliver

00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,199
high standards to them and the Apple

00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:14,539
pricing strategy is a great example of

00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,610
that phenomenon and I think you all will

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:18,879
agree to that but even though their

00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,680
computers and mobile devices

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,829
continuously increase in prices their

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,409
customer base still continue to stay

00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:30,169
loyal to them because of the high

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:33,889
standards so according to Forbes just

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:36,759
one happy customer we'll spread a

00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:40,459
positive word to at least 10 people

00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:45,170
imagine the valuable prospects created a

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:48,439
loyal customer will stick with you and

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:51,529
not only promote your brand but he will

00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:59,769
also be there when times are hard to

00:08:51,529 --> 00:09:02,360
support according to Swami Vivekanand I

00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,529
really love this quote as well which

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:10,350
says loyalty is

00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:12,390
and if you find it keep it so if you get

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,149
loyal customers you should value them

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:18,959
you should keep them for your life long

00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:24,600
and they will give you the best return

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:28,260
which you need for your business it says

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,899
it costs five times as much as to

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,660
attract a new customer than to keep an

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,089
existing one and it's so true that

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,920
customer liquid didn't cost are

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:43,470
skyrocketing gaining new customers is a

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,420
hard process costing about five times as

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,390
much as retaining an existing customer

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,660
that's the reason why so many businesses

00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,480
have started focusing on retaining

00:09:51,660 --> 00:10:02,430
customers they have already gained over

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:10,110
time the probability to selling an

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:12,300
existing customer is 60 to 70 times 70%

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,320
sorry while the probability of selling

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:20,700
to a new customer is just five to twenty

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:25,140
percent so who should you focus more the

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,600
clearly states that if you focus more

00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,120
towards the people who are with you who

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,690
are loyal and who are sticking around

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,959
with you then the probability of selling

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:40,980
to them increases to 60 to 70% while the

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,640
probability to selling a new person will

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,200
be just five to twenty percent so in the

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,720
initial phase of the business the

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,990
paramount focus will be on acquiring new

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,720
customers however as the business

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:58,320
evolves the focus may start drifting

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,449
more towards customer retention while

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,720
you will still be looking to acquire new

00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:07,170
customers retaining the existing ones

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,630
will ensure you maximize your revenues

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,899
and keeping your business

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,800
buoyant it is estimated that the odds or

00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,670
the probability of selling lies between

00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,090
60 to 70 per

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,520
sent to the existing while the new one

00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:25,800
will just be five to twenty percent so

00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,950
this shows that by concentrating on

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,370
existing customers you can drive and

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,980
increase more lifetime value of your

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,490
customer which we say in short form as

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:42,900
LTV so according to this business and

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:47,340
Claire PDR Shopify LTV is the amount of

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:50,280
money a customer is expected to spend in

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,170
your business during their lifetime

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,470
so that is why it is very important to

00:11:52,170 --> 00:12:00,330
prioritize more of your resources on

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:03,810
keeping your existing customers happy so

00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:06,870
they can come again make a purchase do

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,640
the customer renewals and as the

00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,130
customer renewals are what keep the

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,430
recurring revenue occurring so it is

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:18,120
correct to say here that it's a 80/20

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:21,210
rule that applies which states 80% of

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:27,990
your revenue comes from 20% of your

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:30,600
regular customers a marketing metrics

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,640
study found that if a customer has made

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,310
at least one purchase in the past

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:42,950
there's 60% more likely to make a

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:47,010
purchase from you again now it states

00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:51,420
47% of customers who experience bad

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:56,150
service they change providers within 24

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:58,440
no 48 hours so there is so much of

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,690
options available there is so much a

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:06,420
competition that they can go to some

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:08,700
other competitor and they can purchase

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,340
from there so there can be n number of

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,180
complaints reason for it so complain

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:17,370
handling is a critical skill when things

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,530
go wrong so your customers are the

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,870
lifeline of your business a business

00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:25,010
without customers is like balloon

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,760
without air without them you won't

00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:31,190
reason to keep your company growing

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,070
their Salesforce discovered churn the

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:37,340
process where a company slowly dies from

00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:40,450
runaway customer attrition rate is the

00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:43,220
real thing and can literally leads to

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,160
corporate doom so you don't want to

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,920
happen that only when all the gears in

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,630
your company are well-oiled and tightly

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,620
connected you can expect the best

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,620
results

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,980
so I'll talk about the emotions of the

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,860
customers what goes in their mind when

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,770
they are on your website or if they are

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,960
seeing your product why are the emotions

00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:21,110
that goes in give a look on this picture

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,330
which clearly states some of the

00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:27,140
emotions like is this brand offering

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:29,690
value for money do they have more

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,120
choices I just love this brand

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,360
I appreciate for being responsive do I

00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:38,450
still need to call or write an email to

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,670
their support I can resonate with their

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:44,210
language so these are some of the

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:47,960
emotions so how you make them feel is

00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:51,410
very important because that's where they

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,050
will be making choice for now and for

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,490
future so customer engagement goes

00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,070
beyond your product

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:03,340
it thrives on three and four sale

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:07,280
conversations that focus on your buyers

00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:10,790
problems and successes with or without

00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,190
your product at their disposal just

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,950
builds your impression as a brand if

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,860
customer has reached you on social media

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:21,470
because it is the most comfortable way

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,110
for them to communicate don't force them

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,720
to make a call or send an email and

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,750
follow one protocol rather than offer

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,900
them some other choices which is

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:36,320
flexible for them as for their easy so

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:39,140
be flexible and yes try to understand

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,990
what customers really want from your

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,990
business and which features and benefits

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,380
will keep them satisfied enough to stay

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,830
around for longer but how do you keep

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:55,370
your existing customers coming back for

00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:58,370
more how do you I think by now we all

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,610
agree that yes there are many advantages

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:04,670
many benefits to keep our customers

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:08,420
coming back to us and we need our

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:10,340
customer we need to retain them we need

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,330
to convert them from users to happy

00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:17,220
customers but how to do that

00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:20,170
so I'm proposing here four wheels of

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:26,260
customer retention and what are these

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:29,980
wheels let's have a look the first wheel

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,910
which I am proposing is connect so how

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,540
you should connect with your users

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:39,160
personal touch

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:42,970
listen educate and be responsible so

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,910
what do you do while or what I actually

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:49,209
mean by listen so it all starts with

00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:53,140
empathy hearing will not solve the

00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:55,839
purpose you need to listen to your

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:59,350
customers carefully for their ultimate

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:03,780
satisfaction dive deeper to understand

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:08,890
their goals pain points culture entrust

00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:11,770
etc personal touch you need to tailor

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,589
content you know rewards and

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:18,790
opportunities to your customers add

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:22,689
their names to your emails take notes of

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:25,270
their purchases preferences searches

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:28,809
make suggestions and remember their

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,419
birthday yeah for example Netflix ejects

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:33,280
programs for you to watch based on the

00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,130
Preferences that has gathered from your

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,530
previous watching history as well as

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,470
other programs which you have liked

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:46,780
taking the level of personalization one

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:49,630
further educate when customer first buys

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,970
from business of course they know

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,290
nothing about the organization or how

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:58,660
their process works educating customers

00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:03,100
on existing features by providing the

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:06,309
context needed to help them become more

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,340
successful according to their desired

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:12,669
outcomes the content that you've shared

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,070
with an added value in a form of for

00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,370
example knowledgebase articles tips and

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:21,160
tricks service updates and special

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:25,270
offers can keep your customers satisfied

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,559
happy and most of all loyal be

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,600
responsible

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,350
does that mean actually that response

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,169
time is very crucial in many businesses

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,659
you could create a segmented group of

00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:39,490
people who have logged support tickets

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:42,059
on your website then you can create

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,909
marketing campaigns that specifically

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,429
target to this group of customers

00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:50,499
assuring them that your company is

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:53,889
committed to resolve complaints and

00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:55,990
doing what it takes to make customers

00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:59,019
happy show them that you are responsible

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,809
you are listening to them and you're

00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:07,809
taking the appropriate measures to make

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:11,409
them happy the second wheel which I

00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:14,350
propose is engaged now how to engage

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:18,299
with your customers how to keep them

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:22,210
engaged the scows basic expectations

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:25,840
provide solutions and deliver to promise

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,029
yes basic expectations you know like

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,059
customers would love to do business with

00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:35,440
the companies that understand them speak

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:38,470
to their goals entrust and values to

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,600
achieve this nap your customer persona

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:43,990
as well which we have done in the very

00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,960
first phase of identify customers so set

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:52,929
that standard very clearly that their

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:56,169
basic expectations are met provide

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:59,350
solutions always engage and re-engage

00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:01,299
customers with your brand or business no

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,700
matter how you connect with your

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:06,399
customers online or offline

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,330
communication should take place at

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:13,570
multiple points before during and after

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,759
the transaction chair momentum if you

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:18,730
have it flaunt it you know share

00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:21,460
exciting stories of loyal customers to

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,409
gain new customers and remind existing

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,220
customers why they love and vouch for

00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:26,950
you

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,200
nothing resonates with customers as much

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:32,379
as compelling stories about customers

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,970
like themselves who face and solve

00:20:32,379 --> 00:20:40,970
similar problems deliver to promise yes

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:44,059
the team needs to go above and beyond

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:46,399
when something has be messed up for a

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,940
customer to make sure it does not happen

00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:49,639
again

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:52,399
so don't simply apologize take the

00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:54,970
ownership and take out time to follow up

00:20:52,399 --> 00:21:00,679
and let them know that the problems

00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:02,690
solve to restore their confidence taking

00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:05,809
appropriate measures to resolve the

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:08,929
problem set you aside from other

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:13,970
competitor brands and is thus positively

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:18,009
related to satisfaction with restoring

00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:20,330
the customer relationship when a CSM

00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:23,139
apologizes to a customer either for

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,470
themselves or on behalf of the company

00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:31,070
they can weigh empathy politeness

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:35,450
courtesy concern effort all of which go

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:37,730
a long way the third measure which I am

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:40,279
proposing is measure

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:44,299
that's the third wheel how do you

00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:49,700
measure to interview survey questions

00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:52,039
feedbacks and reference so carefully

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,019
look at customer health metrics such as

00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:59,570
customer engagement and Net Promoter

00:21:54,019 --> 00:22:01,789
Score NPS usage metrics such as product

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,399
usage and adoption and the metrics of

00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:06,860
your customer success team's performance

00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:10,879
to determine if you need to take any

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:14,090
additional action focus on needle moving

00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:17,960
insights and real-world customer data

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:20,590
from these units the survey results

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,980
shows that a small percentage of people

00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:27,500
wanted more contact that they wanted the

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,899
same deals as new customers and they

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,360
wanted easy access to their providers

00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:38,210
always take their feedback seriously

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:41,389
even even if it is negative that will

00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:46,340
help you anticipate as there lies the

00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:48,919
scope of opportunities so make a solid

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,480
kind of counter case for your product be

reference yes no form of advertisement

00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:18,630
is more valuable than a direct referral

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:21,539
people who you could trust the most are

00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:25,440
the ones that can implants and motivate

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:27,440
you to be a part of the product to to

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,389
figure out the customer retention

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,659
calculate how many customers you have at

00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:35,220
the end of your given period - the

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:37,850
number of new customers you acquire

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,740
during that time and divide the sum by

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,200
the number you had at the beginning of

00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,740
the time period and then multiply by 100

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,440
once you have your customer retention

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,080
rate you can get to work identifying

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,779
which segments of the customers are more

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,799
or Lowell and which ones have a higher

00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:01,110
churn rate by analyzing customer data

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,019
then you can create real retention

00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:07,409
campaigns let's speak specifically to

00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,370
the segments that are likely more to

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:14,970
churn so by speaking to these groups

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:16,950
before they actually churn you can

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,309

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,320
