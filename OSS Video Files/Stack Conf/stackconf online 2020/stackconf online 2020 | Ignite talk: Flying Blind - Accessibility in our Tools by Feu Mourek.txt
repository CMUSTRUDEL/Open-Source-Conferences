Title: stackconf online 2020 | Ignite talk: Flying Blind - Accessibility in our Tools by Feu Mourek
Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	Do you know what it feels like to navigate as someone who can’t distinguish between green and red – looking at those badges that tell you whether something is broken or a-okay?
I’ll give you a quick look into what it feels like with some examples from the monitoring tool Icinga Web 2.
We all tend to forget, that not everyone sees the world like we do.
In this talk I’ll be walking you through different views in Icinga Web 2 with side-by-side comparisons for the default views and how different kinds of vision impairments affect those.
The talks also features a few suggestions on how to improve colour schemes and making websites and webapps better to navigate with screen readers!

00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:17,670
hello everyone this topic is flying

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,170
blind accessibility in a single where I

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,960
want to walk you through the worlds of

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,640
people with visual impairments before we

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,669
dive into that my name is Juan mark and

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,380
my pronouns are Bay then I started out

00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:33,690
as a developer is in there and nowadays

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,910
the job title is development advocate

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,130
that means unbasic aliy the development

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,840
community interface and I really like

00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:44,210
changing things that just see how they

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,260
look a definition of accessibility

00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,540
according to the Cambridge business

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,730
English Dictionary is the quality or

00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:55,700
characteristic or something that makes

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,700
it possible to approach enter or use it

00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,790
the main focus today will be visual

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,640
impairment this includes color vision

00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,970
deficiencies and complete inability to

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,080
init interact with visual elements first

00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:17,180
we'll look at the numbers there are

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,550
roughly 285 million blind and visually

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,680
impaired people out there it's just a

00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:24,229
little less than the entire population

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,729
of the states roughly one in 11 people

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,729
that's a lot

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
our eyes have three Cairns of colour

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,120
vision

00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,850
red green and blue those are allows

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,580
humans to see the spectrum we can by

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,470
mixing those three colors together but

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,100
as all things now buddies those can

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,290
malfunction in most cases they won't be

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,160
completely unable to distinguish between

00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,360
certain colors it's just a little harder

00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,640
but since we want to be inclusive to

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,560
everyone I'll just be looking at actual

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,300
full of blindness from here on the three

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,700
currents correspond to the three

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,310
variants deuteron open protanopia

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,070
commonly refer to as red-green blindness

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,380
and the rarer form of Triton Opia

00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,380
sometimes called yellow blue diamonds

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,420
to give a better picture of what it

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,340
looks like in practice the squares in

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,409
the first row are the unaltered a single

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,420
colors below I have simulation what they

00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,900
look like in the three variants of color

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,900
blondes

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,790
this is the tactical overview and what

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,650
it looks like with the deform theme as

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,049
you can see especially if you look at

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,299
the labels in the legend colors for the

00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:41,450
states and rather difficult to tell

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,450
apart

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,220
while you can and still understand the

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,260
information from the context in the

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,739
donut it's not possible in the service

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,010
grid

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:57,530
in the second picture which serves a

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,530
critical on the third which are pending

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,280
and this is why I festival design is

00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,739
important there are a lot of people

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,989
affected and usually don't even know and

00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:11,430
it's crucial that we don't withhold

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,430
important information from

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,680
using the web has a colorblind thing and

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,019
it doesn't just work with hues but also

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,200
with different stages of brightness to

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,599
signal severity so in the top rows you

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,390
see the default theme and the bottom on

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,860
the colorblind theme

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,000
so here's the pictures again for

00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,480
comparison without the theme and with it

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
enabled

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,450
colors in the gridview are also a lot

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,640
better distinguishable more every state

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,070
has both the distinguishing color and

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,080
brightness that helps figure out which

00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,080
items are more important at that moment

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,610
designing for people who cannot see at

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,799
all is a little bit from as you can

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,590
imagine the colors and shapes don't

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,510
matter at all in this case so in order

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,599
to design for blindness you need to

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:19,840
understand how as people see host

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:25,210
summary 0 coasts down 17 up service

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,870
summary 0 services critical 104 OK for

00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,870
warning

00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,240
in order for a screen reader to know

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,310
what to read out in which order you need

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,950
to separate the structure from the

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:43,600
styling in your HTML that means though

00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:47,140
BR tags make those spaces in your CSS

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,020
Araya means accessible rich Internet

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,630
application arise a set of attributes

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,780
that the find ways to make web more

00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:57,790
accessible it supplements HTML so

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,110
interactions can be easily passed

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:03,700
assistive technology so without in mind

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,890
if you want to build a web page your

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,620
application take the third time to think

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,620
about your audience and have a nice day

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:28,850
