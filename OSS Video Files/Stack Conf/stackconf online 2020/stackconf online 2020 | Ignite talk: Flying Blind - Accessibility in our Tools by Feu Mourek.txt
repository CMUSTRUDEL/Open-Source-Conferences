Title: stackconf online 2020 | Ignite talk: Flying Blind - Accessibility in our Tools by Feu Mourek
Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	Do you know what it feels like to navigate as someone who can’t distinguish between green and red – looking at those badges that tell you whether something is broken or a-okay?
I’ll give you a quick look into what it feels like with some examples from the monitoring tool Icinga Web 2.
We all tend to forget, that not everyone sees the world like we do.
In this talk I’ll be walking you through different views in Icinga Web 2 with side-by-side comparisons for the default views and how different kinds of vision impairments affect those.
The talks also features a few suggestions on how to improve colour schemes and making websites and webapps better to navigate with screen readers!
