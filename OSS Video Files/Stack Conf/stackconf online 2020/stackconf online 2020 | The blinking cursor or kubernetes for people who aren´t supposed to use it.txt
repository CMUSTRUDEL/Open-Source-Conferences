You’ve got kubernetes up and running, and you’re ready for it to change your life! But, all you see now is a blinking cursor. What do you do now?!

This talk explains what cloud native development is, how kubernetes supports it, and give you a toolkit to start planning for how you’ll use kubernetes to improve the way your organization builds, runs, and manages your software. Drawing on case studies, you’ll get a brief introduction to what kubernetes is from a developer’s perspective and then guidance on how to use kubernetes as the basis for your organization’s development stack.

Large organizations that are managing and modernizing thousands of applications are planning out their new application platform, likely to be used for the next decade. This talk covers how to start planning for that platform:

1. Understanding what kubernetes does and what you’ll need to add on.
2. Planning for large scale app modernization, like the 2,000+ apps at AirFrance-KLM.
3. Meatware re-platforming – to take advantage of your new platform, like The Home Depot & Daimler, you’ll need to change how you work.

After this talk, you’ll have a better idea of what to do next once you’re faced with the blinking cursor.
