Title: stackconf online 2020 | Ignite talk: Build your own S3 storage with min.io by Stefan Sels
Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	min.io allows you to setup an S3 storage on your private cloud infrastructure that is 100% compatible with AWS (you can use the AWS S3 client to interact with min.io). It has a wide range of authentication and notification options. For instance you trigger a webhook to your REST API if a file is created and automatically process them. It is optimized for high performance and is used in production.
