Modern data-intensive microservice applications live in cloud and containers, they use machine learning techniques and serverless functions in data pipelines. Microservices should be efficient, scalable and decoupled, but the integration of services is very challenging through the application’s code. I will show how this can be accomplished by using service mesh that
fundamentally changes how services are managed without changing the single line of code in services. Application’s code stays simpler and easier to maintain, which is preferable in many ways for both developers and operations, and on the other hand – scalability, security and observability increases.
