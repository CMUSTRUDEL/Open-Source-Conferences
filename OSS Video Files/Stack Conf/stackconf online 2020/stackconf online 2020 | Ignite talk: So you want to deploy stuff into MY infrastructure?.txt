Title: stackconf online 2020 | Ignite talk: So you want to deploy stuff into MY infrastructure?
Publication date: 2020-06-27

Description: 
	...by Sebastian Gumprich

This ignite talk is about high-level requirements that I, as an operations-person, talk about with developers when they want to deploy their new software in “my” platform and how I’ll help them achieve these. They include (among other things) topics like software-architecture, backup and recovery, monitoring, logging and high availability.

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:18,810
oh you want to deploy a soft plan to my

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,660
infrastructure not in my backyard well

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,490
okay I'll let you deploy Esther but only

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,320
if it can answer me some questions about

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,939
yourself yeah and show me that you

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,610
thought about how software works and

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,230
works don't have answers that's okay

00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,030
I'll help you anyway

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,579
that's what your friendly systems

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,260
administrator is therefore I'm not the

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:41,760
best at all from hell

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,070
yet okay first tell me something about

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,100
the architecture of just of there does

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,930
it look like this or is it easy don't

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,700
have to create too fancy about this

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,200
just show me that you put some thought

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,600
into how your application works next

00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,640
tell me something about the capacity

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,340
yourself planet Earth need persistent

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,259
storage how much memory CPU and

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
bandwidth does it need what's the

00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:09,570
baseline need and what are the maximum

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,619
needs if you don't know any numbers to

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,680
ease questions

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,450
don't worry we can find out we probably

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
have to use slow tests and end-to-end

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,950
tests to get some estimations we can

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,320
work with and of course is numb as can

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,020
and will change we just have to pre

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,020
prepare for this eating our preparation

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,179
do you have a plan how to backup and

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,909
restore your software's data and how to

00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:35,159
do a disaster recovery if not that's

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,069
okay tell me what data needs to be

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,580
backed up often and how to restore it

00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,590
and I take care of it

00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,780
we also find out how long a full restore

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:47,540
takes or we can reflect within the

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,220
disaster recovery post you just have to

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,380
make sure the application still works

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,710
out easy right

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,860
picking up data where will you store

00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,570
your soft test data

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,790
and what kind of data do you understand

00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,850
is it personally identifiable

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,040
information if yes tell me we need to

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,289
understand classify and document what

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,929
kind of data we store or we can take

00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:12,880
appropriate measures to secure on

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,300
important thing about securing data

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,450
encryption who fingers here first ADA

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,220
must be stored and threads but encrypted

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,300
second do not worry your own crypto a

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:28,150
repeat will not roll your own crypto

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,530
next monitoring show me how to monitor

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,260
on the interest state of the application

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,660
as well as head-to-head behavior I'd

00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,940
also like to define some alerts in case

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,100
the application goes down these alerts

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,610
need to be actionable for me what I can

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,520
do to fix the problems except logging if

00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:48,340
me meaningful readable lock messages now

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,560
2,000 light non-stop traces also make

00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,140
the logging configurable or the output

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,070
is usable by the consuming system I can

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,950
Alex take owners make relaxed fractions

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,140
or I can give our metrics from them even

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,540
more bonus you find some actionable

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,580
alerts for each lock messages when

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,299
you'll be on call we know what happens

00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,180
and what to do authentication and

00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:15,070
authorization this other worlds and

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,290
permissions concept on how to access

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,810
yourself there in it think about

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,940
personal accounts perfectly connected to

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,400
a central directory server and think

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,410
about automation or service accounts for

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,620
all requests are authenticated and

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,930
authorized and please work with the

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,430
least privileged principle accounts

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,519
should only have access to things they

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,100
need existing owners build single

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,930
sign-on and to your login process

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,260
nobody wants to memorize yet another log

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,390
in X topic as your software needs to be

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,030
highly available does it need to be

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,610
redundant if yes what happens when a

00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,180
machine dies a wreck fields of a cluster

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,519
goes offline

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,430
bottoms of the network between two data

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,470
centers yourself parents and fails if

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,660
the software talks to some kind of bacon

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,670
how do we detect when the bacon dies

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,739
what does the software doing

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,170
can you restart or terminate your

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:10,630
software without affecting users these

00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,970
are many questions I know and there are

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,400
even more things we could talk about if

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,830
this would not be an egg nog things like

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,410
load balancing rate limiting timeouts

00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:23,620
retry and error re handling behavior and

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,180
many more I don't worry if I don't give

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,900
up what's really needed for yourself

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,750
there a spot do you have any external

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,910
dependencies you rely on like public 8

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,770
the ice or services from other teams in

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,900
your company if yes

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,760
get me a list of them and describe how

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,039
they are used there are also money to

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,800
Army's dependencies cos weekend and row

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,389
fail

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,000
most of this stuff I learned the hard

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,220
way many people that will say however

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,699
they wrote down the issues they faced

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,039
I didn't who here are my sources okay

00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,750
it was probably much information for

00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,909
five minutes and it's okay if you don't

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,560
remember everything but if you want to

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:02,970
get something useful out of this talk

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,190
remember one thing

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,099
talk to a friendly system administrator

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,930
or just for yourself well but one thanks

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,060
for listening I'm not on Twitter or

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,620
Facebook or LinkedIn so just shoot me an

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:24,360
email if you want to talk

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:24,360
[Music]

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,100
