Title: stackconf online 2020 | The Path to OpenSource DBaaS with Kubernetes by Peter Zaitsev
Publication date: 2020-06-27
Playlist: stackconf online 2020
Description: 
	DBaaS is the fastest growing way to deploy databases. It is fast and convenient and it helps to reduce toil a lot, yet it is typically done using proprietary software and tightly coupled to the cloud vendor. We believe Kubernetes finally allows us to build fully OpenSource DBaaS Solution capable to be deployed anywhere Kubernetes runs â€“ on the Public Cloud or in your private data center.
In this presentation, we will describe the most important user requirements and typical problems you would encounter building DBaaS Solution and explain how you can solve them using Kubernetes Operator framework.
