Playlist: Angular Vienna
Description: 
	There is not a sole adjusting screw for performance tuning in single page applications but even several influencing factors that need to be considered. This talk shows how to deal with them.
You'll learn how to leverage Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT), Tree Shaking and Lazy Loading to improve the startup performance of your application dramatically. For this, we'll look at the Angular Build Optimizer as well as at Googleâ€™s Closure compiler that allows aggressive optimizations. In addition to that you'll see how to use the optimization strategy OnPush to speed up data binding performance in your solutions. Furthermore, Service Worker for caching and instant loading will be covered as well as Server Side Rendering to improve the perceived loading time.
