Publication date: 2019-12-13
Playlist: Angular Vienna
Description: 
	Talk by Michael Hladky,


Ever heard about "ephemeral state"?

Ngrx, ngxs, akita etc did a great job in managing global state in SPAs.
However, nobody talked about the complexity and pain of managing the local component state.
Based on a quote of “Gang of Four”:
“If you stick to the paradigms of OOP the design patterns appear naturally”
I will solve isolates problems in a reactive way and the final design pattern for reactive component state results naturally.

If you attend this talk you will hear about:
- subscrption-less components
- local state management
- handling local side-effects
You will be able to write fully reactive components that will be well structured and organized without any effort.
