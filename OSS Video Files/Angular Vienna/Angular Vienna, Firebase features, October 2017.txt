consultant and trainer and I focus

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,970
mainly on angular and I really really

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,360
love it I love it so much that in my

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,340
free time I do a lot of angular I'm I'm

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,950
the founder of ng girls and we do

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,420
workshops for free workshops for women

and this Thursday we're going to have

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,229
one in Freiburg in Germany and then

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,299
we're going to have an angular connect

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:38,310
and we have all over the world even in

00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:40,799
as far as Colombia Medine is so if you

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,890

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,950
mentors boys and girls so come talk to

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,909
me another thing that I'm doing in my

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,780
free time is I organize the angular

00:01:50,909 --> 00:02:00,600
Knights meetup which is also about

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:09,209
working learning angular a after after

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:12,959
work at night right so witchcraft so at

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:16,349
night we as witches go and

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,159
and make spells for angular so instead

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:23,340
of like showing slides and showing you

00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,780
the which book and everything we're just

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,349
going to do some live coding all right

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:35,909
all right so I've prepared here that was

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:37,909
oh no wait a minute recorded recording

00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:42,150
stopped wait a minute

00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:49,260
for some reason okay that's gonna be I

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:52,530
hope it works okay so what did I want to

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:57,329
say that we're going to connect this

00:02:52,530 --> 00:03:01,700
very nice application to firebase of

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:04,349
course I'm going to open the dev tools

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,689
because whenever we develop an

00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,689
application we're working with the dev

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,790
tools open right what's that slow

00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:15,629
Network is detected oh no I hope it

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:22,139
works okay so we probably don't see a

00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:26,430
lot okay and this application is going

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:29,519
to be deployed today now in half an hour

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,579
so you're going to show your tips for me

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,060
for Vienna I'm going to be here until

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:39,030
tomorrow afternoon so the more tips

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,939
you're gonna put here the crazier it's

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,069
going to be for me tomorrow all right

00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:46,919
yeah okay

00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:49,949
so let's see what we have here we can

00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,989
sign in with Google so right now if

00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:56,040
we're clicking it nothing happens only a

00:03:51,989 --> 00:04:00,150
console log and you can share your

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,449
recommendations like nothing happens

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:09,180
just again console.log and you can also

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:11,459
edit your own recommendations your own

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,680
tips only your own tips but again

00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:18,269
nothing happens at the moment it isn't

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:23,700
saved and so I opened a firebase project

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:26,490
for that and the first thing that we

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,360
need to do is to add firebase to

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,430
webapp okay so we have here this

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,949
configuration which gives us everything

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,830
that we need to connect our web our

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,500
application to firebase alright I

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:42,990
already copied it I will paste it in a

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,460
moment I hope it will work also one

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:48,720
thing that you need to do actually

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:51,360
before you get this configuration is

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,819
going to sign-in method and choose what

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,759
I'm sign-in method you want to have

00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:03,330
so I enabled Google and we're going to

00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:05,130
use that you can use you can use email

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,490
and password even phone of

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,310
authentication a Facebook Twitter github

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,900
and anonymous anonymous means that a

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,740
user can start using your application

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,210
without being signed in and they the

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,000
data will still be saved

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:24,750
and when this user decides to sign up

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,539
somehow then their data will be copied

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,159
to the new user that is created now

00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,770
another smart thing that you have with

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,169
firebase is that if a user signs in with

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,060
several different methods like Google

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:41,099
Facebook email and password but it's

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,440
always with the same email then then if

00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:45,930
I base recognizes but it's the same user

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,940
and we'll give them the same data but

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,380
you can also turn off this feature if

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,030
you want so you can have multiple

00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:58,710
accounts for different signing methods

00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:01,139
whoever's yeah yes so you can also use

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,719
cont accustomed providers using Google

00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:07,500
Cloud functions connecting them it's

00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:09,419
through there you can add this a little

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,860
bit more complicated but just a little

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,289
bit very easy

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,210
overall ok Google is like the easiest

00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,610
way because I don't have to now go to

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,639
Google and add my application there it's

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,630
already firebase is part of Google I was

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:30,569
using firebase already just so I know ok

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:34,830
cool who's using angular Wow ok so I'm

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:38,120
in the right place just checking ok so

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:38,120
I'm going to environment

00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:46,870
and here I'm just pasting this is the

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,630
environment a file and we have two

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,660
different files one for production and

00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,730
one this is for development one for

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:59,130
production and you can add more

00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:02,050
environments so I'll also add this too

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,600
to the production one so when we build

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,610
the application and deploy it it will

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,900
take the configuration from here but

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:16,150
good practice have several different a

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:19,300
firebase projects for each environment

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,670
okay because if you're developing you

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,880
don't want to mess with the production

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:29,980
data right so you can actually put here

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,230
something else okay and first thing that

00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,669
we need to know oh I also wanted to show

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,710
you before I'm starting to connect

00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:41,230
everything I wanted to show you what

00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:43,210
happens when a user is signed in so if

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:47,050
if they're not signed in then you have

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:54,210
this a button sign-in with Google and if

00:07:47,050 --> 00:08:00,880
they are then let's put here a user and

00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:03,960
you will get something like that that

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,870
[Laughter]

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,380
okay cool so how do we do that so first

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,330
of all we're using here a not only

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,430
firebase but also angular fire which is

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,710
a library that helps us connect a

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,430
angular with firebase or the other way

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,890
around and there is an firebase SDK that

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,830
you can use for for all your

00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:29,580
applications but that's the cool thing

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,650
in angular fire is that it uses

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:38,380
observables which we already have and a

00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:40,990
like in angular with our XJS so it

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:44,770
leverages their strengths so we're gonna

00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:49,690
use that also okay so to start working

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:51,540
with that we need to first import the

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,700
angular fire module

00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:00,470
into our application module so angular

00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:05,250
can you see this is it big enough okay

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:12,089
angularfire module and we init it with

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:14,399
our configuration so environment just

00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:18,000
what the default environment firebase

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,240
config that's it we have we have now

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,180
connected a firebase to angular fire

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,279
into our application now another thing

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,620
that we're going to need now we're going

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:35,360
to start with the authentication so

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:38,970
let's add a angular fire and a fire

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,480
authentication module earth model and

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,190
now we can start working with that so in

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,829
the user component component we're

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:53,519
expecting a user but actually we can

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:58,350
also have with firebase a continuous

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,060
status of the user okay a real-time

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,339
status so if you're signing or signed

00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,000
out so let's see how we do this in the

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,410
user service first of all now a lot of

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,870
tutorials and examples on the web will

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,350
show you how to do this directly in the

00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:16,050
component which is great for just demo

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,110
for for showing you how to work with it

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,060
but it's not good practice so do this in

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,380
the service okay so just like I do now

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:28,079
so so you see that right now signing in

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:32,459
and signing out just the console logs so

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,620
we inject the Oh what do we need to do

00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:38,820
before we inject the service into some

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:44,730
other service to provide it yeah thank

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:50,000
you okay so we provide here angular fire

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:58,680
off alright awesome

00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,860
so private AF off only half an hour to

00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,410
do lots of witchcraft

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,410
and what do you think I'm gonna make it

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,410
yeah

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,200
okay so angularfire also gives us

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:23,900
signing methods and sign out methods so

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:26,810
let's implement them so this F auth it's

00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:32,630
okay we're signing in with a provider so

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:38,160
we're going to do a is where is my hot

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:39,280
thing okay I have my which book here

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,600
[Music]

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:46,960
auth sign in with pop-up and then we

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,370
have to give it a provider so we do new

00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,580
firebase so that's actually going

00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:59,090
straight to firebase yes I want to

00:11:52,580 --> 00:12:07,520
import firebase of not provided Google

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:10,490
Google Google auth provider yeah so I'm

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,650
creating a new instance of that and of

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,720
course you have the instances for all

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:17,870
the other providers and that's it now

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,790
this function returns a promise and you

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,330
can deal with it of course you can do

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,650
then and catch and whatever you want but

00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm not going to deal with it right now

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:34,940
and to sign out a if off look how great

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:43,940
webstorm is giving me that this awesome

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:45,550
and guess what sign out that's it that's

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,060
it

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:56,990
again promise okay so you can do return

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:59,060
and so on and now let's see we still

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,880
haven't connected the user we still

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:07,370
don't get the user data in the in our

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,780
component okay so angular fire has

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,040
really something really really great

00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:14,950
[Music]

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:21,010
called

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:27,580
earth state which is not which is which

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:29,740
is an observable and it like I said

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:34,120
before it gives us the status of the

00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:37,779
user all the time ok so we're going to

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:42,430
actually pass it to our user observable

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:47,200
and the dollar sign here is a convention

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:50,050
for observables so that we know that we

00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,350
have to subscribe to it and so on right

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,570
so now we have the user observable which

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,959
is public and we can use it in our

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:02,290
component so let's go back to our user

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,779
component now I can't just pass it as a

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,300
user now it's going to be a user

00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:13,899
observable so let's first of all take

00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:15,899
this a grab this again here ok so we

00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:19,690
have the user and we're already

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:23,560
injecting the user service and we'll

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:29,860
just do this user will get it from the

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:32,170
user service just getting it user ok we

00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,120
could have done it also like more

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,350
straightforward but it's like better to

00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,589
separate these things

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:43,690
okay so observables what do we need to

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:46,959
get the data from observables yeah we

00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:50,680
need to subscribe to it right but what

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:54,760
does angular give us okay you're awesome

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,880
you're really also ok so we're just

00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:05,589
going to subscribe to it here in the ng

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:08,050
if so user observable a a sink and a

00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:10,240
really cool trick that you have so that

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,640
you don't need to do this for every part

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,040
in the component that needs data from

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,610
the user observable or the user data

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:22,810
actually is if you if you're using ng if

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:25,900
then you can take the value and put it

00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,870
as something else so as user okay so now

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,529
user will

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,180
all the data from the observable and we

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:35,250
can use it wherever we want in our

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,730
application for example in our user

00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:42,630
avatar and user display name and so on

00:15:38,730 --> 00:16:00,089
ok you want to see it in action alright

00:15:42,630 --> 00:16:06,290
so recompiling and no yeah all right I'm

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:10,230
sign-in with the Google yeah so we have

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:14,070
we have my name here we have my avatar

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:16,260
that's the one of the one of my many

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,540
accounts avatar this is I don't know if

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,410
you can see it very well this is my cat

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:25,640
you so my dog before this is my cat and

00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,640
what's great about

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:33,750
about this about a firebase and the user

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:37,500
status is that if now I just like

00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:40,410
duplicate this this tab and maybe even

00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,130
just take it away as another wait a

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,950
minute

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,290
let's rearrange them okay so they're

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,510
side by side there's one with without

00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:51,360
the dev tools one with the dev tools

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:55,770
okay so different tabs so if I'm signing

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,589
out in one then I'm signed out also in

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:01,100
the other one if I'm signing in and this

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:04,170
is hell signing with Google works it

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:08,990
opens a new tab and then you have to

00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:11,790
select one of your many accounts and

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,980
then you're signed in okay and this is

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,040
another account that I have and with the

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:22,170
same name no what can I do and you're

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:25,730
also signed in in the different tab Hey

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:31,440
look at that I have different hats here

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:33,480
yeah alright so let's go on with that we

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,160
have the user we can sign in we can sign

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,890
out now we need data right that's it

00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,400
okay so let's close this because I need

00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:46,890
my

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:52,590
webstorm clothes yep all right so we

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:56,580
have in the vienna tips component okay

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:59,010
so we have the input where you insert

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,220
your recommendations and it will submit

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:04,830
the tip and you have the list where you

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,200
view the recommendations now I want to

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:10,220
everybody to be able to see all the

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,110
recommendations all the tips but only

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,900
but you can edit only those that you

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,510
have written by yourself so we'll do

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,860
that with a little bit of server

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:25,890
functions so firebase cloud functions in

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,750
a firebase which is a really cool

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,640
features that really gives us DeeDee

00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:36,060
missing a part of the server let's say a

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:39,240
platform and it was announced on March

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:42,690
so it's pretty new ok so right now I

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,730
just have like the tips here and submit

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:50,070
tip does console.log and edit so ok so

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,920
again we'll go to the service and

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,260
connect it to the database and again

00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:00,000
we'll have an observable of all the list

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:02,340
of tips and we'll use the updating

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,480
methods and put methods of firebase so

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:09,440
let's go to the service here we are ok

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,950
so again to do that you inject the

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:19,220
service we first need to provide it here

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:26,070
so it's a different service angular fire

00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:30,770
database ok we actually also need to

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:34,590
have the module here angular fire a

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:37,170
database module why do we need to put

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,210
this like why can't our base just come

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:48,000
or angular if I come with all these

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:50,160
things by default what do you say yeah

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,590
the bad news getting bitten let's write

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,510
that for tree shaking so ever you want

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,260
to use only authentication you don't

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,300
have to import

00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,540
the code of the module of the database

00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:07,560
right so you all only import whatever

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:12,120
you need okay so now we can inject it

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:16,890
here FDB angularfire

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:21,540
database okay

00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:24,140
and what are we going to do we want to

00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,270
get the tip list right

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:29,610
we actually I don't have it yet in the

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:37,470
in the database at all if you want to

00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:39,810
see the database is has like nothing

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:43,530
okay let's do even get started we should

00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:46,680
do get started before yeah good thing

00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:53,880
that I checked that nothing nothing here

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:57,150
yeah just the you know basic Oh an able

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,190
to what no yeah I knew there should be

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,470
something okay that's what should be

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,470
here now we're gonna meet up now okay

00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:12,290
okay so it's called Vienna meetup good

00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:20,670
thing to know this tips list tip list

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:25,130
will be FDB list right yeah I'm getting

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:26,580
a reference to the list and it's called

00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:33,930
where am I now

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:36,540
yeah Vienna no Vienna meetup right it

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:40,440
was Vienna Meetup okay cool

00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:45,270
and let's also add like a child to it

00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:49,230
so like tips okay um alright red because

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:51,950
we need to add it here okay yeah okay

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:59,060
angularfire yeah sure why not what

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:59,060
cannot fight whatever later later

00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:07,590
okay now this is not enough to get the

00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,400
data again this is well this is almost

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,390
in

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:19,290
what's going to be an observable is when

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:22,260
we do this so we take tip list or tips

00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:27,210
list I'm not really I don't know how the

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:31,320
grammar works and we we can we have two

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:34,110
options here we can take like the value

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,500
of each one of the items on the list

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,750
like only the bare value or we can take

00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,690
a snapshot which also holds more

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:45,770
information for example the key of each

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:51,870
item and we're going to need this key to

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:55,500
be able to to update the right item

00:22:51,870 --> 00:23:00,420
later on okay so I'm going to do instead

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:02,220
of we have here valued value changes but

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:07,350
I'm going to use instead of that

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:11,580
snapshot changes of snap shot changes

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:13,710
okay so this is something new in in the

00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,720
new version of angularfire so if you're

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:20,310
already using it then pay attention

00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,740
that's in angularfire the the library is

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:28,920
called angularfire 2 and it's version 5

00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:31,740
now ok ok so tips ok

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,770
so we can already connect it even though

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:39,600
we don't have any data there so let's

00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:42,510
see our tip component ok so again we

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,570
don't need all these tips now we just

00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:51,600
need an observable of tips and we need

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:59,550
to get it private what was it

00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:02,300
Vienna tips service tips service Vienna

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,300
tips

00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:11,650
tips service all right here we have it

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:15,430
on ng on in it this tips observer are

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:25,960
tips observable is going to get it from

00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:29,470
there okay no oops tips and we're going

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,460
to use it of course here in the list

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:39,280
okay so again not just tips tips of

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:43,330
observable I think all right so I'm

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,250
already doing the repeat for loop on tip

00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:51,070
so I don't have to change anything

00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:52,450
inside so tip has title where do we see

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,300
this title here

00:24:52,450 --> 00:25:00,730
okay I'm using another nice thing that

00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:09,910
we have in ng if so you all know that if

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:11,380
the what directive no like what you

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,810
passed you the directive the condition

00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,460
if the condition is true then it will

00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:20,620
render this element or component and

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:23,470
what you can do is if the condition is

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,720
false then you can pass it a name of a

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:33,010
template that you that you've written

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:35,440
okay and that's here in come on that's

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,330
here in ng template you're using ng

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,790
template and that template will not be

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,280
rendered but you give it this name so

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:46,780
it's the same name but here you put a

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:50,620
hash tag of course and so if the

00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:53,470
condition is false then what's rendered

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:56,650
is what's inside the template okay

00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,680
isn't that cool okay so another thing

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:07,720
that we're using here is also the

00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:10,810
question mark that's okay what you see

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,400
here actually is when you click on the

00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,400
list item then it becomes

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,350
an input and but if you haven't clicked

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:24,610
on it if it's not in editing mode then

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:29,860
it's just the title just the tip that

00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:34,090
title okay so we also have another ng-if

00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:36,850
here and we're not sure that we even

00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:39,010
have editing or if it's now so I don't

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:43,150
want it to check for key inside because

00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:45,370
it will give me an error if we don't

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:48,970
have editing so we put the question mark

00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:52,270
so this syntax is only only if you have

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:56,140
editing then grab the key and if you

00:26:52,270 --> 00:27:01,240
don't have it then just ignore it it

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:03,490
works not only in ng if any binding and

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,800
any interpolation that you have here in

00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:14,350
angular ok so a little bit about let's

00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:16,570
see if it works okay recompiling I

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,520
should have let it compile before that

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,770
we're not supposed to see anything

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,350
because we don't have anything in the

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:26,410
list right and I haven't connected this

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,810
input to the list yet okay so let's do

00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:32,110
it really really quickly

00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:37,350
we already have the submit tip and the

00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:44,190
update tip in the Edit here so let's do

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:51,850
this via native service like save or

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:59,620
submit tip like this okay and we get the

00:27:51,850 --> 00:28:03,490
event target value okay we don't need

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:08,350
this okay submit tip let's go to the

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:12,580
service that's a writer of Asia

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:15,280
okay submit tip a title so the value

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,590
will be the tips title and what we do

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,310
now is just we have already the

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:24,760
reference to the tip list and we do like

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:27,390
just push oh I forgot to do something

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,390
though

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:37,040
wait a minute just say let's push right

00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,059
yeah

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,760
title just care giving the title right

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:46,010
now what I forgot to do is the snapshot

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,540
changes gives us a lot of data and we

00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:53,900
want to map it to get the right data

00:28:49,540 --> 00:29:04,730
that we want okay so we get a tips list

00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:11,360
and we want to do return tips map for

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:17,390
each tip on the list we return an object

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:18,980
of what we have in the tip is snapshot

00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,130
snapshot yeah

00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,900
value so that's the inner value that we

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,740
have which is right now just the title

00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:34,669
and we want to add the key okay

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:35,240
so key will be the tip snapshot key do

00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:37,130
we have it

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,230
yeah all right so we're supposed to get

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:43,130
it now when we turn that went and that

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:45,350
and we can submit tips okay let's see if

00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:49,669

00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:30,570
from here okay and then we pass it the

00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:33,570
key all right so we have a reference to

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:37,140

making sure that it's right yeah title

00:32:49,830 --> 00:33:02,009
okay that's it that's how easy it is

00:32:53,690 --> 00:33:04,489
let's see if it works okay so I want to

00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:08,369
update the angular Meetup

00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:15,360
okay so it's not anger its angular vni

00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:16,619
meetup right all right so it's updated

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,509
let's see

00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:21,179
and we'll have a meet-up that's really

00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:23,480
cool all right so what else do I have to

00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,480
do

00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:33,059
so update edit ah okay that's okay and

00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:35,999
it is just changing into edit mode okay

00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:42,809
so we've covered that all right so now

00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:48,529
what do I have to do yes the update just

00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:48,529
updates whatever I gave it to update

00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:55,559
yeah so it's a patching if I'm only if

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,629
it had more than just the title then it

00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,210
would just go to the title and update it

00:33:57,629 --> 00:34:03,509
but if I if I want to replace the whole

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:06,210
object then I'm going to use a set I

00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,980
think okay but right now we don't have

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,899
anything else but a title but we're

00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:14,579
going to actually add some stuff okay so

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:16,799
what we're going to add to it we're

00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:21,089
going to connect it to firebase so

00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:26,579
firebase in it so I'm going to actually

00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:31,399
put this whole a this whole project I'm

00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:38,129
going to add here firebase configuration

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:40,619
so database hosting and even rules so

00:34:38,129 --> 00:34:44,429
they just asked me for a bunch of

00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:46,230
questions where I am are we going to

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,899
have the rules Oh

00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,559
installing dependencies with NPM okay I

00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,559
hope this works

00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,530
okay and in the meantime let's see if I

00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,260
have something to work with

00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:04,120
okay database rules okay so I want

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:06,760
everybody to be able to read so I'm just

00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:10,990
going to do here true and to write

00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:16,510
actually I want oh I want my director to

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:17,470
be dist and don't know yes I never know

00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,110
but it okay

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:23,850
just override it okay so what I want to

00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:26,470
do with the rules I want to have a own

00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:30,700
like I said to restrict only if it's

00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:38,560
your tip that you can write it edit it

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:41,070
okay so what I'm going to do here okay

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,330
[Music]

00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:47,200
so we're going to have something like

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:50,830
that okay

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:56,320
Vienna tips tips how did I call it

00:35:50,830 --> 00:36:05,670
tips Vienna meetup tips okay Vienna me

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:10,350
top I can open a whole object for that

00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:14,850
tips tips let's open another object and

00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:17,050
we'll say now we have a specific tip

00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:25,050
okay but we don't know how it's called

00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:25,050
so dollar tip will get read permission

00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:34,690
true for everyone and right and that's

00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:40,360
going to be a bit complicated okay only

00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:48,490
if you're authenticated of oh not equals

00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:52,660
now and off provider that I don't care

00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:56,920
about the other provider and either data

00:36:52,660 --> 00:37:03,450
exists that it doesn't exist because

00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:17,600
it's new one or if it exists then a it's

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:24,540
user ID UID its value of the UID Val

00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:26,940
equals to off UID I hope that's alright

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,190
okay I really hope that's alright so

00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:33,870
what I'm doing here is checking whether

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:37,170
the tips you ID equals to the 1/2

00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:39,720
strength to now edit it okay but we

00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,460
don't have the user ID right so how do

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,590
we do that we have now the functions

00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,020
here for firebase so we're going to add

00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:49,680
a function that takes the whenever you

00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:53,840
create a user ID then sorry a tip then

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:58,040
it will add your user ID here alright so

00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:00,840
now I need the other page ok function

00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:11,010
you know X well let's start with export

00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:15,570
export a export export save tip you just

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:22,320
give a name for your function and it

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:25,320
will be triggered functions database ref

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:32,400
we're referencing whatever we want

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:37,790
okay so Vienna meetup it was right

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:40,710
slash tips /id

00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,360
okay so this is the parameter tricky

00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:47,940
news but we don't really need to use

00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:51,420
this and then we say on right on

00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:55,140
why does it okay when you write to it

00:38:51,420 --> 00:39:02,100
when you get an event then what do you

00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:04,320
do with this event if the event or if

00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:09,060
it's something that was initiated by the

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:14,450
admin then return oh I always forget the

00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:17,430
brackets in if a return a otherwise

00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:23,010
return a function that we're going to

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:28,020
- right add you ad with the event okay

00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:36,120
so function add you ID which gets an

00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:43,170
event will be we're taking the data okay

00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:47,300
the original value e data well okay and

00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:59,760
then we're going to yell to add to it

00:39:47,300 --> 00:40:02,610
the UID e of a variable what variable it

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,220
has the UID there and then we're going

00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:08,070
to update ok this also returns a promise

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:13,710
you actually can do even console logs

00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:16,680
here and see see it in the in the

00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:21,510
firebase console and then you update

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:24,300
just like we updated and that just like

00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:27,240
we updated before so it doesn't set the

00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,110
whole valley well we do set the whole

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,040
value here but never mind okay exports

00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:37,710
is that okay

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,160
it's supposed to be okay I hope okay all

00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,650
right

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,080
hopefully it's gonna work really

00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:47,490
hopefully so what we're going to do now

00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,860
is well first of all I can check if it

00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,480
still work no I didn't deployed so let's

00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:55,400
just build and deploy the whole thing

00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,400
and hope that it works alright Angie

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:05,130
what do I have what okay let's see if it

00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,830
fits

00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,200
first of all okay let's see if it builds

00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:12,890
now this is gonna take a little bit of

00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,890
time so

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,320
[Music]

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:38,340
sorry for taking a bit more of your time

00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:42,660
now yeah okay now firebase deploy

00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:45,240
hopefully hopefully with the rules that

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,100
I wrote were are okay all I'm coding

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,750
without copy paste or is no using

00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,300
something else the functions that uh

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:53,130
that I wrote are okay really really hope

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:57,810
that everything is gonna be okay

00:41:53,130 --> 00:42:00,720
and then we'll get a URL that you can

00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:03,180
actually go into and add tips and if

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,970
it's not going to work the URL URL will

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,240
be the same and we'll go to the break

00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:11,460
and during the break fix it but I'm sure

00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,110
it will be ok I'm really sure really

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,940
sure ok it's creating a function now and

00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:22,440
yeah so so you can do the whole thing

00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:26,400
from here you can also write your own

00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,830
functions in in in another project know

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,270
this functions project can be a whole

00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,220
project that you can even write with

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,940
typescript or whatever you want and just

00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:38,190
have everything compile to index J s so

00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:45,900
and then deploy it to firebase alright

00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:46,680
so this is the URL okay it's Vienna -

00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,610
Meetup

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:54,480

00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:59,430
already has my okay Vienna - meet up

00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:02,760

00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:19,740
so if I'm trying to now edit the I am

00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:21,870
first so it will not edit it and it will

00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,690
actually have

00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,700
an arrow here showing that I don't have

00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,490
permissions and like I said before

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,770
please reusing promises so please deal

00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:33,900
with it do a catcherror stuff and you

00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:40,290
know great it's a muttered ball that's a

00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:43,190
really good one yeah okay so what kind

00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:46,380
of a head did you get when you signed in

00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:50,190
alright so hopefully I showed you how

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:53,970
much magic there is in a angola with

00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:57,420
firebase and with angular fire and that

00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:00,540
it's really really easy to connect your

00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,300
application to firebase and it's really

00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:06,060
easy to manage your server or server

00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,190
list server a database and so on another

00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:11,370
small tip that I have about firebase

00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:16,740
there now how have in in beta they have

00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:19,320
a new version of the database which will

00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,420
be built with documents and collections

00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,970
and better querying so there are reduced

00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:28,350
cases most of the use cases you'd like

00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:30,600
to try this out but the old database the

00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:33,510
current one that I was using is really

00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,820
really great for when you're young when

00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,640
you want to really have real time with

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:41,070
several users like Google Docs or

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:47,820
something like that that you can see all

00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:50,730
the users collaborate together so I'm

00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,840
gonna follow all your suggestions where

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,710
is my last slide

00:44:51,840 --> 00:45:04,460

00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:09,150
thing okay ha okay my email my Twitter
