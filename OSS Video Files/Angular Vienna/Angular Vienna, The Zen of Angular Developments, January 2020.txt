Playlist: Angular Vienna
Description: 
	Talk by Will Huang:


Don't write any code before you thinking clearly. There are lots of abstract concepts in the Angular framework. If you want a better quality, faster development, lesser bugs of your Angular application. You need the "Zen" of Angular developments.

In this talk, Will will show you how to build Angular apps easy and fun.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,870
so I probably will ask you many

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,319
Christians so if you could please answer

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,940
me

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,710
is that okay is that okay okay nice so

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,699
today I'm going to talk about the Zen of

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,100
angular development so how many of you

00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:23,550
understand what is Zen

00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:27,960
raise your hand you can understand okay

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:32,309
nice only one man so then is some kind

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,500
of Chinese culture which means you can

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,800
think about things without any

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,969
destruction so you can focus on your

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,370
development or something

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,640
focus anything so let me introduce

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,829
myself first my name is Will and I'm

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,820
from Taiwan I'm the core member of

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:55,289
Indian youth group and I'm angry Gd

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,390
and the max of MVP and I mostly work as

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:02,160
a instructor or consulting in Taiwan and

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:07,049
I have dozens of speaks and speeches and

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,140
training courses in Taiwan okay so there

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:14,130
are few things I want to talk today the

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:19,409
first one is the angular Dave Sita so

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:24,150
what is Sita Sita is kind of spirit of

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:28,710
your mindset so what I said can say

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,020
first learn speed which means and turn

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,390
when you go encoding when do the

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,869
programming you need to think about the

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,180
concept first then you write a code so

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:42,110
cancer is always the most important

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,119
things when you do the developments so

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:51,060
what kind of concept you need to build

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:56,340
at first so all these topics can really

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:59,549
understand the concepts the burster

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,930
process the execution lifecycle do you

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,259
really understand the temperature even

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,799
for reiative phones oh do you really

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,080
know the meaning of the components oh

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,270
you want to integrate orders there are

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,050
components all you want to do the state

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,090
management or

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,490
tuning so all these kind of all concepts

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,870
so when we learn something with Butte

00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:30,630
can say first then we do the real coding

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:34,020
right so then speed so don't talk about

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,900
a speed or the performance the

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,980
efficiency of development before you

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,050
think clearly so the speaker I mentioned

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,650
those three things one is bright typing

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,310
and speed typing I think any one of you

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:55,530
can bright type in is that correct but

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,690
not in Chinese okay so what about speed

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,380
high BSP typing means you can type very

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,860
fast right okay so if you wanna

00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:08,180
development quickly tapping is a very

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,510
important skill so what I say is

00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:15,900
accuracy first Dan speed so that's yeah

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,930
yeah you know what I mean the second one

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,780
is mastering your dev tools that's

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,140
that's a very important concept for me

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,020
and I talked about this concept a lot in

00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,720
my country so don't have if you don't

00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,090
really have to can't really understand

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,709
what I mean

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:41,480
don't type don't type which means your

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:45,840
development tools contains lots of

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,090
productivity features so for example vs

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,380
code there are lots of kasnia bits right

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,650
and lots of refactoring tools

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:58,650
you must be mastering about that to

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,730
reduce your your timing to do the

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:06,060
development okay the third one is

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,630
control the flow state that any one of

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,709
you understand what is flow do you know

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:16,169
little flow is a kind of mindset right

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,269
so when you entering into a flow state

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,070
which means you can forget everything

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:26,210
but there are lots of destruction things

00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:29,150
coming out for example when you

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,060
typing you have a concept first that's

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,729
for sure right but they had so many

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,319
destructions for example if we can the

00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:41,539
syntax of the code do you understand

00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:45,470
import import from the cindex

00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:47,900
yes you might buy you might not what if

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,990
you forgot something for example what if

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,330
I want to import or do the dependency

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:58,660
injection on HTTP can i what would you

00:04:53,330 --> 00:05:02,840
do at first you are you are you are

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,090
standing in a component and I want to

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:13,400
educate beacon I object what would you

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:15,669
do at first you need to importer HTTP

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,490
client module is that correct

00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:22,610
you didn't need to do that first then

00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:26,150
you you need to open the angular module

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,639
and you import that then you do the DI

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,400
in the constructor of a component is

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,610
that correct so that's the concept so we

00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,240
know the concept but we eliminate all of

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,889
the the needed a typing when you do the

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,969
development I wish I will show you

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:46,550
something later so what is control of

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:48,710
lost a what I mean is eliminate all the

00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:52,400
destruction from your mind so if

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,580
anything were destruction for your

00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:00,770
angered abandonment you should enumerate

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:04,750
it by some tool or some course centipede

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:08,210
or something else I will show you okay

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:11,120
then we are talking about English see

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,219
right I think it everyone of you

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,710
understand what is anger see right right

00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:18,500
there are many tools and there are many

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:23,419
features so this page can really

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:26,210
understand all the comments you can

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,909
create a new project right everybody use

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:32,840
that then you can generate component

00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,560
okay you can do the upgrade you all know

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,039
that right

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,790
you can ng add you know in the ng ed

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,400
right you can add you and your

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,310
almost anything you can add material

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,250
angular elements PTA or something else

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:51,390
there are lots of maybe thousands

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:53,250
oh no no no thousand hundreds right and

00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,950
a you you can build your own

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,580
cogeneration that's that's very

00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,000
important and this is very very useful

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,240
so in my company I usually I use

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,010
schematics a lot we do the cogeneration

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:14,520
for any of the repeated tasks so we

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:17,880
write a lot of schematics so we do some

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,210
extension to exist in English your I and

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,520
we do our own schematics that's it so

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,690
let me show you something there's a very

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,770
good sample tutorial forensic Murphy he

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:36,270
buta anger see IUD does anyone of you

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:46,680
know this project yes okay so this is a

00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:49,550
very good example to show so this is a

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,550
simple project

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:08,690
so this is a simple project on clones

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:12,880
from the lucky hub repository then what

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:18,530
if there's a project of the year I

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,950
probably want to stop lists and studies

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,950
project

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:38,469
so this is a simple project what if I

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,719
want to make a new CI UD features if I

00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:43,419
want to use less kinetics you can write

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,280
some extension and that project or use

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,280
your own then

00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:06,580
okay let me start his project as you can

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:12,730
see this page let me show you some

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:17,010
screen here this is the github

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:21,340
repository for this project you can

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,730
simply clone project and this tutorial

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:29,440
over here so you do the clone first into

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:34,360
the amp install then you create a model

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:38,560
definition file over here okay then I

00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,050
want to try something this is the simple

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,950
project I want to create your brother

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,260
first that's it and then I want to

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:53,650
create a model definition file

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:57,910
it's a JSON file then I create this

00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,850
model as you can see this is the

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,220
customized version of Jason definition

00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,860
so you have title and the T or something

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,650
else so any of the definition you can

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:16,900
change you can customize okay after you

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:20,170
have this one then we can do the ng

00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:23,190
generate as you can see this come in

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:26,950
this is ng generate a customized

00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:30,010
schematics then you tell then what's

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,860
little further then enter so liske

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,230
schematics will read the model that JSON

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:40,180
file and create all the needed

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:43,270
components for example over here see

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,650
this is hotel right I just create one

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:50,050
file and all the others including

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:53,050
services routes or modules on components

00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,280
are generated automatically there are

00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:01,470
right then

00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:04,570
I mean Charla page okay so you see

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:09,330
there's a whole there's a fly and we

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,330
create a hotel right so hotel

00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:24,110
then done this is the full future see

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:28,839
IUD for a hotel is that cool so that's

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:31,879
what I want to represent to you about

00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:40,459
productivity improvement for the angular

00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:42,290
development okay so you have engineer

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:45,350
and G ad and G generate and you're wrong

00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:51,499
you have many else many anything else

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:55,550
you can do for example how many of you

00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:58,249
are using material ok nice so you must

00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:02,329
know and you add material right so you

00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:08,720
can do all the fundamental stuff about

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:13,610
building your your your material and the

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,480
scamander's contains a interactive way

00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:21,860
to do the basic configure mint

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:26,329
configuration the other one is useful in

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,970
case your I to do Lea angular apps

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:31,279
update so keep your angular apps

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:35,449
evergreen which means you can upgrade

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:40,550
your anger apps to the latest version

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:43,420
always are you doing that how many of

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:49,550
you are using anger 6 and below

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:51,600
no one nice actually I use an angular

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,199
from angular 1

00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:10,600
uh-oh that's my daughter

00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:15,579
sorry okay so how many of you already

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,680
upgrade to angular night IV you try that

00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:25,769
before

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:25,769
yeah nice is that smooth upgrade yeah

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,540
yes always always the party libraries

00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,430
exactly

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:40,810
okay then I want to show you some cool

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:43,389
things about vs code so this is probably

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:47,019
not the best angular development tool

00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:50,279
but probably let the top two a top three

00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:54,430
okay so I want to show you something I

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:57,220
use very a lot the first one is called

00:13:54,430 --> 00:14:05,170
could navigation how many of you are

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:06,269
using the expo ler a lot raise your hand

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,350
please

00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:16,019
okay listen to me turn it off no more

00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:20,079
exposure okay contra be turn off okay

00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:22,860
then you can see this is the simple

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:26,319
project I want to demo today this is a

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,639
just a simple page simple page and there

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:34,680
are some charts oh there are some bugs

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,680
no chart what if I reloaded

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,890
oh.nothing display right it because it's

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:49,650
jQuery braised grave so this is not

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,380
showing I want to fix that so and less

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,140
than in this moment I want to debug I

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,560
want to modify some code what sure you

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,080
do you want to open that component is

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,650
that right what would you do use the

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,700
spoiler

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:10,440
now forget it search it okay this is

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:14,330
this path over here it's a chart and

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:19,610
flawed so I know this component probably

00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:26,880
have a pure flood so I hit control E and

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:29,580
the flood and enter done and if I want

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:39,390
to switch to the template page what

00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:44,280
would you do now oh oh yeah oh and auto

00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:48,600
switch back very quick so if you open up

00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:51,540
the Explorer that is a distraction for

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,930
your development so remember some of the

00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,920
key keyboard shortcut is very important

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,700
okay

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:04,530
so just turn it off and Auto clicks

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:09,150
which are very good and codification

00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:10,770
have some other features ctrl e contains

00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,950
fuzzy matching fuzzy matching is very

00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,440
very good even if you tap the wrong key

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,020
were you can find the right file it's

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,350
very cool and you can quickly navigate

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,460
back and forth by this keyword so you

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,130
can aught left author right you can

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,100
quickly navigate between what you just

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,610
opened the location so this is very good

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:41,250
and the other one is bring him how many

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,380
of you are using I bring you before very

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:48,810
few people know that let me show you

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:52,230
okay so as you as you may know this this

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:55,080
page is charts flower right so you you

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:58,290
say in your mind that you issue probably

00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:01,140
think this is there's a chart module and

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:03,870
the flock component so what if I want to

00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:07,199
open some component that inside the

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,709
chart module but different component so

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,670
you can try this C ctrl shift a dot

00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:17,220
control shift a dot you get this then

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,339
you use your arrow key to quickly

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:25,670
navigate the component or you can use

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,670
the control left key to go to the parent

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:34,080
right and the control left go to the

00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:38,520
parent okay when you find the right file

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:49,260
just hit enter you open the file pretty

00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:52,260
cool right sure I I always don't like

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:57,660
side-by-side comparison because in my

00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:00,900
mind I need to focus if I I'm writing

00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,740
code or debugging for one component in

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,960
my might only one component no - so

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,680
that's the most efficient way to do the

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,680
angular development

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:21,080
yeah you can you have dual monitor right

00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,560
so you're getting well then as many as

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,370
you want

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:28,010
yeah so if you want to reference some

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,420
other component but this very few chance

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,230
to do that for me

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,640
for me so I always like to focus on one

00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,700
component okay

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,120
and if you want to quickly navigate

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,680
between files I will remember some of

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,420
the key shortcuts for example after if

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:52,660
you know that right go to definition

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:56,470
this is very important how to go back

00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:00,380
arrow and left Oh No Auto key and left

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:02,170
then you go back and go first all right

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:06,620
that's it

00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:09,080
so and it's any time you want to do

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:13,550
something you have a concept then you

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:16,330
focus and the you agree if you remember

00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:20,000
some of the very useful keep a shortcut

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:25,130
that's that's very same time and also

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,240
without any destruction okay okay let me

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:32,030
fix the problem of this so this one is

00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,130
oh no not this one there's a flaw

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,390
component and a laser and you only need

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:41,180
there's nothing there so I want to fix

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:45,970
the thing that the problem for example

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:51,190
ctrl e and open the index.html and

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:54,230
there's a flood fire up there okay and

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:57,560
all the data all the jQuery initialized

00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:02,150
file over here so I'm calm I'm going to

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:07,510
control / / to come in this and the safe

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:12,170
and control a flood data open it and

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,430
uncontrol a to do the copy and go back

00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:17,930
to the flock Impala

00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:21,260
what would you do night right now what

00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:26,000
left right

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:28,130
left left left left left dan so let's

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,900
let my said that's the concept that's

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,440
the Zen of anger development I

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:36,400
understand okay then I just copy past to

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:42,730
the ng hung in it that's the necessary

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:49,100
code to do the scenes so I for me this

00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:52,130
okay what do you see there for arrow and

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:55,580
Eddy for warrants oh that's terrible

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:58,970
right this this is very obtained if you

00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:03,920
mix angular and jQuery most of the arrow

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:08,320
probably related to to type in issue so

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:13,040
so let me fix that how do we fix that

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,490
click this and click the arrow then

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,660
focus here right so this is a critical

00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,820
error the rate curve right and I want to

00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,670
fix this you can see the error message

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,160
cannot finance series so if you are

00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,860
experienced on the tab script so I think

00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:35,480
you you probably will understand how to

00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:38,630
fix that any one of you understand do

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,970
you know how to fix that yes it's a

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:49,660
global variable I will avoid that so

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:52,910
Const right so at least I'm no arrow

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:57,310
what about 82 worries I want to

00:21:52,910 --> 00:22:00,740
eliminate all of this oh you can see

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:04,400
this is a just warnings but I'd like to

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:09,200
all this worrying to become zero so what

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:13,370
would you do for me I will use less or

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:20,060
section or quick action which is this

00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:25,490
one okay so fix actually you can show

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:27,650
fix over here or just here this is the

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,770
new feature may be free few months ago

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:34,700
okay you can just hit this and control

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:37,909
that fix all fixed

00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:42,230
oh testing feature feed barriers then

00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:46,330
enter so any two to two 22 right now

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:51,129
then next one okay this is a outdated

00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:55,159
API usage so I have to remove this

00:22:51,129 --> 00:23:02,200
manually and there are 21 arrows over

00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:02,200
here what would you do they recommend

00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:09,279
yes Const

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:14,109
so almost all arrow are related to this

00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:14,109
right so just fix everything

00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:33,489
only three only two right so triple

00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:37,519
equal last one okay outdated API done

00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:41,600
right so if you are afraid of taps crew

00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:46,460
actually there are some newbies really

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,889
afraid of type screen how about you yeah

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:52,759
I mean in my country there learn there

00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:55,399
are many newbies for fuller angular

00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:58,489
developers they are very afraid of

00:23:55,399 --> 00:24:02,359
typescript it because when they're

00:23:58,489 --> 00:24:06,470
working Co moved to the PS file they are

00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:11,720
getting lots of errors right so I fix

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:14,899
everything so you can you can see if you

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,299
really master in levears code you can

00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:22,489
really improve your productivity a lot

00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:27,769
okay and what I really I want to mention

00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:31,220
oh I want to focus is the the Zen of

00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:35,419
encode environment which means anger

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:41,600
development without destruction okay for

00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:45,619
example what if I want to import HTTP

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,440
can i I want to import anger HTTP

00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:53,960
connect module first right so I can

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:56,150
e IPP module enter then there's a HD we

00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,080
can imagine over here it's a bit already

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:06,500
been imported let me remove it and the

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:11,950
import what would you do I think many

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:15,340
many of the people are doing that right

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:25,430
no no way

00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:27,980
try this right what about if if you want

00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,880
to import re-edit phones module what

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:34,870
would you do in your mind you were

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,850
singing about some keyword the first one

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,520
must be important right the second one

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:48,080
could be reacting phones right so

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:53,720
reactive phones over here right so if

00:25:48,080 --> 00:26:04,640
you remember all these these even these

00:25:53,720 --> 00:26:07,850
are distractions right so let me

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:14,330
introduce 1 vs Co extension angular

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:18,380
extension pack I made it how many how

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:24,260
many of you been install this one none

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:26,630
odd - oh yeah

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:35,770
Chapas energy has been included in my

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:39,950
station back and and actually they are

00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:42,530
there are two identical naming of the

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:49,310
angular impact one is here one's here

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:51,570
all right please remember is da mine so

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:55,770
in my extension page they contain

00:26:51,570 --> 00:27:04,530
and probably 20 more extension related

00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:08,430
iterating your development yeah oh yeah

00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:10,620
probably yes maybe but this is really

00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:19,190
save you time when you do the angular

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:19,190
dependence what me no sorry

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:29,220
yes I think so yes

00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:32,580
okay so in my extension pack layer

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:37,020
contains lots of feature tools and the

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,710
features extend to your risco so angular

00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,480
language service this is a mass install

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:45,420
extension right everyone should be

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,550
installed that in your language service

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,460
extension because leaks extension

00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:53,100
includes our cosmetic and they can

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:55,350
understand your code look until syntax

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,790
highlight and the latest version of

00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:02,570
angular language service can understand

00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:06,810
more of your call you can do the

00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:09,240
refactoring of your code and you can

00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:14,640
quickly streets switch between files in

00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:17,940
a component oh or shift auto for Mac OS

00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,790
and you can switch to CSS very quickly

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,210
or to I or you can switch to the the

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:26,040
taps crew files or something else or

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:29,580
respect file if you write in unit

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,920
testing code and there are lots of you

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,320
constantly is I just a more the some of

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,770
the cosna Pete I made that is and you

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:43,340
import you don't have to really remember

00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:48,120
ng part you know just type import reate

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:52,230
cap then right then there are lots of

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:56,310
others needs probably hundreds so this

00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:58,500
one is come for John Papa the extension

00:28:56,310 --> 00:29:01,530
and some others are found other

00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,280
extension so my extension is a extension

00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:08,730
pack so it wraps lots of stages

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,880
and also theists linter is very good I

00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:14,790
just sure you'll a fix all auto fixable

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,880
problem feature the function is very

00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:22,530
good and latias lint coral rules

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,930
containes 100 and more rules in your

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:28,290
teeth lint adjacent file so you can

00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:32,340
modify or customer it there there are

00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:35,370
two configuration I mentioned over here

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,790
which is very important also

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,620
but the for the current version it's

00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:44,880
been enabled by default

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:49,170
okay and also this R vs Canadian score

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,750
fixed o TS lean this is off the force by

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:54,540
default you can turn it on by this

00:29:51,750 --> 00:30:00,390
configuration so every time when you

00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:04,800
save a file or other all the fixable

00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:06,990
failure will be auto fix did and there

00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,750
are lots of tap screen refactoring

00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,150
torrents that your vs code if you

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:18,240
install it in your extension pack let me

00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:20,700
show you something okay as you can see

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:26,130
the flock component over here they are

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:28,350
more than 1000 nice this is really too

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:33,060
big so I want to do some refactoring

00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:36,000
what would you do I will find some and

00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:41,130
young in it so I probably will use the

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:46,670
bring jump feature and turn out right

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:46,670
then go to here then there's our

00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:57,780
function call back here okay so what I

00:30:51,930 --> 00:31:01,110
wanted to do is select the range almost

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:07,740
every code inside and G only need select

00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:09,930
then control dot then I will choose this

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:14,040
one it's ready to function in major

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:17,730
scope okay then

00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:23,370
Irene and it float in it

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:29,810
- okay lots refactoring right then I go

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:33,810
to this one control that no nothing

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:39,600
control that then there's a feature of

00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:47,040
here move the new file done an auto

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:54,210
imported right so it's becoming only 90

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:56,910
nice ok safe okay just safe and I want

00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,450
to show you something more he's over

00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,560
here

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:05,700
so probably you don't want this fire

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:08,580
over here you want to put some out some

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:16,080
other places for example if you want to

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:18,230
move to charts shared ok what would you

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,230
do

00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:27,470
drag-and-drop right try it oh no over

00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:42,110
here

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:42,110
okay drop wait for 5 seconds oh come on

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:54,159
oh come on issue working oh yeah yeah

00:32:51,370 --> 00:33:01,299
it's working is that cool

00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:05,440
this is the feature not building envious

00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:08,499
Cove it's building in the visco

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,350
extension code move TS you must install

00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:11,889
that extension but you can forget about

00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,009
it

00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:26,720
just install mine I include everything

00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:30,119

[Laughter]

00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:34,539
okay

00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:36,429
and then there are some other very

00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:38,350
useful extensions for example changing

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:42,490
to tears how many of you has been used

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:44,860

oh alright I don't have money to buy web

00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:57,600
stone how many of you are using webstorm

00:33:55,259 --> 00:34:05,080
Wow

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:07,720
okay okay okay okay so you can easily to

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,490
transform your JSON file into a type

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,220
screed definition interface

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:19,139
this is very useful let me show you

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:23,530
something so Jason example okay I

00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:27,609
randomly choose any jason definition so

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:31,899
you can just assume this JSON format is

00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:44,040
comes from european web api then you can

00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:52,080
create some thought yes

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:58,500
okay then f1 passed

00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:01,300
Jason as coal or paste Jason as type

00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,830
these two are different this will

00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,869
generate class lives with general

00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:13,210
interface okay it's different

00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:18,540
oh sorry again and you you have to

00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,540
define a top-level type name just some

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:27,730
strong type right it's very useful very

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:32,470
useful so this video has to be has been

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:59,109
building your web stone right oh okay

00:35:32,470 --> 00:36:01,720
is that free yes ok I see cool okay

00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:05,650
then there's an extension cord document

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:11,020
list so you can do the the comment very

00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:12,330
easy by hit the ctrl T twice there's an

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:24,220
example of here

00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:29,710
ctrl or D twice oh oh oh oh now this is

00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:31,950
the that I should turn it off ok try

00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,950
again

00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:43,690
all right yeah this shortcut has been

00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:49,780
replaced by some other extensions is not

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:52,990
too much extension I think do you know

00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:58,230
