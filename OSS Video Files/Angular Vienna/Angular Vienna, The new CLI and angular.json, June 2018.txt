Description: 
	Talk by David Müllerchen

Once when the Angular team introduces the CLI everyone was amazed by it's feature set. Now, about two years later, there are a couple of changes and improvements. Now we are able to scaffold a library, add features and update our Angular project automatically. I want to show you how these awesome new features work and which possibilities are available. Curious? I am. Can't wait to meet you.

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:34,040
want to talk about the angular CLI and

00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:35,579
yeah and the new features first of all

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:41,010
yeah that's me

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:49,230
over time almost every every Network I'm

a kid I'm a freelancer and consultant

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,300
I'm doing JavaScript development since I

00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,710
guess more than 15 years

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,890
so when jQuery was coming out I was

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:05,549
there and I was and everywhere everyone

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,510
says nay don't do this JavaScript stuff

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:14,580
this will never get to some serious

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:18,990
stuff like Java and I'm out of the duct

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:23,540
so I tried to to get into Java and it

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:26,909
didn't work so now I have to stay in

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,770
into JavaScript yeah I have a blog web

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,409
dev t.i right about right about

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,659
everything I faced in the during

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:43,009
development or angular yeah

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:46,979
and I'm on github so maybe if you want

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:50,430
after the talk my the source code will

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:52,159
be there and of course I'm at Twitter

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,960
because if it's not happen on Twitter

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,610
its don't happen anymore

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,210
never yeah this is community rocks is a

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,200
very important sentence for me because

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,000
one of the organizer of the angular

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,229
Hamburg media yeah

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,240
and I'm also a team member of angularjs

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:17,730
de so it's the angler

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:23,070
in the community in the german-speaking

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:27,330
area and yeah we are we have members

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:31,440
also here in Vienna and I'm a Google

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,230
developer expert this is a yeah they

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,960
note me and said hey come join us

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,310
Google never expect is a special program

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,460
where you can't go there and say okay

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,750
how many should I pay to get one they

00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,230
came to us way okay

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,330
join us are you interested and they have

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,180
some special requirements to get in

00:02:51,330 --> 00:03:00,800
there so you have to have to know

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:06,120
something about programming and it's not

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,790
important thing about his the most

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,520
important thing is you have to be

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:14,130
interactive with the community yeah you

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,990
have to give them something so the

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:20,250
Google developer experts are maybe

00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,530
something like the interface between the

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,170
core team and develop a sum like this

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:34,860
yeah so you can reach out to us and we

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:39,990
have offer help for free or paid for

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:48,560
sure and we can connect you to the core

00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:51,690
team but very important I was I was I

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,670
one week later I had in Hamburg I had

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,560

and he announced me in front of my

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,200
community as Google Beresford and yeah

00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,169
of course they follow me on Twitter so

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,750
one or other of them knew it already but

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,710
yeah it was very hunch Hagee after that

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,690
and and now it's

00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,880
I'm very proud to announce that I'm not

00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:39,889
the only angle at Google you expert in

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:43,220
this room because this guy here this guy

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:45,530

ago four weeks three weeks some like

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:51,410
this so the the Google team or the

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:56,210
Google developer team noticed him and

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:59,630
his effort for the community and he made

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:03,350
all the steps for the interviewing steps

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:06,860
and no he is one so we have to drink a

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:12,620
beer or two or five or six twelve to get

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,460
after this okay okay um short thing

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,979
about my slides

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,240
they are very technical very

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:23,840
non-technical of course and I'm not the

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,130
only one who was working on these slides

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:34,360
because I have kids

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:38,090
it's more than one and it's a skit and

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:41,930
they are very into legal yeah you know

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:43,639
legal this plastic bricks and stick it

00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,800
together and make your movie into stuff

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,510
and I came to them answer okay I have

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,580
this idea and I need this this this and

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,419
this money and they came up and say okay

00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:03,830
but let's do this and and they helped me

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:10,159
a lot so 75% of the slides are by them

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:13,729
done okay so if you like them I have to

00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:20,060

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:27,229
in the city

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,909
these two guys this is Mary it's very

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:32,570
important that you get to know the names

00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:34,159

Peter

00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,330
he's the HR manager just wasn't a joke

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:50,540
it's coming okay

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:53,530
and and they just underway in to lunch

00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:57,590
time to get some lunch in the break and

00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:00,710
Peter just had a interview with a

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:03,350
candidate and they are talking about

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,690
this this can yet Paul this is a joke

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:11,870
Paul Peter Paul Mary Peter Paul and Mary

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:15,020
okay we are too young to all bad jokes i

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,000
audio I told ya

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,090
Paul is very skilled and he can set up

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,510
projects angular project in seconds and

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:28,820
he okay that's fast but what about the

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:32,140
environment it's included who you are

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:39,340
using the English Eli raise your hands

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:39,340
almost everywhere everyone I twice so

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:46,340
but did he follow the style guide it's

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,540
very important question because if you

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:53,900
have very messy code it's not very funny

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:59,660
to maintain it right right

00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:02,240
thank you sure and he even write chests

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,640

air I answer oh thank you thank you

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:16,100
no that sounds great but at the end only

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,990
five size matters right so we don't want

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,040
to ship gigabytes to the to the so we

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:25,310
want to ship some bytes and yeah of

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,130
course he knows what how to TN tree

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,800

and he says okay we should hire him so

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,700
he can teach us oh wait yes so she is

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,110

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:58,279
he's getting we are very excited about

00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:02,480
it and and how can he manage all this

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:06,910
and he was the epic tool called angular

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:11,000
CLI and she is Wow

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:15,350
what how how it's very easy

00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,420
yeah it's just it's it's very very easy

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:23,720
to do first of all you have to install

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:27,430
it right NPM install NPM install at this

00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:34,190
point I have to mention please notice

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:39,470
this all okay this one yeah I don't know

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:43,070
why my kid says then a with mg knew the

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:45,680
name and some additional parameters you

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:51,200
can kick off or scaffold the project and

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:55,450
you knew yeah this one and then you see

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,070
the into this project like he does and

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:01,940
then just and you surf and you can start

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:08,500
developing yeah so like this shark man

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:12,110
does just four steps I did them so um I

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,920
jump over to the demo whatever demo

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:20,600
means I have this kicked off this

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,720
project I just did MPM Angie knew how

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:28,520
it's called CLI team oh yeah you can see

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:33,410
and then it's got for me the project we

00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,350
have here yeah a small project with the

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,640
facts the ball check its itself the main

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:42,860
project is living in this app folder and

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:47,000
then there is a config file called

00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:50,180
angular Jason this is for just on

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,490
configs for this the fight for the CLI

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:58,220
to to help us to do some tasks so you

00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,910
said we can just say and she surf then

00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,190
let's try it

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:07,779
yeah right and G

00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:11,610
I installed it yesterday so it worked

00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:16,589
yesterday I hope it will work today also

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:20,230
yeah when we take a look into the

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:23,410
angular JS and then we see that we have

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,990
here's something with called schematics

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,019
who of you know what schematics are you

00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:33,029
are you know men fish tires or maybe you

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:36,430
know his book yes I was yeah yeah yeah

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:41,170
schematics are the heart of the English

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:43,750
I so you just say generate foo and he

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,759
goes to a folder in the schematics which

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,829
says foo and their says ok if you means

00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,620
you have to set up this and this and

00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:55,000
this can add this code name it so hang

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:58,029
it there for introduces there provided a

00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,569
or whatever so it's just copy blueprint

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:05,110
and generate code from it that's a short

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:07,680
form yeah Manfred wrote a book about it

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:15,180
so it's not that short but almost it

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:19,660
then we have we have a project this is

00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:22,750
we it's all projects it's plural yeah so

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:26,290
we can have more than one project in in

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,720
the C live project more than one angular

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,500
project so it would CLI we can generate

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,850
angular applications or libraries so we

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,850
could for example could generate project

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,160
and then generate libraries for for

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,980
example something like a date picker or

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:50,110
a slider however it came to my mind no

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:53,319
and and you will find them here just say

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,529
ng generate project in the name and then

00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:59,620
generated here I generated the C live

00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:03,610
demo and on for every project there will

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:07,509
be a generated two projects it's strange

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,939
no it isn't because it's the project

00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:10,509
itself and it's the end-to-end testing

00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:13,660
project

00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:16,160
it's just configuration how what should

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:21,350
I do when you say please and

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,540
yeah integration tests I want to focus

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:28,339
on this you see that the standard

00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:32,630
project here is the prefix they are

00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:35,269
prefixes just how is the other the text

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,699
prefix so that you can't don't get into

00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:41,240
mess with some name conflicts with other

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:44,540
projects nothing else and the project

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:50,149
chart as I said yeah you can put here

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,860
applications or just library right so I

00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:53,449
highly recommend at this point the

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,779
visual studio code because I love it

00:13:53,449 --> 00:14:02,000
it has me so much now maybe you know

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:06,250
angular components yeah we saw just some

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,440
of them in in the for the previous talk

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,860
you can configure component static says

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,230
okay I want to use a specific change

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,420
detection if you don't know what change

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,870
is taking is maybe you shouldn't come to

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:28,189
me or to Michael and come to us to our

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:32,980
workshops what we can talk about this

00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:36,800
and yeah there are two strategies and

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:41,540
this is the thing you have to set up in

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:45,139
a component so there is a manual way to

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:50,180
go into the component oh then you say

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:56,240
this is exciting says change detection

00:14:50,180 --> 00:15:00,319
abana saying write change yeah Chuck I

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,980
am folks I have to mention I'm very good

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:06,079
in in typos yeah so my Twitter handle it

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,449
looks like I can't fly but I can make

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,790
typos every time if you wake up me up in

00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:15,310
the night midnight I don't know when I

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:15,310
can do a type of change

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:24,690
so I just said I love this Eli and then

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:27,339
it's a up and leave me alone okay

00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:31,360
yeah you can you can set up the this

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:34,149
command or this this this parameter

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,540
which check check you wanna use in the

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:40,180
component you can do it manually but you

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,980
can also say okay I want to have all my

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:47,319
components with one specific strategy so

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,720
this is a it could be a XO task so if

00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:53,740
you are have enough time and want to get

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,620
paid for too much work or do stuff which

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:00,149
isn't very needed then you can do it

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:04,060
manually but you also can see could say

00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:06,519
let's go to schematics schematics I said

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,610
schematics are the heart of the CLI so

00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:11,829
rename if we say okay four components

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,930
example there are a schematic which says

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,740
if you want to generate the component

00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,529
then we want to use this test so you can

00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,079
set configurations for the for the

00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:26,350
schematics and for the components that

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,589
means we could say we want to set the

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:35,019
angular component schematics and here we

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:38,920
want to say change detection point here

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:43,810
we could choose which one thank you -

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:47,649
the wheels code is a on push that means

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,120
now every component I generate now from

00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,500
now will get the change detection

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,990
approach you say uh-huh it's nice that

00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:00,300
you say I don't believe you okay let's

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:04,299
generate one ng generate component named

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:09,760
component thank you I was expecting

00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:11,289
exactly this n gga

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:17,260
the next one will be power and pass

00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:20,260
whatever so um my machine is going slow

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,309
when I have this screen recordings oh it

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:28,120
changed the folder food somewhere here

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:30,340
and my component in there and when I

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,630
click on it then it says a change

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,350
detection to say

00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,470
years on Porsche awesome

00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:43,990
there are many many options that I could

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:47,500
set in the for my four components if you

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,710
use a smart IDE or a smart editor like

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:55,150
wheels to the code then you can just

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:58,990
store a long as SVR ye space and you

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:03,640
will have you so for example if you want

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,980
to change if you are building a library

00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,500
then you want to export your components

00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,950
that the consumer of your Lobby can use

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,920
it so then you can set export of for

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:18,640
true or a flat or whatever or you can

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,890
set even the view encapsulation it means

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,510
I want to show I want to use for example

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:30,700
the shadow Dom or I want to use none

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:35,830
which is also a valid approach but I

00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:39,820
want to go native so and this is for

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:41,950
sure I'm doable for for everything like

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:47,680
which we can generate like a class a

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:51,400
directive pipe or even for a service so

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:56,970
that's it we can set configuration for

00:18:51,400 --> 00:19:02,110
some stuff we want to generate a very

00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,850
often problem in in in project is it's

00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:07,660
no it's not a problem but it's it's a

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:11,650
it's a possible failure or it's it's a

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:14,020
point where you can fail it's not a good

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:19,930
idea to test against the production

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:22,330
system right yeah thank you and and so

00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:25,180
do you have something like a def system

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:29,020
where you are going through you have

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:31,900
maybe something like like a alpha stage

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,150
or something like this where you build

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,900
it and then it goes to the QA whatever

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,610
and I I was in a project and every time

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,000
when we build it and shipped it to the

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,710
server

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,760
then we get a call from the from the

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:48,950
from the admin from the the guy who that

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,470
was a special guy was I was only job was

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:54,590
to pick a file folder and put it to the

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:59,120
web stores and he called us that it

00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:01,040
doesn't works and then me every time the

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,280
guy who spoke girls there and says ok I

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:08,410
it was the wrong idea wrong we are from

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:11,480
the database or from the whatever

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,460
identification service whatever so the

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,730
end point of the rest service was the

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:21,200
wrong one we can configure it in the a

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:23,140
CLI we can configure it and there are

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,790
something like something called

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:30,320
configurations yeah there is a

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:37,310
configuration called production and we

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:39,560
can set all configurations like test

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,980
would you do you want to go test no no

00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:47,470
test

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:53,170
let's do yes bar so mind-blowing names

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:56,810
and in this yeah :

00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:00,640
give me your : and in there we can

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:04,400
generate replacements five replacement

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:09,560
five replacements that means we can say

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:12,320
ok in our when we if we are built for a

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,950
specific configuration for basic

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:19,850
specific stage like production or alpha

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,430
or whatever then we can please use this

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,430
file or this file we could also replace

00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,920
services you could say ok if we want to

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,560
go to the production then we want to use

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,210
production service alternate occation

00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:38,090
service if we go if you are on local

00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,400
then we use the local servers and in I

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,240
far you guess it

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:50,270
I for service it sounds weird I for

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,360
service so it's just replace thank you

00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:57,390
for this

00:21:51,360 --> 00:22:03,830
and string to the to the fire which we

00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:03,830
want to replace yeah like I take this I

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:15,900
know like this and we said okay I don't

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,960
want to go the environment from the

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:24,930
protection for amber I want to use BA

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:26,640
the ability to decode is not on any CLA

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,530
also it's not that smart that he said

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,260
okay you want to replace this

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,510
environment fire was bar then it don't

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,490
generate for you this in Maya files you

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:38,340
have to do it by your own so then you

00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:42,960
have to go to to the environment or

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:46,410
follow and there are two files in it

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,160
production and environment environment

00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:53,340
is to fire you every time refer yeah

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:56,790
because it's gets replaced but what's

00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:02,130
the right with the same name so I can

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:07,620
say I'm like this so I got in typo I

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:13,040
said so I copied in stuff and say dot GS

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:20,400
and I want to go to bar right so but and

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:24,230
then I have to copy this and put it in

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,270
there you have to be sure that every

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:29,040
stuff you would define in your in one of

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:32,730
these environments you have to define

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:36,150
any other because then you try to put

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:42,380
get some or import stuff from a which it

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:48,110
doesn't exist so what can I do with this

00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:52,080
stuff for example I could say I want to

00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:57,810
set the URL to my back-end right it's

00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:01,430
not that good to see in this case we

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,960
could say let's define a color because

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,379
colors are beautiful

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:12,809
I love this green beautiful green okay

00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:16,610
um I have to export color this was pop

00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:22,350
ha bright export are you noticed

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:29,580
constant color and then I say I want to

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:30,889
know what it is color red because red is

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,509
ugly Cara

00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:40,889
and then I can't go to this one and say

00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:45,690
yeah I want to use green because green

00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:59,070
is also ugly color and the third color

00:24:45,690 --> 00:25:04,919
is magenta I have a typo oh yeah what's

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:08,549
just for you so what can we how can me a

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:11,369
check if the environment is picked up

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:16,259
let's check if my surf is working yes

00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:19,649
yeah it means we can go here and kick up

00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:24,509
the server egg or the browser and say

00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:28,980
hello is it you and browser says yes I

00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:31,649
mean yeah is that hello app now let's go

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:36,019
here and say I'm I want I need I define

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:42,539
a variable here and name it colour and I

00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:46,110
want to have color and still I am says

00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:48,029
to me hey there are a color environment

00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,610
and there's a color in production and

00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:53,460
there's a color in bar as I said I want

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,350
to every time I want to get from the

00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,669
environment I want to get it from the

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,529
environment and not from a specific

00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:06,169
government because it's replaced so then

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:12,490
let's use it here let's do some very

00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:18,580
ugly stuff like not full not in full

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:22,210
I had put it here right yeah okay um

00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:25,480
yeah I was just confused by myself I can

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:33,100
this also very good let's define a style

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:35,550
da da da this is the template syntax you

00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,110
know maybe from the template or from the

00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:41,650
custom components so it's nothing new

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:45,400
nothing special color that's too L

00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:49,860
because it's so nice color so this means

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:54,250
now we just said ng serve then it tooks

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,020
no replacement and we should say you see

00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:00,640
that it almost getting red the ugly

00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:05,830
color if we now say okay let's choose

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:11,400
the other replacements yeah then we have

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:15,820
to give it to them and say okay - C

00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:20,700
configuration because it says here in

00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:23,320
the angular JS we want to use

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:28,540
configuration this one configuration and

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:32,200
production or bar yeah so we say and say

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,850
bar and now let's check if it works

00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:45,010
what do you think - does it works yeah

00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:48,040
no it doesn't so we just set up two

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:52,059
configurations but we didn't say this

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,309
Eli hey please use this configuration we

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:57,210
have to set it here every time we're

00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:01,059
looking for it I have to search for it

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:06,940
this one there is this one we have to

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:12,000
set for the surf yeah surf have to we

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:14,880
have to sell it here auto so then let's

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,740
[Music]

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,010
say bar

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:24,919
no typo everything is fine and now we

00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:29,529
have to restart his and say please use

00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:34,809
bar and what color was bar bar was

00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:37,970
magenta the ugly color from Germany and

00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:49,370
we are waiting for our we have to return

00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:54,049
right everything is saved yes everything

00:28:49,370 --> 00:29:03,470
is saved and this one is waiting for

00:28:54,049 --> 00:29:08,929
something be patient I'm not good

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:11,750
impatient I have three boys I'm not good

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:19,490
okay why he's gone there this is the

00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:22,059
configuration yeah there are many many

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,220
more option India we could set up

00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,990
projects and use live of build levels in

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:32,240
a blow check and use it in in a project

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:35,899
yeah so you can go with this mono repo

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:40,279
approach which is announced by ng x ng

00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:43,669
and X and X yeah by Nawal and this is

00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:49,130
the disease approach a they implement it

00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:51,289
here the version 6 of the ring 6 of

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,289
angular which came on the Star Wars day

00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:58,059
is because I can remember this name Eddy

00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:04,460
state are very good on may the force be

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:08,649
with you no one answer and so it's

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,649
working oh yeah no magenta is magenta

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:16,100
this was this was a release the angular

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,570
6 release was a release which was mostly

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,000
for the CLI

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:23,990
it looks like this no it wasn't but it

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,510
was there was very few changes in the in

00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:29,059
the API and in the core of angular most

00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:31,230
of them boss shipped was based on the on

00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:34,169
the CI and on the process

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:36,419
on the chamber changing from cooling

00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:40,790
chain from for the angular development

00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:43,620
so the CLI is completely different now

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:45,929
not completely but the configuration is

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,720
different from there these the the

00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:53,820
schematics landed almost everywhere and

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:59,549
we got some very nice new commands in

00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:01,650
the in the CLI which are we could add we

00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:04,320
could add functionality we can say hey I

00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:10,380
have a angular come application and I

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:19,770
want to add angular material delete and

00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:25,980
I prepared something like this and is it

00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:28,620
that just say ok I want to add angular

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:32,250
material then he makes an NPM install

00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:35,070
and make some and looks into the angular

00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:38,070
material schematic find some results

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,990
what to do and says oh wait we have to

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:45,360
update this and isn't this and we have

00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:51,570
to change something and import stuff

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:58,919
they are answer and this is take some

00:31:51,570 --> 00:32:02,160
time this also brings new new

00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,200
functionality to CLI itself so after we

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,590
added new functionality you see it's

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,010
open

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:11,669
it's able for example if you add angular

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,669
elements it's able to generate custom

00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:17,429
elements for example if you add the

00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:22,440
angular service worker

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:25,260
it's or a PWA it's able to generate all

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,429
the service worker and a manifest file

00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,130
and check to the router and put it in

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:36,419
the service worker configuration stuff

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:41,040
it's all by the matching thank you for

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:43,650
this speed after we edited we can

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,120
generate angular material stuff so which

00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,670
we don't say anymore

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,950
we don't restrict it to the standard

00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,190
stuff we want to generate we can and now

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:57,480
generate hey angular material navigation

00:32:53,190 --> 00:33:05,160
and give it a name and I'm waiting for

00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:20,000
my process or I skip it because I'm

00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:20,000
prepared and I say I just have to what

00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:35,670
edgy this one that means that I have to

00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:39,230
we kick this one and I have edited -

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:42,210
yeah I run these three commands I added

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:50,640
navigation and a dashboard and now my

00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:55,050
application looks like this after it's

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:58,490
kicked up magically it's add new

00:33:55,050 --> 00:34:00,929
functionality and imported the new

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,470
components from the English material and

00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:06,900
then I can use it out of the box and I

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:14,330
don't have to write code for this so

00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:14,330
it's magic when it works oh come on

00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:26,720
how's the weather in Vienna what we're

00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:31,370
saying is we're not going to win the

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:37,659
World Championship in football I just

00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:46,280
want to wait some time okay that's mg T

00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:52,429
and G okay as I guess my ram is going

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:54,649
into my OBS another very cool feature of

00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,530
the angular CLI after the update is and

00:34:54,649 --> 00:35:01,510
after the aptitude angular 6 is that you

00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:08,030
are able to update angular projects from

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:11,750
2 to 3 2 to 4 4 to 5 5 to 6 and there's

00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:16,280
an update guide online which is and you

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:18,410
can find on the URL update dot angular

00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,980
thought I oh yeah you say this is my

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:24,380
current version of angular and this is

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,270
my my target version and what should I

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,400
do and then it says gives you a very

00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:30,410
nice to-do list where you can check the

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,440
boxes that yeah I did I did at it and at

00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:38,030
the end you have upgraded version they

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:41,810
are discussing about this for updating

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:45,710
English as2 angular but they at the

00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:54,490
moment they just discussing ok so don't

00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:57,490
panic and this one oh come on this is

00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:57,490
yeah

00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:16,990
yeah I'm waiting for my former process

00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:19,540
and yeah what at Colossae if you are

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:24,340
curious about the new features in EULA

00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:27,820
then you maybe would love to read the

00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:30,220
block of steam flowing which you can

00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,770
find the blog post about the new angular

00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:36,820
features you can find it on block dot

00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:40,320
angular dot IO and yeah he says which is

00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:43,600
all the new features you if you are

00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:48,820
maintaining or thinking about creating a

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:55,119
library maybe you should think about it

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:58,450
to go with the schematics approach to to

00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:02,670
offer you the user of your library the

00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:06,550
possibility to upgrade it with ng ad

00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:08,170
because if and when everyone knows that

00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,450
there is this awesome feature and yet

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,910
and you are the only libraries which

00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,980
don't use it maybe it just is not isn't

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,660
criteria why they choose not your

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,410
library and another library yeah so I

00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,800
don't want to stress

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:28,750
yeah what he used use the CI and use the

00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:31,680
schematics so I was I just had a corpus

00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:34,480
was one from the community and he was

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,670
very sad about the project where he is

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,450
in because it wasn't generated by the

00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:43,690
seal I was one of the seed project and

00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:45,369
it was angular version five so they are

00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:51,320
still seed project out there

00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:55,790
what about is AA story

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:59,840
he said because he had to all his stuff

00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:01,370
distill I do for him to the äôt and the

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,640
tree shaking he have to do by its own

00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:08,450
and all the stuff he is able to generate

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,330
stuff and trishia and not to shake and

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:14,810
lazy load stuff you have to be had to do

00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:17,180
it by its own so this is stuff yes to

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,790
maintain the web.config and all the

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,590
stuff yeah there are there are

00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:23,600
possibilities and there are ways and to

00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,650
tell us how to do but if you get some

00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,160
tooling which is maintained by a very

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:34,090
big community and a very good core team

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,940
then I would stick to this or not to a

00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:40,580
seed project which is maintained by two

00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,070
people and last it was very funny the

00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:48,350
last change last commit on this project

00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:50,840
is about right after the version 5 and

00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,900
since then nothing else so that's the

00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:59,720
reason why they can't update to energy

00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:01,790
for Ethics so this is the stuff I did

00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:06,560
see light generated for me everything I

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:12,860
had to do was ng add any generate and of

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:18,920
course the nav component and set up a

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:21,830
router to to came up with my dashboard

00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,400
component which is the dashboard you see

00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:28,989
