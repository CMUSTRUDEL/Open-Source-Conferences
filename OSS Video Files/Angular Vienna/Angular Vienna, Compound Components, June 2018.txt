Components are at the very heart of the architectural style Angular is built upon. Thus, much has already been written about this important concept, if you think of Brad Frost's Atomic Design or Dan Abramov's clustering in Dump and Smart Components. But beside those patterns for organizing components in a useful way, there are also some rather unknown but very powerful best practices to design and craft components to stay maintainable, extensible and reusable. One of these best practices is the usage of so called compound components. Originated form ReactJS and first introduced by Ryan Florence I will show you, by doing a lot of live coding, how this technique can be applied to real world Angular projects.
