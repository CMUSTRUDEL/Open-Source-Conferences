Title: Angular Vienna, Compound Components, June 2018

Description: 
	Talk by David Leitner

Components are at the very heart of the architectural style Angular is built upon. Thus, much has already been written about this important concept, if you think of Brad Frost's Atomic Design or Dan Abramov's clustering in Dump and Smart Components. But beside those patterns for organizing components in a useful way, there are also some rather unknown but very powerful best practices to design and craft components to stay maintainable, extensible and reusable. One of these best practices is the usage of so called compound components. Originated form ReactJS and first introduced by Ryan Florence I will show you, by doing a lot of live coding, how this technique can be applied to real world Angular projects.

hello can you hear me okay I cannot see

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,760
you but it's it's not a problem

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,769
well I'm David I will talk about

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,820
compound components today who has ever

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:18,800
heard about compound components Oh

00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:22,550
nobody okay maybe a little bit well

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,740
actually i will also talk about sliders

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:29,730
and maybe a little bit about yeah

00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,630
component design I would call it like

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:36,390
this so this slider I mean it has a

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,550
special history to me it was the first

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,950
slide I've ever created an angular and

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,469
it was the first component I created

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,160
back in the days in angularjs which was

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,079
reused in a company so you know normally

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,030
you create components for your project

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,969
and this was the first component which

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,430
was used and people are all started like

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,039
this I created this slider for project

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,440
and people came to me and said hey David

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,300
I've seen your slider maybe we could

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,270
reuse it for other projects and I said

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,850
of course yeah cool cool idea so I

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,439
created an NPM package put it to Nexis

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,150
and things started like to start and

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,549
this lot is will epic meaning to me

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,890
maybe it's like your first car you first

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,020
catch you first kiss I don't know but

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,090
for me it's my first slider and I

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,619
learned a lot from my first slider and I

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,670
will like to go a little bit into detail

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:32,610
and the slider itself is pretty simple I

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,740
hope you can see it okay

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,890
the slider itself is just a definition

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,020
of slide definitions and the slider it

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,450
sells takes two slides and the other

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,570
attributes and if you go to the slider

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,170
you can see okay it gets some input and

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,630
it has this interval observable and

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,450
every two seconds actually the offset is

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,820
changed and the offset is set here so we

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,140
will just change the margin top and the

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,390
transitions actually done by CSS and

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,430
that's pretty simple and people liked it

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,590
because it worked actually have people

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:11,710
people like things unity because they

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:14,480
work so raises are not that high

00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:17,260
you know when you push something to

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,540
somewhere and people start reusing it

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,030
you get a lot of people into your office

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,700
yeah because they say hey David I use a

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,620
slider pot and every time you hear but

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,010
you know that's a lot of work to do for

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,160
you

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,860
so the first advice may be never build a

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,830
reusable component in the company if you

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,080
don't get paid or if you don't get time

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,490
for maintaining it yeah and the first

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,050
part was hey David

00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,670
this light is quite cool but it's a

00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,860
little bit fast can we change the speed

00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,560
maybe and as it of course we can change

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,330
the speed it's not that not as hard

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,930
actually we have seen it already we just

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,250
met need to add a new input which is

00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:58,220
something like speed and which is a

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:02,780
number and we just say okay there's

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,520
speed here and when you go out to that

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,370
component all we have to do is you have

00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:11,540
to increase the speed so in our case

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,220
maybe four seconds and when we go back

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,290
to the slider it's still working and

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,510
it's a little bit slower yeah and if I

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,290
said cool I will push it to Nexis and

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:24,890
you can grab it and you have an slider

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,320
which is a changeable speed but you know

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,570
things involve and people start getting

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,730
other crazy ideas and I remember one day

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,239
somebody came in and said hey you know

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,920
our usability guy is crazy again and we

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,650
would like to have such little thoughts

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,300
on the slide yeah so you know this from

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,650
the internet maybe a slider with

00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,300
thoughts on that and you can click on

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:47,000
the dots and you jump to the position

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,690
and I said okay how hard can it be we

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,450
can add dots to your slider so all you

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:58,610
need to do actually is just creating an

00:03:53,450 --> 00:04:00,560
enum with none and and show so this is

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,700
the top navigation option to show the

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,470
top navigation or not and the next thing

00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,900
you have to do actually is just create a

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:14,209
div and get another input say okay we

00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,729
have top navigation options now just

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:21,169
maybe carpet you know life coding is

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:23,990
also very error-prone so we get a top

00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,220
navigation options here and this top

00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,700
navigation options actually

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,820
used here by an NG F so we just say okay

00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:36,320
if the top navigation option and I use a

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,810
tiny trick here I don't know if you know

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,000
this but you can use an enum in the in

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,560
the templates index if you just apply

00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,020
the reference to to Susan field so I

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,110
just say top navigation option is top

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,180
navigation options show if this is done

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,210
then we show some top navigation here

00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:01,190
and all we do here as we show and F is

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:03,800
ng4 so we say okay let dot off dots and

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:08,890
we give this a class which is called I

00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:14,900
don't know doc container and this one is

00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:16,490
maybe dot and we need to talk to you so

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,370
the dots am missing so we just add them

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,250
we should say okay that's a small Terra

00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:26,510
thoughts which returns an array of

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,690
numbers maybe and we just say return

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,460
this slides so slides the number of

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,640
slides we got from outside as we've

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,410
already seen slides and we map it and we

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:41,290
get a slide in the index and we just

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:46,400
return the index actually here so sorry

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:48,979
so we now show the dots actually so if

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,930
we go there okay now we don't show them

00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,090
because we have actually set the option

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:57,729
here it's just okay dot navigation

00:05:53,090 --> 00:06:00,710
option okay we do this tiny tricky again

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:04,490
and say dot navigation options it's got

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:09,830
navigation option and then we just set

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:11,090
off navigation options show okay so we

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:13,100
see the dots here and we want the

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,350
possibility to click on them so we add

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,270
this it's not a big deal either so we

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,180
just say okay we have to click Handler

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,210
and the click handler says go to slide

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,490
and it takes the actual dot and it goes

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,919
to this dot so this is slide index

00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,800
actually and when we take a look at this

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,900
interval here it actually does already

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,550
the same thing it just calculates the

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,540
current slides maybe it's better to call

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,240
it current slide ID or index

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:48,100
and this one can be reused so we just

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:52,510
call it go to slide and actually this

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,940
should already work and we just click

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,990
here and we go to the slide here okay so

00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,130
that's that's pretty neat

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:04,210
and yeah as always pushed and shipped

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,890
and you know things never end he comes

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,440
in again and says yeah you know and

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:10,570
that's a quite great but you know our

00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,970
usability guy Willa starts to become

00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,070
crazy now they want to have two dots at

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,960
the half of the slider yeah so you know

00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,790
when the sliders at the top at the

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,670
bottom of the page you want to have two

00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:24,400
slides or the dots above and I said yeah

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,650
I mean I'm a clever developer and I've

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,710
already done some enum so I just add

00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:37,150
here above and below and maybe it's it's

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:40,000
already Friday afternoon so I just click

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:47,860
here and copy this and paste it here so

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,210
it's above and this one is below so we

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,030
have really the possibility now to

00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,330
change things here so we can say for

00:07:52,030 --> 00:08:00,280
example it's a buff now okay or it's

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:04,420
below now or it's not visible at all so

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,670
this was not that big yeah and yeah this

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,360
was just was that the second thing I did

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,400
so we had a toddler vacation and we had

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,470
increasing or decreasing speed and I

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,090
think okay it should be done now

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,270
everything's covered by the slider

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,340
everything that could possible be

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,850
required but yeah that's that's not true

00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,960
actually

00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:27,580
and I think another two days later or

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,380
something like this this is it okay we

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,450
used to slider and we get the slider

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,300
definitions for my API and we wanted to

00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,010
save us some slides and I actually

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,229
didn't know how to do it yeah I could

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,090
add a boolean here to disable slides or

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,430
I could pass an array of indices to

00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,950
disable slides and so I did what I could

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,760
develop a does I took a look at existing

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,570
implementation so who knows chica Rui

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,370
who knows it okay nobody

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,620
nobody wants to say it anymore does he

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,699
knows it yeah so gqi where I was a big

00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,380
thing back in the days

00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:01,410
actually when I when I did this stuff

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,019
and I think it's still it's still a

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,870
valid library I mean the time of Chico U

00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,579
is a little bit over but if you need

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,199
some reference implementation it's still

00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:12,360
ok and if you take a look at the taps

00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,490
it's something quite similar what I've

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,310
done was to slider it's a possibility to

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,259
switch between tabs yeah I mean we don't

00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,569
have this rolling effect but actually we

00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,000
have some kind of similar structure and

00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:25,860
if you go to the API documentation

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,480
that's what I did and I found out okay

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,160
there's something called disabled so

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,259
there seems to be a possibility to

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,480
disable tabs and what they take a look

00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:36,990
at it okay to get an an array of indeed

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:40,850
says and I said okay then the solution

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,470
would be something like this disabled

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,560
and it's I don't know it's just an array

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:50,250
of things it says and then I took a look

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,160
at it and I thought okay yeah I mean

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:57,959
this this looks shitty actually yeah so

00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:02,790
maybe just add some new lines and after

00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:06,560
doing this okay actually it's still look

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,970
shitty so what to do now and somehow I

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,860
remembered that the seven slow of

00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,910
computer programming who knows the seven

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,490
slow of computer programming nobody yeah

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:19,920
I didn't know it you ADA I just found it

00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,930
in Twitter while I go and it's really

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,670
it's really clever because what it

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,500
actually says and that's the only slide

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,329
you will see today the same as law of

00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,069
computer programming I don't know the

00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,470
first six I don't know if there are

00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:34,230
first six but the same as Louis is

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,959
really is really genius yeah it says

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,480
that programming complexity grows until

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,160
exceeds the capability of programming to

00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,880
maintain it so what does this actually

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:47,519
mean this means that people will put new

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,550
features into your software as long as

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,649
you are able to maintain your crap yeah

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,689
so as long as you will be able to say

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,699
okay I can put new features into the

00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:59,160
software they will give you new features

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:01,829
yeah and normally we all notice when you

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,740
have been to a couple of projects this

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,400
will end someday someday costs will

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,780
increase in

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,170
you will and say okay I won't do this

00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:12,420
anymore because it doesn't pay off yeah

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,430
just just renaming for two thousand year

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,860
which doesn't pay off here business

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,740
understands is normally so when you

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,750
think about it in the other way it means

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,810
that people will need new features

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,640
forever if you're able to pull software

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,800
that will be maintainable forever they

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,120
will meet they will need new features

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,310
forever and actually that's what I've

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,960
sought here so when I ate a disabled

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,050
well they will need something else

00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,410
so something maybe like I don't know

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:45,570
selected so to select a slide at the

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,270
beginning yeah something like this oh I

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:51,590
don't know many different ideas came up

00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:54,660
to my to myself and I have to prove

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:57,860
actually I have to prove that the sevens

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,240
law of computer programming is well it

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,630
because I've already told you about gql

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,280
UI and there's one component I'm glad

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:08,370
sure everybody of you has already used

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,380
it's the date picker everybody used it I

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,210
don't know if you used to this program

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,760
about as user I'm quite sure you used it

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,230
and the date picker is I think this was

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,390
one of the selling points of Chico you

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,460
actually because everybody needed a date

00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:22,950
pick at the back in the days and it was

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,540
very configurable and when you take a

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,460
look at the take pick up a tape you have

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,010
to take picker it's quite interesting

00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,310
because it actually has about 70 options

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:36,270
or methods you can configure whatever

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:38,130
you want yeah and I thought okay when I

00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,770
don't change anything I will end up like

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,620
the date picker yeah and I don't want to

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,510
end up like hgq I would date picker and

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,370
so I thought about it and I thought okay

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,010
what can I prove here what would I

00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,740
actually expect from a Gorge reliable

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,590
and for and and and maintainable and

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,210
also extendable components and I said

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:00,330
okay what I would really like to see

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,860
here is something like this that I have

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,620
some angle of you know slide yeah I

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,590
didn't I forget to mention it's actually

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,920
the angle of Vienna slide yeah no that's

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,350
bad and the angle of Vienna slide it

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,140
just takes a slide and passes into the

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,900
slide is definition so that's what I

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,740
expected so just just let's create it so

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,060
and

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,930
generate component and it's just a slide

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:30,090
can you see it yeah

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:32,460
okay so we've created a slide and we

00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,430
just add some simple style to the slide

00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,110
it's not not that important for you and

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,460
when we take a look at the slide it

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:51,030
actually takes some input which is

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:53,370
definition inputs here and when we go to

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,140
the slider we will find out that this is

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,330
actually the thing which is called the

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,860
slide we can see it on the class and we

00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:02,250
can also see it on the for loop so I

00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:05,850
will just cut cut it add some energy

00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:07,680
content here go to the slide and we'll

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,620
paste it here okay

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,240
so things changed a little bit but

00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,310
actually not that much as you would

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,870
maybe expect so there's no energy for

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:19,350
anymore because the energy for moved

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:21,540
outside and the definitions stayed the

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:26,760
same so everything seems to be pretty

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:30,770
similar like before so I think it should

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,770
like work it should work like before

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,770
okay so when I go here to the slider to

00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:44,450
the app component I just moved to slide

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,450
into the slider and

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,630
and sorry I just have to remove the

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,500
slides here because I've already done

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:08,790
them here so when I go back now I will

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:12,210
get some some I will get actually some

00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:14,120
angle I was here I'm sorry it's hard to

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:18,410
trick an error if you want to actually

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,240
and it's easy because the slider itself

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,860
takes the slides definitions now and it

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,450
doesn't get any slight definitions here

00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,730
anymore because I remove them because we

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,770
move them to the inside so I can just

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,920
remove the input and now of course

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:34,050
there's some some undefined so I just

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,520
set it to an empty array seems to work

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,650
again but the slider will not roll

00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,960
anymore and it's quite clear when you

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,790
take a look at the code you see okay

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,200
it takes a look at the length of the

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,270
slides and the length of the slides is

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,370
almost zero so it will not change the

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,520
current index from zero to something

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,100
else so how do we get the slides from

00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,709
the slide components to the slider well

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,470
aunt and there's actually a I don't know

00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:03,240
if it's well-known a really cool feature

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:05,010
in angular which allows you to inject a

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,680
parent component in your current

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,750
component yeah so if your a slider if

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,450
you're a slide component you can eject

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,300
each parent component so it will just go

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,680
up and we'll find that the parent

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,050
component you want to inject you so it's

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,700
the slider component in our case and as

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:25,110
we have to slider component now we can

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:28,860
just say the slider which is the slide

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,860
for example and put in the definition so

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:36,330
our current slide so we'll just add a

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:39,209
new method in the slider and when you go

00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:42,270
to the slider files code already

00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:45,000
generated this method so we remove it a

00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:48,020
little bit down and we will just rename

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,020
some things here

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:57,530
so we have to slide here and all we have

00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:01,280
to do is the slides dot Porsche don't

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:05,600
slide ok so when we go back to the slide

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:09,230
up the the slider will start rolling

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,750
again hopefully yeah so that's quite

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,540
cool so we have the possibility to now

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,000
which is the our slides to the slider

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,280
well and that's some kind of glue code

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,990
we cannot see from outside but the slide

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,530
actually always knows that is inside the

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,209
slider okay so but I'm not quite happy

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,820
with this with the slider

00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,530
I would expect something like removing

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,510
this to somewhere else because when you

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,310
think think of single responsibilities

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,720
this slider does a little bit too much

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,460
yeah it knows you put the top navigation

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,440
he knows about the speed you knows about

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:42,830
the way that they hate so maybe let's

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:48,380
add something called a rotator I think

00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:50,000
it's particular locator and this

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:54,710
actually takes the speed and the width

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,520
and the height and so we just just

00:17:54,710 --> 00:18:04,550
finish it here and we remove this stuff

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:05,300
from here and we just know there's no

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,880
typo

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:15,080
oh yeah thanks yeah pull request live

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:20,240
pull requests here so I will just create

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:25,250
a new component called vertical rotator

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,370
and this vertical rotator should as the

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,830
name says think about this rotation

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,180
stuff yeah sure I don't want to have to

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,120
slide it to do this I want to have a

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:37,010
rotator to do this and well it's a

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,900
little bit the same story we go into

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,210
this slider and take a look at it what

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:44,000
do we need actually in the rotator so

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,100
the slides a part of the slider that's

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,930
fine but the width the hate and the

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,570
speed the office attained of our

00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:53,380
subscriber the ng on it they go to slide

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:58,370
and the ng on destroy I actually part of

00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:01,970
the rotator so we just cut them go back

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:05,090
to the slide rotator and just insert the

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,100
stuff here go back to the slider removed

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,490
engi on in it because we don't have it

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,990
anymore and when we take a look at it

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,030
the slide will take this actually slide

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:17,030
container how it's called in here so we

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,240
just removed this say get ng-content

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:27,700
and we move this to the vertical load

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:34,340
data in the HTML and we'll add some

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:37,390
imports and we need this constructor

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:42,560
trick again we just say constructure

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:45,950
just add private slider which is a

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:48,080
slider component and just take it here

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,730
and say this slider slides length so we

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,170
get again the slides from slider

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:58,720
component and we just need some vertical

00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:00,860
rotator style again and when we go back

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,080
everything should work as expected

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,740
always before yeah that's that's that's

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,670
pretty neat

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,860
so we can get take a look at it and

00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,570
things starts to look a little bit nice

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,050
so we have two slider with this vertical

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:18,500
rotator and we have two slides in it but

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:20,360
I still don't like this one here so how

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,210
can we handle this yeah so it's quite

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,390
easy just another component which is

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,960
called something like top navigation up

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:33,950
top navigation can you read this

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:39,940
actually okay so we just add the top

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:42,950
navigation and the top navigation is

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:46,430
again copied from the from the slider we

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:49,130
just we just cut out this here and we

00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:52,210
also remove this one and we go to the

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:57,670
dot navigation we just add it here oh

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,670
sorry just add it here

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:07,010
and we get back to the slider and get

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,870
some other stuff

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,909
slider get some other stuff like the top

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,830
navigation options and the dots that's

00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:15,630
actually what we need in our top

00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,059
navigation so our slider gets very tiny

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:21,059
it only contains two slides and there

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:24,840
which is the slight possibility and we

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,210
move this to the top navigation and of

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,360
course we have to do this constructure

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:35,299
thing again so we just say okay private

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,950
slider to slide our component and

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:39,929
actually we need to import some things

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:42,899
but not everything because we can

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,760
actually move this enum now to the top

00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:47,029
navigation component because it holds

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,610
all the information it needs about it

00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:54,600
and then we say again this slider that

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:56,340
slice of map and we should have some

00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:02,399
nice top navigation again now we don't

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:05,220
have okay yeah for sure so we need to do

00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:07,740
some updates here we can remove this

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,630
first of all ten things should work

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,820
again yeah and then we need some top

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,789
navigation slider so it's top navigation

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:24,350
we just add this here so we say below

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:24,350
and okay that's unexpected actually

00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:31,490
yeah that's that shouldn't be oh yeah

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,860
yeah yeah you're right

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:38,270
singing it's not insert the sliders oh I

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:45,850
cannot access the slider and we need

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:49,610
some total navigation stars and we

00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:52,070
cannot read the property below okay yeah

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,980
sure because we have to wrong input you

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:58,370
because we moved an enum so we can just

00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,760
say okay important new enum I think's

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,350
work again yeah but it's still not

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,270
working completely because to go to

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:08,270
slider doesn't work yeah and when we go

00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,980
back to the slider thought forest code

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,330
already showed us that this code to

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,370
slice not defined anymore

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,169
and now things get a little bit more

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,330
tricky yet holy stuff and I was was

00:23:15,169 --> 00:23:19,070
really easy and it was something of the

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,529
same just moving things out to

00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:23,539
components but the code to slide is a

00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:26,120
little bit different because if you sing

00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:29,690
about it they're actually the vertical

00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,270
rotator holds the actually the actual

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:37,250
slide was the offset and the problem is

00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:38,840
that our top navigation is not a child

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,760
of the vertical rotator

00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,460
so we cannot do is in check the trig

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:47,419
another time so we have to sing about

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,610
something else and actually the current

00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:52,220
slide is some kind of state and we want

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,169
to move our state to some kind of

00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,690
container component in our case this is

00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:59,630
the slider for sure so we just say okay

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:03,320
the slider should actually hold the

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:06,289
actual state of the current slide so we

00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,820
just say okay add a subject here so

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:09,679
everybody knows what the subject is it's

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,559
just an observable and observer and in

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,279
one thing we could also actually we

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,510
could add a behavior subject here buddy

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,070
don't make things more complicated at

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,559
the shop pizzo a subject is just it

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,529
observable and observing in one thing so

00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:26,960
you can't just say okay Karen slide emit

00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:30,289
something to it or just subscribe to it

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,630
and that's pretty pretty handy in this

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:35,870
in this use case because all we can do

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:39,399
now is we can say okay this slider can

00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,399
slide subscribe

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:46,040
we get the current slide and we just can

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,190
say okay we now have to define which

00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:53,350
index discount slide is so we can just

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:58,640
do this but this slider slides index off

00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:02,960
slide so that's the current slide index

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,940
actually and all we have to do is we

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,400
just have to copy this and then we're

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,260
going to the current slide that's easy

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,720
but the problem is that the interval

00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,760
subscribe or the interval doesn't set

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,470
actually the current slide so that's I

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,200
mean it will work but it's not really

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,120
beautiful so when we change the current

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,640
slide we should also propagate it to the

00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:27,049
top to the state and so we can just say

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,990
okay this slider can't slide and we

00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:35,660
should sing next and add our slide and

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:37,370
this can be done but this slider I mean

00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,929
yeah we could expect some things here

00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:43,520
but you know what I mean

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:47,150
for for the point right now so you know

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,330
I'm just putting the current slide next

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:51,919
to the subject so everybody who

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,510
subscribed to the subject will get

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,480
information okay there's a new current

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,720
current slide actually okay so far so

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,340
clear okay cool

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,169
so we've done this and all we have to do

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,960
is now in the top navigation we also

00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:11,809
have to manipulate the current slide so

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:13,490
we just say okay go to slide and for

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,790
simplicity maybe it should take just a

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:24,350
slide another dot so we just say slide

00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:27,140
slides and slides definition and we just

00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:29,540
remove this just this map here so we

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,840
have a list of slide definitions here

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,120
and of course we have to rename it and

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,490
then we just say go to slide and we just

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:43,840
will pass the slide and it takes the

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:48,470
slide here we just say this slider

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:51,570
current slide next slide

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,010
okay so we can change the current slide

00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,960
from two positions and that will

00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,210
actually what we have done and when we

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:03,660
go back to the component it's really

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:05,400
working it's really working okay yeah

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,280
it's working you know there are two

00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,750
intervals and stay they do fight each

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,790
other but actually it's working so you

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,200
can move around with this top navigation

00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:18,420
so it's fair enough

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,510
and actually we miss another feature we

00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,670
had before and we missed this so we can

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,640
say okay top navigation options above

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,800
and as you might guess this will not

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,150
work it just will not be shown and it

00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,540
will not be shown because we have this

00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:36,510
ng-if in here so if we remove the ngf it

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,880
will be shown but it will not be above

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,100
here you can you can think about it and

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,990
the cool thing about compound components

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,820
is that actually we don't need this we

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,530
don't need to said about telling a

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,560
component where it should be you we can

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:54,210
completely remove this and when we go to

00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:57,680
the app component we can now say okay

00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:00,240
you know I don't need you anymore

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,360
can remove the input and I can remove

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:08,820
this this inference and you say it's

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:11,280
still working okay and actually if you

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,260
just want to have it above well just

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,930
move it above yeah that's actually how

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,930
HTML works if you think about it yeah so

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:24,690
it's just above yeah and if you don't

00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,450
want to have it just remove it yeah so I

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,790
think that's I mean it seems to be like

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,800
very very simple and little idea but

00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,870
actually this changed a lot yeah so if

00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,650
you have this possibility of compound

00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:40,320
components and if you really say okay we

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,960
we put the structure into our energy

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,150
content then you get a lot of benefits

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,340
from moving things around as you like to

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,320
have them yeah so you can just say okay

00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,030
it's there and maybe it's not there and

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,040
maybe it's on both sides I actually

00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,250
don't know if this works I've never

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,930
tried it but yeah it's working yeah and

00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,520
you know that that that would be really

00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,440
hard to achieve as attributes yeah you

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,280
could add another

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,710
and you could add another ng-if but the

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,050
structure putting into the energy

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:12,470
content is quite quite a genius idea

00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:14,780
here okay and when you think about HTML

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,700
it exactly works this way when you think

00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,670
of the table or or when you think of a

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,200
body think of the body element let's say

00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,180
that the people who invented the body

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,730
element in the in the in the HTML

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,620
standard a while ago said okay we have

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,510
an attribute text and you could put in a

00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,310
text here into your body yeah I mean

00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,710
that's what maybe work out for the first

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,500
two months of the internet but right now

00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,230
we would have picked problems and that's

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,480
just the main idea yet to get a little

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:44,540
bit around these attributes and just

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,180
saying how HTML actually sinks and when

00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,880
you move this a little bit forward you

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:54,830
can do crazy things with this actually I

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:57,590
mean crazy Crazy's relative but at least

00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,420
you can do some nice things and I've

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,450
prepared some some other things for

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,000
example here it looks quite similar and

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,980
I've just removed a vertical rotator

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,750
with a horizontal rotator yeah these are

00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:11,090
things you can actually start to do and

00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,460
people can extend your components by

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,500
providing their own child components

00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,660
yeah you don't have to provide provide

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,340
everything by an API you can't just say

00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,290
okay if you need a heart since I'll

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,570
rotator just edit or maybe you need a

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,560
circle rotator person with an angle I

00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,060
didn't know then just add it here and

00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,920
actually it should work it should it

00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:34,160
should scroll horizontal so that's

00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:36,230
that's that's quite cool and I still

00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,390
unlike this dead much because what I

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,270
would like what I would really expect is

00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,930
something like this and just go back to

00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,930
the another repository

00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:53,870
so this is what I would like to have so

00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,850
this is a little bit more in-depth when

00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:58,970
you think about compound components so

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,890
we removed all this stuff here this

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,840
background image and caption and

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,300
description because actually I think

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,610
this should not be part it should not be

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,530
a strict definition what you put inside

00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,330
the slider and when you take a look at

00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,520
this one here okay you can put in

00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:15,320
whatever you want you can put in h1 you

00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,070
can style it from outside which is a big

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,020
benefit

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:22,190
you can add another day if you can add a

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:24,590
narrative and it will still work yeah

00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,780
you see it's test here okay and that's

00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:29,810
pretty neat and I've done another thing

00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,550
here which I don't see that often I

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,290
think you see it sometimes in angular

00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:35,660
material if you use it so you just

00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:38,330
provide in an NG template normally you

00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:40,670
do it was a directive I just I just put

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:45,500
in reference here and the cool thing is

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:49,040
I've just trade it and angle of we and a

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:51,620
menu and this angle of V and a menu just

00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,770
uses the template as the menu item okay

00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:57,650
so we have all the data stored into our

00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,180
slider and it can be reused because it's

00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,320
the ng template and if you take a look

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,140
at it if you're interested

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,910
this ly definition now has some template

00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:10,100
ref and actually the slide itself just

00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,990
which is reduces the content child which

00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,210
is the thumbnail and add it to the

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,230
template ref yeah so it's pretty similar

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,270
to what we've done before

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:22,610
it's just transporting HTML from from

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:25,670
one side to the other and the slider

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:29,290
itself or empty menu itself just uses

00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:33,680
this energy container to put in the inch

00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:35,360
the template so that's quite cool and of

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,980
course you can still move their menu

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,400
around yeah if you want to you can just

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:42,500
put it above well that's that's that

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,620
stuff which is just working here and

00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,170
don't need any epi you just can do the

00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,420
user do whatever he wants well and

00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,860
that's that's actually it that's

00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,570
actually what I wanted to show you today

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:59,900
and the cool thing is that we have

00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:02,029
another great impact I see or I create

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,669
advantage if you know about this

00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:06,499
isn't a Chanel and containing components

00:33:04,669 --> 00:33:07,969
we have to see it for free because all

00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:10,729
the state is actually in the slider

00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:12,169
because it knows about I was saying it

00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,729
knows about all the slides it knows

00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:15,619
about what's the current slide so we can

00:33:13,729 --> 00:33:17,269
move it up to a container component and

00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,799
all the other slides are just dumb

00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:22,609
components to get all the information

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,710
you need and we've done this constructor

00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:27,229
thing here while this can be used

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,239
actually but there's another way I would

00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:31,729
also like to show you which is quite

00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:33,229
important so if you get the slides here

00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:40,309
you could also do another trick you

00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:43,820
could just say okay content children and

00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:46,460
I hope you know content tool and it

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,739
allows you to get the content children

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,849
of your current your your current

00:33:50,739 --> 00:33:59,229
components and it will change the query

00:33:52,849 --> 00:34:04,549
list so it's a little bit different okay

00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:06,049
thank you for nothing okay and it's it

00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:08,569
will not work now out of the box because

00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,760
it's actually observable but it's pretty

00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:13,099
neat also because you have the

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,619
possibility now to don't have two

00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,629
registers child but the container knows

00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,270
who are actually my child's yeah so it's

00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:23,720
little bit moving responsibilities from

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:26,389
from the slide knows okay above media is

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,569
a slider from the slider knows okay

00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,639
below media slides okay that's just just

00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:34,609
one more trick I wanted to show you yeah

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,529
actually that's it and if you take a

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:38,929
look at it I hope that you will also

00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:40,940
realize that things look a little bit

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:43,789
more maintainable actually then they

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:47,599
looked before and yeah I hope you

00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:51,260
understand the key last night Eloisa was

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,090
a pretty old slider over the years thank

00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,219
you for listening

00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,219
