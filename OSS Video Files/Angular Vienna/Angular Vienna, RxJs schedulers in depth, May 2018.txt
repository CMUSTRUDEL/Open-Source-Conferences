	Michael Hladky:

Schedulers are baked into RxJs. But it's not a well-known topic.
In this talk, I will reveal the internals of Schedulers, show how to use them in operators, control subscription with it.
I will also control and change time as well as use it to test code.

In the end, you will have a clear picture of what schedulers are as well as some practical examples that you can reuse.
