I18N and translations using Angular's dependency injection and lazy-loading

If you've ever had a problem with the maintenance of i18n and translations, there is a simple solution. TypeScript, dependency injection and lazy loading as an elegant way to have your project translated and under control.

There is a solution for easy and maintainable i18n for Angular projects.

TypeScript knows all we need and dependency injection will provide the way, with just a little bit of router’s elegant lazy-loading.
Translations have a type definition inferred from a default translation, data is injected via dependency injection provider.

Each site mutation is lazy loaded as a module that consists of an imported wrapped site module (shared for all mutations) and its own i18n stuff.
