Title: Angular Vienna, Reactive dynamic Forms, January 2019
Publication date: 2019-01-21
Playlist: Angular Vienna
Description: 
	Angular Reactive Forms are awesome! But did you ever try to build a huge data-driven app? It's a pain!
In this talk we're going to level up our skills and uncover the true power of Angular forms. We'll dive deep into fully configuration based, model driven, dynamic forms that will supercharge every Angular app. We will see how to create an abstraction layer around our forms that facilitate high reusability and allows us to create new forms in minutes.

before starting I also have to mention

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,560
something ng Vikings like our cool

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,990
friends from the very northern part of

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,059
Europe are again organizing their

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,200
awesome conference and Gy kings as you

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,179
maybe know that they're traveling

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,880
conference so last year was in Helsinki

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,140
was really cool D Series in Copenhagen

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,029
it's on 27th 28th of May they also have

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,310
to call for papers open til end of

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:29,250
January I guess so if you're interested

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:36,420
definitely submit your talk and go and

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:39,390
speak there yeah see all right so Who am

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,640
I as Michael said I'm used to honor I'm

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,070
a Google very expert in web technologies

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,829
specifically angry or mostly focused on

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,110
angular I'm coming from Italy actually

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,700
it's very northern part of Italy so we

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,219
speak German there it's very similar

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,640
dialect as here in also so I perfectly

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,010
understand everyone here I work here the

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,739
local company called our fridges we do

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,149
web development with angular on the

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,339
mobile part and with geographic

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,320
information systems on the side I'm also

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,270
a trainer and consultant doing mostly

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,100
on-site workshops speaking at conference

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,380
or meetups like this one here and I'm

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,939
also an axehead our instructor these are

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,090
some of the course which are already out

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:20,280
there a bit of a spoiler next week

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,840
probably should be a new course that

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,460
should be released from me which is

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,710
about web components which Marshall

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,119
talked about so with angular elements

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,939
and that kind of stuff it's more

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,619
introductory talk interactive course so

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,079
definitely keep an eye on my Twitter

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,570
handle or an axehead one it will be

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,630
released and these are the place

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,579
basically where you can find me online

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,220
now I'm gonna speak today to you about

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,140
forums now forms are probably the least

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,270
interesting part in applications right

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,280
like I don't really like to develop them

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,590
but still if we create large business

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,259
applications or a lot of forms and it

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,780
can also be quite complex usually and so

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,299
as you probably know we have two type of

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,640
forms in angular we have those template

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,829
written forms and model driven forms

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,229
they're also more popular with the name

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,729
reactive forms and so how can we

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,530
distinguish them while the template

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,970
driven forms just very quickly because

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,120
probably you know it already these are

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,910
those with that

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,530
and you model on them you write them in

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,870
HTML you can also do some kind of

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,980
validation that in HTML so this really

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:27,340
is simplified of course and then we have

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,050
people that tell you well you don't

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,879
shoot you shouldn't reuse it at the

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,849
model at the tablet or m4 so it should

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,280
go more in reactive way right why is

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:39,730
that well because reactive forms are

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,400
usually more powerful and to recap

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:44,650
reactive forms are created on the

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,120
component class side so we don't start

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,950
on the template side we started the

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,049
component side will define our template

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,030
our model how it should be structured

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:54,160
and what we want a data bind but then of

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,810
course we also have to go to the HTML

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,519
part again because we somehow have to

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,650
connect that model which we build which

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,090
might be nice and clean to our HTML

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,910
controls where the user actually

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,670
interacts with them as it was I was

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,319
curious and back in July last year I

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,019
created a poll which had quite some

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,060
response about 700 of them what do you

00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,959
actually use use more to tablet written

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,430
or the more room the reactive forms and

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,989
so people said why reactive forms all

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,450
the way there's less magic involved you

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:24,639
see exactly what you have to do and it's

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,130
much more clear also business complex

00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,260
business logic which is complex it's

00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,150
hard to handle with the template

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,299
equipment approach it's easier with the

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,250
reactive approach jumpable response is

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,900
more like while more towards the

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,280
reactive approach but she can totally

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,170
understand if people have a hard time

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,790
initially when they get into angular to

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,220
understand the reactive approach because

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,200
there are two concepts writers that the

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,900
whole form har but it's also a reactive

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,540
nature of how you build the forms and

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,730
well Olivier said while depending on

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,180
simple forms more template driven

00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,310
reactive comics forms more reactive and

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,769
that's probably the one we all think

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,959
about that it's probably if you if you

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,519
don't have to use them just don't use

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,799
them but that's obviously not the

00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,079
reality so my point is there's a lot of

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,930
typing involved life like I use reactive

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,630
forms mostly because as for them the

00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,280
things we just mentioned but the promise

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,200
you have to type a lot and you have to a

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,609
lot of duplicate stuff there because if

00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,099
you look for instance that very simple

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:26,590
form we have the model part in this side

00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:28,210
where for instance we defined the

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,740
the first name validations and stuff but

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,020
then an example its ID we have to do the

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,100
exact same thing like an HTML part we

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,930
also have to implement that now dynamic

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,060
forms like now you may say while it's

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,500
already complex enough ye dynamic forms

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,300
well let me explain with dynamic

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,190
approach I basically define different

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,100
kind of flowers of dynamic city like I

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,020
have dynamic in the sense of you write

00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,410
some kind of configuration in the code

00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,910
and HTML parts and generate somehow so

00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,650
that's the kind of dynamic thing which

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,900
will we focus today and that is

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,850
obviously the full dynamic where the

00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,040
server-side part expose you how the form

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,760
should be constructed right and then the

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:11,770
form construct by itself basically and

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,840
that second part is that's the use case

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,060
we shall see actually a lot and always

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,560
more often but then the Surfside part

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,000
has to play with it as well right you

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,260
have to have the poor coordinating

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,330
structures on the server side as well to

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,889
support that kind of form generation

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,750
coming directly from their server side

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,820
so that's what we would like to focus

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,380
today like you change your typescript

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,120
code and you don't have to think about

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,539
your HTML part over there that's gonna

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,180
be generated automatically so in theory

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:39,100
like if we have this react to form as in

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,690
this case here we could do it also by

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,270
ourselves like this is very simple you

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,550
see here just one input field with that

00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,919
full control name first name and then I

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,590
have two code behind like in my

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,120
component I create that form group that

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,220
model just as you do in a normal

00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,070
reactive form approach and that's it

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,710
well what I could do is actually go step

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:01,990
further and not only keep that form

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,400
control name static as it was before if

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,200
I switch back you see here the first

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,940
control name is just first name is the

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,610
string but I could actually bind it

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,010
right so I could bind it to this field

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,260
name which now is somehow dynamic so I

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,660
could decide at runtime to which kind of

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,310
property I would like to bind and so in

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,370
this way you can already start imagining

00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,770
how I could in start generating form

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,750
somehow dynamically right based on my

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,570
code side so for instance for such an

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,600
object here I could create this form

00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:33,460
control this form group automatically by

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
just iterating over the objects

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,270
properties I would use it just saying a

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,310
configuration I generate here the form

00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,479
controls as you can see with the

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,150
property that I get

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,699
the object I instantiate that form group

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,499
and then I pass it to my HTML Aneesh

00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:50,169
maladjusted have to create at once so I

00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:52,419
have your properties I loop over them I

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,089
have my input types here and I bind them

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:57,129
to them to my dynamic part which I just

00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:58,059
generated right and we will get

00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,960
something like that

00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:03,069
so very simple it would already work

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,330
that's the output which you would get

00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,400
like that's just the form value

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,800
serialize so we see that matches what we

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,050
want to get out of it now what about the

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,509
input type like I just had an input type

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:17,169
text here right it's very simple okay I

00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:19,120
could start bind that as well right but

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,339
then what about like select box they

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,659
have a different tag altogether so I

00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,300
would have to change that as well

00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:27,039
if you see it it starts to continue in

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,740
doesn't get that easy

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,539
for simple use case that works I create

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,399
extra knackered course which I walk

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,169
through this kind of thing like also how

00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,330
to add validation and to build your own

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:39,969
kind of mini framework for doing that

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,379
and it suggested for simpler produce but

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,960
that one things get more complicated

00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:46,300
like complicated validations that maybe

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,430
depending fields which connect with each

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,210
other like hiding fields showing this it

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,889
gets messy and so therefore I want to

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,860
focus on something today which is called

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,289
angular formally like that someone maybe

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,360
recognize this one from angularjs times

00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,459
like there's a really cool library there

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,529
which was built by can see dots or

00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:07,870
mainly maintained by him for a very long

00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:10,180
time and it turns out the same line we

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,399
also exists for angular now since about

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,770
a year and last half-year there they

00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,719
really improved a lot and so let's

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,180
quickly have a look how that works well

00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:20,919
how you could use it in your application

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,050
now inject for me mainly consists of two

00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:24,999
different kind of parts like you have

00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,919
that cool part which has the whole core

00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,419
logic like the whole form generation

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,610
validation stuff and that kind of things

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,199
and then on this side you have two

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,729
different kind of UI themes which it

00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,649
supports because that's also really

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,659
really important as we have also heard

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,519
today like you have Princeton material

00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,169
approach you can have bootstrap Prime

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,789
and G it also supported even mobile

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,740
parts so you can see ionic and native

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,480
script so it has a variety of

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,970
implementations and of course you could

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,339
also implement your own I test something

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,710
else totally possible and will probably

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:55,810
very quickly see it as well

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,370
how does this leash work actually very

00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,320
simple as you do normally with an

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,410
external package you can just install it

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,180
over MTR or it also supports the

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,070
schematics which we have heard today as

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,410
well like schematics not only help you

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,029
to generate new code but library offers

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,740
actually have also the possibility to

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,270
facilitate the installation to make it

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,990
easier for the users to install their

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,160
library so they can provide such install

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,800
schematics and that will then set up

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,420
your project automatically so you can

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,820
just execute this command and it will

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,240
already work and have formally set up

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,890
for you then obviously this will also be

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,050
generated out of the schematics

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,760
otherwise you you add it by hand you

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,709
basically register that root part and

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,480
then you referred you while I read that

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,070
case I'm using firmly material but in

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,270
general you could use one of those

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:46,870
others which we have seen right form the

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:49,390
basics now let me do something which

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,100
normally act like me only channel clock

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,670
you shouldn't do switch to your code

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,640
editor so let me just quickly show you

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,589
how this actually works does it you get

00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,150
an idea so for instance let's first of

00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:09,390
all have a look here at HTML part and

00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,180
HTML part is usually have your normal

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,589
reactive form okay that's not saying

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,700
strange here yeah you have to form group

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:17,680
which you have to instantiate you have

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,360
to submit event you have to button

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,820
switch you're totally free where to

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,190
place them the key part here is that for

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,900
me form in the middle I guess you can

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,480
probably imagine when we installed

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,820
formally we got that component we can

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,589
reference that in our template wherever

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,209
we want to place it in our form you

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,070
could even mix it up like you could have

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:38,440
your plane normal reactive format and

00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,880
adding that for me form and this is

00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,579
where than a name each part basically

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,320
happens and so you have your three parts

00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,760
you have that model which is actually

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,339
they eaten which you get from a server

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,470
like you the data object you have that

00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:52,810
the fields which is the configuration

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,279
which we'll see in a minute and then you

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,810
have to form itself like you passed the

00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,060
reference in such that form internally

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,480
can hookah validation and invalidate the

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,570
form whenever it needs to great so with

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,600
that actual HTML part is done so we can

00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:09,459
move that apart and we can now focus

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,079
 part how we generate that

00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:13,839
configuration which then creates the

00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,300
form automatically so what I have done

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,040
here is I've prepared here a static

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,959
model that obviously in real-world

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,449
example would come from your server you

00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:25,720
would do a normal HTTP fat and you will

00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:27,730
get it and then below here we have that

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,980
fields which we have seen was bound

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,569
before to our formal component so that

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,160
was the model which we bound in to our

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:35,139
formal component that was world where it

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,399
feels right now you're empty which is

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,250
also why here you don't see anything

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,980
right so we can start map like that

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:43,750
first name first and so what you do is

00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,160
you create that kind of configuration so

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,230
after that array where you're passing

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,180
the fields what you want to render so

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,829
usually you have the key which is the

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,130
property you wanted address for instance

00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:55,930
first name then you have to type what

00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,690
you have to give him which is type input

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,870
just usually case most of the part and

00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,100
then you have to template options and

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,470
label what you want to associate for

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,779
instance first name in this case now if

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,399
I save this would you already see

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:11,440
something happen on the side as you can

00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,990
see the field already gets rendered it

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,759
gets also data bound automatically so

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,430
formally recognized the first name

00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,500
property of that above works it should

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,709
render an input type and it binds the

00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,910
data here below you see how it is being

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,509
rendered this is just the serialization

00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,759
of form dot value right mind my document

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:32,380
my HTML part and this is the model which

00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:35,079
we get from the server is basically that

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,970
part above here now the interesting part

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:39,220
is if I change this of course you would

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,199
expect to form value to change what

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,350
formally does is it also changes the

00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,819
model so it keeps both parts in sync and

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,529
this can be really a huge advantage

00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:50,769
sometimes when you have to do cross

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,810
validation that kind of things all right

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,660
and so we could continue now doing the

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,569
same for each property right I just copy

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,149
and paste this here I adhere to H the

00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,370
label as well we could not change this a

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,689
bit and say well it is an input but in

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:07,630
Tier II what I could do here is I

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:09,880
provide a type number because actually I

00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,980
want adjust that user can provide here

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,899
numbers not strings or something and you

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,910
can really see how this here changed

00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:18,370
like I have these errors now I can move

00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,430
up and down with the keys and I cannot

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,940
type any kind of strings in there

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:26,880
I just customized already to control now

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,410
this is so very simple of course it gets

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,440
more you're seeing here with these two

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,270
like these our basically select boxes

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,630
right drop-down fields which I want to

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:39,390
feel and so again here what I do is I

00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,130
bind to your nation ID I say the type

00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,279
here is no more an input but it's the

00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:46,920
Select router then you've give it

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:50,310
template options which will be my sale

00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,990
label nation this is also the part where

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,459
you would provide localization if you

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,410
have some localization to apply you

00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:57,870
would just localize it and pass it into

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:01,020
phone it directly here and then the

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,209
different part for the drop-down fields

00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,060
of course is that they need to have some

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:09,810
options right and usually they are of

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:13,490
the form like say here Italy and value

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:20,490
is one and then it could continue label

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:22,339
Austria and values to I save it and now

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,380
let's see things crossed yeah we get a

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,360
drop-down field rendered you can see the

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,160
fields here Israel already beta binds to

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,279
Italy like when I provide here for

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:36,180
instance an empty value let's say

00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,680
something like this well you know then

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,500
you will see that it doesn't bind you

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,209
the first one but it binds to the it's

00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,459
only one basically the correct one

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:46,620
because it knows that the nation is one

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:48,600
and Italy actually corresponds to one

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,190
because I added it down here so it does

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,020
already the data binding for me and if I

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,570
change you can see how it changes below

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,220
as well now of course this is a damn

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:58,529
example you wouldn't do something that

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,740
in a real code right you would keep

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:03,360
fetch that from some service and the

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,490
nice thing here is below here I have

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,320
just the city service which returns

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,240
already observables which could be HTTP

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,740
calls which I get from the server so

00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,160
these are observed so I could just do

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,190
something like that do get nations and I

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,720
get the nations in now and it's already

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,339
data bound and I have here various

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,110
options which directly come now from my

00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:24,089
server and the nice thing is actually

00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,980
this is an answer like I just pass it in

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,110
I don't have to subscribe first and

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,940
serialize it put it some local variable

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,579
and then bind it but I can just pass it

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,000
in through and for me has this option

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,650
for a lot of different kind of

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,480
which you can set like it has really

00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,060
good observer support which you can

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:45,430
provide out the box

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:48,100
cool same thing for city ID but now

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,220
actually in the city ID I would like to

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,260
have that dependent on basically my

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,900
nation's above right so what I could do

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,930
here is I could of course just do get

00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,360
cities I guess yeah

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:03,550
and so I get here the nation and the

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,260
cities below but I would actually like

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,260
the knees to cooperate right when I

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,940
change the nation involve above the

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,450
cities below should automatically change

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,190
and adapt themselves and you can totally

00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,310
do that as well here what you can have

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,440
is so-called hooks hoops our way to

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,600
register into that component when it

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,460
gets generated you say for instance on

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,930
the on in it whenever that component

00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:31,200
starts I got here some field which is

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,000
such a formula field configuration and

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,370
from there I can base it and go to the

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,339
form control and now we are back into

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,740
reactive form land right so I can get

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,380
here basically my nation and II for

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,410
instance I can use the value changes I

00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:52,630
can pipe that through and say for

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:56,620
instance switch map that I get here the

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:59,260
city ID and go this through and call a

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,690
city service and get me the cities which

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,900
match that nation ID or a city and

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,510
nation are you actually so here we will

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:12,430
get nationally of course and we get that

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:18,730
in I just subscribe to it I get here all

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:20,530
the cities and then I can go here again

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,180
to that field which is actually that

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,220
field configuration above I can go to

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:26,500
the template options which you have seen

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:30,840
above here and a certain dynamically I

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,840
say options is equal to cities

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:45,400
there's a I'm missing an hour on alright

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:50,210
thanks

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:52,250
perfect you're still awake and left okay

00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,970
so now if I change to Germany it should

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,530
actually switch to the German cities or

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:06,260
Prague made a mistake here let me just

00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:08,690
do a quick hack and do what and so in

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,700
this case basically you can see here I'm

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:13,430
getting here in the nation ID and I'm

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:18,590
getting a citizen theory it was really

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:20,510
right yeah and it switches back in so as

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,920
you can see here in the books basically

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,810
it's the part where you can then connect

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,060
different kind of fields together and

00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:28,550
basically then filter them and also

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,110
apply visibilities another part here

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,090
which is really interesting is these

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,500
expression properties I guess you know

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,630
for instance whatever I want to do is

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,250
when I change here that too empty

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,200
I want to disable a city because it

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,510
doesn't make sense to select the city in

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,100
that case as you can see setting up

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,290
something like that is really simple

00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,510
what you have to do is just disable and

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,850
set the disabled property but in dynamic

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:52,550
way Ike I don't go up here and just set

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,860
hero disabled is equal to true but I

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,360
rather say well use that expression

00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,300
properties which are evaluated at

00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,360
runtime whenever my model changes set on

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,740
the template options that disabled

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,110
whenever the nationally is not selected

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,570
right and so in this case I can already

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:12,950
disabled this part above here last part

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,530
which is interesting also is these phone

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:17,450
numbers as you can see here I have an

00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,040
array of different kind of subtypes

00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,420
which I'll need to generate like these

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,850
former race which you normally have a

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,280
reactive approach as you can see here

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,650
below here what I can do is I can add

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,870
here multiple phone numbers I can here

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,680
just add a plus and add a new one and

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:34,910
bind that in as well and it will then

00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,360
basically be attached to my phone value

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,650
just automatically how does that work

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,230
well what you can do in for me is you

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,910
can create such a repeat type now this

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,220
is something I create basically it's a

00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,640
wrapper around a repeating section which

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,770
formerly already gives you a base

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,900
which you can just extend and tell him

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,580
how it should look like like what kind

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,080
of buttons you want to have here besides

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,640
when you want to have to act when you

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,280
have one I have two plus button and so

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,960
on and then inside there basically you

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,390
have just a normal configuration as we

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,010
had above like you have just a select

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:07,710
box you provide you the options in this

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,900
case I provide them statically or the

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,750
number field just below and this way you

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,120
can hook the things up and last but not

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,010
least obviously also validation like

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,260
validation you can just add here for

00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,570
instance a min validator this should be

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,940
18 you can provide customization

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,340
messages or just at the global level say

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,870
whenever a min validator kicks in I want

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,790
to have that validation message whenever

00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,919
required where the data comes in I want

00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,530
to have that validation message and so

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,140
for instance if I go here like at 40 I

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,350
will get here validation message out

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:44,010
printed out directly so mostly focus is

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:46,740
here on that form configuration part now

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:48,570
let me switch back I have all the slides

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,250
here in between us just jump over them

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,049
this is more for reference material for

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:56,400
you these were basically parts which

00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:57,750
I've I've shown in the demo so these

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,750
were all the parts which you have seen

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,280
just in the demo lifecycle hooks and

00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,919
what is missing is the custom form

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,809
controls right how do custom form

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,669
controls look like because as you can

00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:11,100
imagine of course like we have heard

00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:12,809
today about design systems and if I am

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,090
working in a corporate environment I'm

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,130
probably not having just material or

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,410
bootstrap like the standard ones but I'm

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,169
having a customized UI theme for my

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:23,850
company and so in that case if you can

00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,500
start from some material and extend it

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,200
from there it's more of an advantage

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,720
because you can already take use base go

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,820
off to built-in for many components but

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,590
you can totally create your own

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:37,140
principle I did here is a simple example

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:38,700
I I wanted to have an NG select which

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,490
doesn't yet exist informally because

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,290
it's like the custom component I just

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,390
took that ng select component which

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,330
already exists online in github you can

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,910
install it and have rapid basically how

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:54,419
does that work what you have to do here

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:56,790
is basically you have such a feel time

00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:58,620
which you can inherit from for me like

00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:01,290
imported from for me you create a new

00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,480
component which here wraps that ng

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,630
component or your own company internal

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,370
component whatever you have right and

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,620
then you can pass in a different kind of

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,150
options for instance here this is an

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,500
exploded version of the energy select

00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,690
where they're passing multiple

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,750
properties of that and you can see that

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:21,570
tio dot label or Chioda options or tio

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,220
turbine value that tio sent for the

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,860
template options which we have just seen

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,570
and since I'm inheriting here from feel

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,070
type that can be passed in from formula

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,900
so it's actually very easy to create

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,000
your custom configuration you can even

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,950
add your custom properties because like

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,960
a select box here has something like

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:38,970
your a bind value which in our control

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,620
my don't have so you can form these

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,360
flexible in that way so it has a dynamic

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,380
types of type or you can just add

00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,970
properties on your own you'll finally

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,100
once you have that you register it like

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,020
you tell him okay that type which we

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,090
have seen before how should that be

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,680
called in this case my autocomplete and

00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,690
what component should form instantiate

00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,100
into this component and so with that you

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,140
can create basically your own set of

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,580
libraries and extend formally as you

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,220
want and as you need it inside your

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,010
cooperation and here we see how we can

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,330
use it it's actually exactly the same as

00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:11,160
the Select box right you don't see

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,650
actually much difference from a first

00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,510
look I just exchange you the type with

00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,640
my own and then I have a sign out

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,750
complete type instead of a select box so

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,970
also changing this is quite easy right

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:26,430
an important consideration here so if

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,960
you want to extend your own if you're

00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,090
gonna extend form and create your own

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,550
basically set of components definitely

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:34,050
go into the source code because as you

00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,460
have seen in the start of the

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,280
presentation there are those different

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,570
UI frameworks just look how foaming has

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,400
been implemented for those like for

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,380
material for bootstrap and use it for

00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,720
your own like you just copy that folder

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,590
and adapt it for what you need in your

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,290
own company a final part also is to

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,400
custom yourself like we have planned

00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,720
your forms like in the current

00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,180
application which we are developing we

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,340
have a lot of forms which having forms

00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,670
large forms or users even have to scroll

00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,230
down so what we did there is we didn't

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,520
just use the plain form the

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,160
configuration because as you can imagine

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,350
that gets really huge and also hard to

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,360
maintain after a certain point so we

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,460
implement somehow a custom domain

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,899
specific very end of

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,940
for me so we've wrapped basically the

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:19,529
configuration what we did is for

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,570
instance create a formal service it

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,619
returns that famous formally feel comfy

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,169
couch we have seen which is the original

00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:27,090
formally config but as you can see that

00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,279
the API is much more simple like he will

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,279
have an input a config which is our

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,049
config so we even like limit the

00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:36,570
original formally conflict to what we

00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,730
usually need so that people it is easier

00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,679
for people to get started and that could

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,690
look like this for instance I could say

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,490
for to creating a new form here and

00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,710
uniformly configured just I did start

00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,480
forming which is my service now dot

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,369
input and I just have to pass in those

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,320
key and label I don't have to have too

00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:55,980
nasty and I can adjust it to what I need

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,960
usually my forms right you can even go

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,119
further for instance if that CD I

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,490
deselect is needed in multiple places

00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,799
you just can refactor to something like

00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,600
that right it's in the in the end is

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,029
just a function which you returns a for

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,649
me convict right so you can just compose

00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,990
it in that way and that's also another

00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:15,779
way of how you could reuse parts of

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,580
forms and recompose it right also for

00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:19,379
testing I'm currently experimenting

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,730
around with DES because if you have a

00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,649
component which just returns you're

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,119
forming conflict which actually has much

00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:26,159
of the logic inside there like how

00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,529
fields are hidden shown based on other

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,149
fields based on inputs I'm doing HP cost

00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,110
and so on you can actually just create a

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:32,850
generic component

00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,830
fetch the configuration load it into

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:37,049
your test component test it there also

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,059
Maya just three four fields in isolation

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:43,230
and so that makes unit testing a lot

00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:45,539
easier as well so in general it helps

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,399
that DSL to have that repetitive for me

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,289
conflict which over time you definitely

00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,970
get because it's quite huge because it's

00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:53,789
general-purpose so you can just

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,889
basically I reuse it by tailoring it

00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:58,320
down into your own service and creating

00:25:55,889 --> 00:25:59,999
your custom configuration house it's

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,110
easier to handle potentially breaking

00:25:59,999 --> 00:26:03,539
changes which you never know where they

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,279
come the author really does an awesome

00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,860
job also providing now upgrade

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,570
schematics for latest version to do the

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,749
migration when there are breaking

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,789
changes and there's much more so there's

00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:16,409
much more stuff as well like we have

00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:18,179
seen for instance that repeats a bit but

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:21,179
you could actually create tapped forms

00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,850
or forms with data tables or nested

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,440
forms flex based layouts also that Jason

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,100
powered forms with Jason power forms

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,990
would actually be the parlor

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,370
ever returns how the form should look

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,080
like because the server actually knows

00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:34,059
how the model looks like and how

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,010
basically the form should look like so

00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,289
in some cases or really need that

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,970
flexibility where maybe you user can

00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:41,799
define what fields should be shown and

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,260
what not you could actually go into that

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:45,690
direction and return the entire forma

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,130
confirmation from the server side

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,110
definitely go to that URL down here

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,820
there are a lot of example who stack

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,070
plates this link so you can actually go

00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,570
there choose the example you want open a

00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,460
stack place and play around with it copy

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,000
it over to your project and and go ahead

00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,429
so did a really good job there in

00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,260
implementing that Ram is a cool line you

00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,960
probably know him is very active in the

00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,539
community he's also a huge for me addict

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,850
he now works at Stack peas as well so he

00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:14,950
he's a huge contributors of for me and

00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,679
supporter and he said basically he is

00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:20,289
using it whenever he can and what I

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,740
suggest is basically to conclude a whole

00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:25,659
part is there once you have the initial

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,730
setup which might depending on how we

00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:30,250
customized your company internal

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:32,289
frameworks UI library and so on is it

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,460
might take a bit more time initially but

00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:34,990
once you have your building blocks

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,669
you're really fast to create forms

00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,190
especially forms that have a lot of

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:41,169
dependencies between them especially due

00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,390
to that observer support because the

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:45,610
server support allows us to hide fields

00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,559
based on observers emitting and so on so

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:50,799
it gets really really powerful in the

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,390
end I wouldn't suggest it necessarily if

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,730
you have a lot of different kind of

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,890
forms like if every form you have is

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,390
really different to the artist like if

00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,980
you don't have kind of a start flowing

00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,260
through your application but maybe mix

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:04,059
with tables and stuff then Foom we might

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,919
not help you that much like you can

00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,840
still use it but you might not get

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,620
advantage that huge advantage of that

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,150
speed would you might get out of it

00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,940
great I would like to really thank that

00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,909
guy because he's the main brain behind

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:21,010
njx for me he's the core maintainer and

00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:23,530
he does an awesome job like whenever you

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:25,179
have some issues on github just open

00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,830
them up like in a couple of hours

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:28,480
they're probably closed or with the

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:31,600
solution provided so that's an awesome

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,700
job on that library if you have quests

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,560
of course I can ask now or reach out

00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:40,859
later Mike is already coming thank you

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,859
