I just feel like it's a very community

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,910
driven conference it also is a lot of

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,769
quality and people are just nice hi my

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,730
name's Sarah and this is agent comp in

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,420
Dortmund

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,099
[Music]

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,500
amazing venue Austria is beautiful

00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:25,300
meeting all the people in the community

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:32,509
and getting to go and hang out and ski

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:36,449
[Music]

00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,449
[Applause]

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:45,519
okay we're going we're live doing alive

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,920
great so super excited to be here it is

00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:50,680
my first time in Austria I'm from

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,449
California in the US and it is very cold

00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,739
here and fun fact I when I get nervous I

00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,210
get really cold and now it's already

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,330
really cold here so I'm just gonna be

00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,979
like shaking so much so that's why you

00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,239
know because it's cold here but we're

00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:07,240
here to talk about react native and

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,880
accessibility I decided to do kind of an

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,009
intro beginner-friendly kind of this

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:16,090
because there's not that many accessible

00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:18,550
apps out there and not sure why I feel

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:23,140
like it needs to be more ingrained from

00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:24,970
the beginning so if you need a closer

00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:29,680
look at these slides in my speaker notes

00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,930
bitly slash react native 11y le did a

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,840
great explanation on numeron 'm which is

00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:37,960
for i 18 9 so we have a 11 y for

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,270
accessibility so those are available if

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,770
you need a closer look all my links will

00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:45,550
be there so be sure to check that out

00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,990
also tweet it out afterwards little

00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,360
introductions

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,090
I'm Erin Fox I hang out on Twitter as

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,860
Erin Fox with two O's people call me

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,070
like Erin Fuchs which is kind of weird

00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,170
but it works I'm a software engineer at

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:02,200
the wing it's a network of community and

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,690
workspaces designed for a woman and we

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,570
believe that when women gather you go

00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,759
further faster together and right now

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,069
I'm over there working on brand-new

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,629
Android app and react native I've

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,489
historically worked with react native

00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,379
before in the past but I never really

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:21,310
got the opportunity to really dive into

00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,659
accessibility before and so his talk was

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,359
such a great opportunity for me to

00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,620
research more and learn more about the

00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:28,269
drawbacks and the

00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:32,170
great things that react native has to

00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:33,970
offer so a little outline we're gonna

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,640
dive into what accessibility is I know

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,549
if we all have a new bright idea of what

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,319
it is but we're going to narrow it down

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:43,599
we'll talk about designing apps with

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,269
accessibility in mind and then we'll

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,069
focus specifically on react native and

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,900
dive a little into their documentation I

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:55,510
keep bouncing and then everything's

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:57,129
bouncing so cats I love cats so

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,430
obviously I need to talk a little bit

00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:03,310
about that I've built a small little

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,040
basic sloppy react native app and Expo

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,370
and we'll get into that which will be

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,750
fun and exciting demo near the middle

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,220
and then we'll lunch which is exciting

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,260
because the sandwiches yesterday we're

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,980
pretty good hopefully they're equally

00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,629
it's good so I like to ask a ton of

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,159
questions I feel like I'm always that

00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,349
junior on the team that asks so many

00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,819
questions that I mean I do my research

00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,849
and at Google and then I'll come ask you

00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:30,849
a question but I like to ask a lot so I

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:34,060
think as we will discuss further like

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:36,940
what accessibility is it's like why

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:41,099
should we make applications accessible

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:43,930
it can be a very complex question and

00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,180
but why like why aren't we building them

00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,760
why are we building them to make it more

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,280
accessible to more people and notice I

00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,500
don't say make it accessible to everyone

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,030
I think that's near impossible I think

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,400
if you know your product and you know

00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,669
your users and you do that extensive

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,169
research to know your users

00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,790
that's who you're trying to target not

00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,560
everyone you're trying to target your

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,879
essential users that you're going for

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,889
and some managers her team leads might

00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:15,010
not even have accessibility across their

00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,510
mind they might say well why do we need

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,880
to add accessibility I mean our apps

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,380
fast we have a ton of users it's going

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,030
very great it's not really on the

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:28,150
business plan I've heard that a few

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:30,669
times not that great and from my

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,650
experience once they do jump on board

00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:34,449
they will add it not from the beginning

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,849
but like down like building the boat as

00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:38,890
you're going which is great it's always

00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:40,480
amazing to add more accessibility but

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:44,920
it's so much easier to

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,260
from the beginning so the goal for the

00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,140
next 30 ish minutes is I don't have a

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,400
drone sorry I should put that out there

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:55,630
we're not doing accessibility drone

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,760
today but really is to just inspire you

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:01,150
and introduce best practices best

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,370
practices for writing accessible react

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,380
native apps and really to realize that

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,990
you can't build the perfect most

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,880
accessible app it's researching and

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,140
learning and doing the best you can for

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,570
your users with accessibility and Kath

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,040
Holmes who is a designer and engineer at

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,310
Google I think really said it

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,680
beautifully she says we start thinking

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,050
and designing for inclusion and we will

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,820
start to recognize exclusion and that's

00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,920
a lot of where my inspiration for this

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,010
talk came from is her book called

00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,690
mismatched how inclusion shapes designs

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,460
it's on Amazon it's a great read it

00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,770
really opened my eyes to accessibility

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,560
also with design and code and like on

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,770
the outside world and one thing that she

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,130
talks about is she kind of reward the

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,780
word accessibility as to a mismatch so

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,490
we have all these different mismatches

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,740
in our lives that our disability but

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:56,050
we're gonna call it mismatches so I was

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,090
in Munich earlier this month or week I

00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,190
wasn't here for a month a week and I'm

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,650
trying to order beer I'm trying to order

00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,480
food and I don't speak the language so

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,430
that it was a mismatch situation or if

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,690
you break your arm and you only have one

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,520
arm till I can answer your phone you

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,080
can't really hit that top button to

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,670
answer it's like okay I'm just not going

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,500
to answer this phone call so that's a

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,860
mismatch situation it's temporarily

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,050
disabled it's just there's so many

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,660
different mismatches out there that were

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:31,210
maybe not thinking of and now's the time

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:33,310
to really start thinking of it so what

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,720
is accessibility and I thought I were to

00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,780
go around the room and ask all of you

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,150
what accessibility is we'd have hundreds

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,390
of different answers let's try and

00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:45,700
narrow it down a little bit so the most

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,530
common ones of accessibility maybe that

00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,030
you think of is someone could be blind

00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:54,249
vision impaired deaf color blind or

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,929
maybe similar you might have

00:06:54,249 --> 00:07:00,129
that might come to mind when you think

00:06:55,929 --> 00:07:03,159
of it but not now it's like okay this

00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:06,189
disabled I'm very disabled but how does

00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:08,859
this affect the way that I code having

00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:10,569
contrasting colors creating components

00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:13,089
that are compatible with voiceover for

00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:16,509
iOS or talkback for Android the list

00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:18,189
really can go on just by knowing again

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:21,039
your users in your product and knowing

00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:22,479
if your users need to be or have talked

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,029
back to are done on their phone you need

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,949
to be able to label your components with

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:30,749
properties so the talkback actually

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:33,399
works there's also many unpopular I

00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:35,529
should say there's just also like life

00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,209
circumstances you're holding a child

00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,229
trying to hit that phone call button

00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:39,219
there you trying to reject that phone

00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,219
call button because you don't want to

00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:44,979
answer you're unable to you wear glasses

00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:48,099
so maybe you like zoom in super close I

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:51,069
think my parents have the maximum font

00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:54,159
on every app that they have which kind

00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:57,789
of makes the design ugly in some apps if

00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:01,599
it's not accessible for you you break

00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:04,629
your arm internationalization i-89 I 18

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,979
and that Ellie went over great it's just

00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:11,319
really it's knowing that there's more

00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:14,499
that are not similar to what you have

00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,269
and another thing about accessibility is

00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:18,669
I've never seen it required in

00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:20,139
curriculum before I'm a boot camp brat

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,789
so I had about three months of web

00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,829
development experience before getting my

00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:25,929
first job and I had about an hour of

00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:29,049
accessibility on what it was and I just

00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:31,389
blew by my head so I think we really

00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:33,250
need to break the habit of putting it

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:35,649
off and not making it a priority when

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,139
we're educating it's important to set

00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:40,649
aside time for your team to be able to

00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:43,930
look up documentation learn your users

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:47,199
and just continually ask who is unable

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:51,250
to access my product and my from my code

00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:52,809
is really critical for accessibility so

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,809
now we're going to get into some facts I

00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:58,180
love some facts so according to the

00:08:55,809 --> 00:09:01,329
World Health Organization 1 billion or

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:04,660
15% of the world's population experience

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:07,120
some form of disability and so there are

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,080
over six point four billion people who

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,840
are temporarily

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,120
able-bodied like 6.4 billion people is a

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,770
lot of people in the world who can't or

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,290
might not be able to use your product

00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,860
that's a huge market that you're already

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:24,210
missing out on and so it's incredibly

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,780
difficult like doing more with less but

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,700
the design that works for greater more

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,310
diverse portion of the population and

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,750
kind of that's why we're here I mean a

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,240
few of you might be here just to go

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,150
skiing which fair enough but we're gonna

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,440
sneak in some knowledge before that

00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,210
we're just as engineers we're

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,040
continuously growing I feel like if

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,680
you're not open to learning new things

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,780
you kind of stunt your career and so

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,280
learning and accessibility is a great

00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,350
outlet for you to be able to expand

00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,750
yourself make your team better make your

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,460
product better and also just add it to

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,150
your resume to make you just a more

00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:04,020
well-rounded engineer and so later on

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:06,670
I'll show you my small little cat app

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,440
but I think a good thing to know is like

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,510
there's always room for improvement and

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,410
even if you have zero accessibility on

00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:16,120
your app right now fine like there's so

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,740
many more options and so much research

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,840
that you can do to add it I feel like

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,740
it's a very feel-good thing to be like

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,360
my app is accessible which great but and

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,300
then I feel like sometimes if it isn't

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,340
accessible you hide in the shadows

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,930
whatever there's always room for

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,120
improvement it's never going to be

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:37,390
perfect and there's always a chance for

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,400
you to add accessibility to your app so

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,470
we'll dive specifically into mobile apps

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,720
so where do we start so I think before

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,330
this it really starts with who you hire

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,180
on your team and so if you hire and

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:54,730
create a diverse team you really do gain

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,860
more insights from them who may have

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,050
likely experienced different kinds of

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,820
exclusions from yourself then you'll

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,860
educate the team he'll give them time as

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,200
I mentioned to learn accessibility have

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,720
times to practice it look at open source

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,930
projects around it so hire a diverse

00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,820
team understand your users have time to

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,810
practice and learn within your team and

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:20,170
it really will expand your experiences

00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,640
to gain more empathy for others and I'm

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,970
not telling you how exactly to make your

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,910
app

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,889
accessible but if you're never if you're

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,019
not aware of these issues then it might

00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:33,009
not have come to you from the beginning

00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:34,740
and so where do we all start well

00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,569
hopefully most of us start with

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,759
documentation I hated documentation for

00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:43,389
so long until I found some good ones and

00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:45,279
then loved it so once we're all on board

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:47,050
we're gonna look at some docs so

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,699
surprise Android accessibility

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,160
documentation they have a great

00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:55,180
fantastic site where they do a lot of

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,490
announcements of new features coming out

00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,050
like live captioning they have really

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,819
well-written blog posts so if you're

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,649
using react native you're definitely

00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:04,689
need to check out different devices that

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,730
you'll be using it on so Android

00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:10,089
accessibility documentation is a great

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,759
start if you haven't played around with

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:16,329
your accessibility features on Android

00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,889
it's a little tricky definitely if you

00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:19,300
are designing an app and you need it to

00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:22,480
be accessible which you should have it

00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,189
accessible please check this out an

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,319
example would be like I need to turn on

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:28,420
my screen reader so when I tap on

00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,680
something tap on a header if I'm vision

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,199
impaired and I need to know what it says

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,910
I'll tap on the header and it will the

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:38,079
voiceover I should say talkback for

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:40,600
Android will read it back to me so but

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,209
with that they the user will really rely

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,160
on your code to have to have these

00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:48,399
features into order for talkback to work

00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,959
so labeling your components is essential

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,709
which we'll get into soon and very

00:12:49,959 --> 00:13:00,129
important and surprise iOS accessibility

00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:01,809
so very Apple II documentation very

00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:06,699
white and clean looking check it out

00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:08,860
learn all the terms again go on your

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,629
iPhone accessibility features you could

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,670
turn on hints here you could turn off in

00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:14,139
so you could do inverted colors I used

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,059
to do that and think I was very cool and

00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,689
have all these weird colors but it's

00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:21,610
actually for vision impaired individuals

00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:23,350
you could font size zoom magnification

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,470
you could literally change your entire

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,550
app you can change your entire phone and

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,589
users might be doing this with your

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,480
product name you might not even know it

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:34,540
and they can't use it so you're creating

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,830
separation for your users of feeling

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,630
left out and

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:42,550
being able to use it of course the react

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,440
native accessibility documentation I

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,060
don't believe you can build an

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,550
accessible react native app without

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,130
coming here a few times we'll be looking

00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:54,190
at as specific of these examples coming

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,570
up but hopefully this is very beginner

00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,510
friendly obviously check out the

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,130
documentation know the documents and the

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,050
devices that you're working on which

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,550
will really help you understand how to

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,340
turn on and off features when you're

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:10,140
developing a react native app I found

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:13,780
this really cool poster on gov dot uk'

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:17,410
it's from the department of home digital

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,360
a home office digital it's in ten

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,310
different languages they've really

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,960
provided just a great introduction I

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,600
know it's very hard to see the link is

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,140
in my notes but some examples would be

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:34,300
say you have like a child's children's

00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:35,950
reading app and maybe one of the users

00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,100
the children are on the autistic

00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:41,040
spectrum so you will have to do specific

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,140
things within your app to help it more

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,450
usable so it's like best to describe

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,790
buttons like having attached files

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,460
instead of saying click me so be easier

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:55,360
for the user a child in this aspect

00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:57,910
example to use the product we also might

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,950
have a user who has some form of

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:05,980
dyslexia so using understanding that

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,390
lists of words having images and

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,840
diagrams are better than listing words

00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,670
and understand that underlining texts

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,590
align everything allows for a better

00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,660
comprehension so again just really

00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:19,150
understanding your user and being able

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,210
to change your code and your design to

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:26,500
fit with what they need is a huge part

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:29,970
of it so we'll dive into react native

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,740
accessibility so the react native

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,050
includes API designed really to provide

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,290
developers with support for making more

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:41,440
accessible apps and Android and iOS

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,890
different slightly with but their

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,090
approaches but react native really has

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,610
implementations that vary for each of

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,790
them and so there's different bundles

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,800
for iOS and

00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:55,160
Android they're just different assistive

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:57,770
technologies that allow for like screen

00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,780
reader for voiceover for iOS and

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,260
talkback for Android which I'm focusing

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:06,500
a little bit leaning on that way and

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:08,600
then it lets you look at component

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,150
examples of the react native properties

00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,310
so let's dive into that so the first one

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,350
here we just have a basic view on line

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,850
one where that star is so anytime you

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,550
see a star that will be what we're

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:23,510
focusing on we have a view and we have

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:26,630
accessible is true so when a view is an

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,280
accessible element it groups its

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,700
children into a single selected

00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:34,040
component and by default all touchable

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,660
elements are accessible I've added them

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,420
throughout on mine too but it's good to

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,670
note that all touchable are defaulted to

00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,890
true for accessibility and on Android

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,110
accessibility equals true will be

00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:49,790
translated natively to focusable equals

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,530
true so a little twist there and so we

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:55,100
get a focus on a parent view on the

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:57,920
accessible property we'll go through a

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:00,140
couple more so accessibility label press

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,300
me so now we have a touchable opacity I

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,710
have the accessibility equals true even

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,860
though it's defaulted true I just want

00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,390
to green that in your minds so our label

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,339
here will be pressed me it looks like we

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,589
have it on press we got some texts and

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,959
we have our touchable opacity so when a

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,220
view is marked as accessible it's good

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,079
practice to set an accessibility label

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,209
on the view so that people with

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:26,570
voiceover will have something to further

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,550
talk back to them voiceover will read

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,770
the string when the user selects the

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,570
element so the way voiceover works if

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,640
you have a screen and you have a header

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,130
if you have voiceover turned on on your

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,740
device for iOS if you tap once it will

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,030
read press me and then if you tap it

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,580
again it will actually perform that

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,320
action so understanding how that works

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,450
and understanding having a label makes

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,950
it able for your user to use it hints

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:55,670
accessibility hint I always love a good

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:57,890
hint so a new gift will show on every

00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,270
press we have our touchable opacity we

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,520
have accessible it's true even though

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,650
the touch rules are always true we have

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,060
our labels so

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,860
this really helps you user understand

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,260
what will happen when they perform an

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,050
action on an accessibility element

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:15,080
element when that result is not apparent

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,970
from the accessibility label so you can

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,220
turn on and off hints on your device

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,830
right now you cannot turn it off on

00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,040
Android so it will be reading it on

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,380
Android so voice over will read the hint

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,720
after the label so we'll talk back and

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,190
if the user has the hint enabled on

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,790
their phone so if it's not on the able

00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:37,360
to on their phone

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:40,700
it won't read if it is it will read role

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,890
so for this touchable opacity the button

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,990
a little self-explanatory so the

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,320
property communicates the purpose of the

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,580
component to the user and there are many

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,400
many options that you could do with an

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,590
accessibility role literally a screen

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,380
shot from the documentation you can have

00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,150
keyboard text adjustable button there's

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,550
many many that you see if there's one

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,260
that you don't see maybe create a PR to

00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,610
the react native thing and add it and

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:09,530
get approved and then it will be on

00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:11,870
there open-source so there's that for

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,450
that one and then this one's pretty cool

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,190
so accessibility ignore inverted colors

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,200
I don't know I always would like change

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,560
my inverted colors like felt cool and

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,150
different this was like before dark mode

00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,820
so I took these images from Daniel Dan's

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,310
article which is also linked here and so

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,740
when you change your settings so this

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,990
one would be an iOS features two

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,360
inverted colors you'll see that you'll

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,950
go from this white background gold

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,540
Hamilton image you have this kind of

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,760
blue touchable button at the bottom

00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,930
they'll turn on your inverted colors and

00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,700
then we kind of have this like creepy

00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,460
photo and then you have this blue

00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,110
Hamilton and the button and so say we

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,420
didn't want to have our image to have

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,090
inverted colors because if I'm vision

00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:55,040
impaired I know what my profile photo

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,080
will look like and so I'll set

00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,080
accessibility ignore invert colors on my

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,970
image tag equals true for my photo so

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,490
everything else will be inverted except

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,710
for my photo so if you have a profile on

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,500
your app and people are inverting their

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,410
colors it's good to kind of keep the

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,070
image as they expect it to be so this is

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,450
one way that you're able to do that

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,809
there's also accessibility

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,730
EMBO and so this helps you get the

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:26,720
current various statuses of these users

00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:29,240
device for both Android and iOS and so

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,010
you can even track it as it changes and

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,470
you can add these as event listeners to

00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:36,080
your initial state or your use effect or

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,029
your component did mount so you can tell

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,029
and actually get feedback if your users

00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,110
are using a screen reader or they are

00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:44,000
building their texts that they are

00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,789
zooming in so this is a way to learn

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,889
more about how they're using their own

00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:56,419
devices with your app cool example time

00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:59,059
so when I was in between jobs I really

00:20:56,419 --> 00:21:01,330
needed to understand react hooks and so

00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:06,429
kind of led me to build this

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:11,899
little app so it started off as a random

00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:13,309
cat gif app because I love cats um I

00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:14,539
have one cat I've been told you're not

00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:16,820
allowed to have to because then that

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:19,220
makes it crazy so I'm only allowed to

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,010
have one but a little walkthrough of

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,139
what we have so we have a big title at

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,690
the top we have this image which is

00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:29,960
initially a gif and then we have this

00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,639
new gift please button that we have down

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,529
here and then we have this picker at the

00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:36,590
bottom that has cats dogs and there is

00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:39,590
an option for bunnies so initially I

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,679
started I just was like cats rule and I

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,059
was mentoring with I was pairing with a

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,760
mentor and they're like you know and

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:49,370
everybody really likes cats broke my

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,110
heart so I had to add some options of

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,539
dogs and bunnies I'm not gonna show you

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:57,139
the bunnies because even though they get

00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:58,970
github or the giffy API has ratings it's

00:21:57,139 --> 00:22:00,980
like borderline inappropriate at times

00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:09,399
so we're gonna stick with the cats and

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:14,510
the dogs so let's hope this is working

00:22:09,399 --> 00:22:17,419
walk through it it's also a very fun app

00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,370
to build for myself because I would just

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:23,000
keep clicking the button over and over

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:27,080
again which I didn't you'll see I didn't

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,389
get much done cool okay so we have our

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,310
random gif app we can hit new gift

00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:35,150
please oh

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:37,850
yes mustache so you see it gets very

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,760
distracting I'll walk through the code

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:44,660
with you all again oh I should point out

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:49,040
there's only one user main user focus

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,290
and that's me so for me accessibility I

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,050
just wanted to play around with it and

00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,400
learn it there's not really a single

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:59,150
user because I'm the user and I like

00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,640
cats so I've cat app so yeah so we kind

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:06,680
of go through we have a lot of our tag

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:09,190
which we have fetching with our gift VIP

00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:11,660
I keep saying github API it's gif EAP I

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:15,950
don't steal my key please we're all nice

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:19,340
people and see how I have PG not really

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,230
PG for the bunnies so we won't be

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,990
looking at those ones and so we'll jump

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:28,540
down to our JSX here let me get rid of

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:31,970
this and I'll zoom in let's look at this

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:34,460
touchable opacity here so we have

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:36,140
accessible is true I know I mentioned a

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,490
few times it's always true so I don't

00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,370
necessarily need to have it here but I

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,540
added it here to help you remember we're

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:44,000
looking so it's going to be this little

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,670
pink new gift button please on the app

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,130
and it's the roll accessibility roll is

00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,230
a button and then we have pressed me for

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:54,080
a new gif as the label we have

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,600
accessibility hint as a new gift will

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,610
show on every press and then we have

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,970
some text we have some text down there

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,350
and then that's kind of our touchable

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,840
opacity there with our accessibility

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,820
elements on it and I added some other

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,060
ones within our image I think one thing

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,710
that's important to call out is if you

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,110
are vision impaired you might not

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,600
necessarily go to this app because it's

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,600
just looking at gifts but if you're

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,790
interested in it I added the image title

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,010
so it will say will show the voiceover

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,590
in a moment it will be like moustache

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,060
cat image so we'll have the title of the

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,770
tag that's coming back from the JSON

00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,020
object so we're able to have like some

00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:37,430
form of voiceover description if you are

00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:42,740
vision impaired so let's try it

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:49,370
I'm gonna have sound I hope we'll find

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:55,940
out okay so I usually open my Xcode and

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:58,750
then we have Xcode developer tools and

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,940
the accessibility inspector and so

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,930
typically the way that this would work

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,910
we're gonna hit my simulator for that is

00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:10,370
in a real lunch situation I would just

00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,920
have a voiceover enabled on my iOS

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,220
device I would tap random give up and it

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:20,540
would say random like robot voice random

00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,920
gift app header um and so what we're

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,179
doing with the accessibility inspector

00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,370
it's just gonna like run through it

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:28,820
pretty quickly so I'll let it go a few

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:44,620
times and hopefully we have some sound

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:44,620
here no sound no worries maybe it's me

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,900
well I could I do a great robot voice

00:25:53,290 --> 00:26:12,590
let's see yeah adjustable random header

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:15,410
gif image press me for a new gift button

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,920
cats adjustable gnome I don't get that

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:22,940
header cat gif image press me for a new

00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:26,240
gift button cats adjustable random okay

00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,620
so it goes pretty fast but you can see

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,750
based on what I've added with the

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,520
accessibility label the hint um you can

00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,920
say it's a button you could cure it's

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,780
just a cat gif let's see what this one

00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,200
says sometimes the titles are really

00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:41,559
long which are funny cat gif image thank

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,730
you for a new gift button cats

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:51,610
adjustable random give up header cool so

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:53,900
we kind of get the gist of that um and

00:26:51,610 --> 00:27:02,750
pretty cool you could clap I mean that'd

00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:04,370
be nice okay so say we wanted to take

00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,870
that a step further we have our

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,390
touchable opacity here and these are

00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,270
like kind of long and sometimes I might

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,850
forget to add one you can pull them out

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,740
and maybe to like accessible components

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,780
so let's keep looking at this button

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:21,530
here we have may be accessible button

00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:24,650
and so I'm gonna say for iOS we're gonna

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,110
do this and then if it's not iOS we're

00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:28,850
gonna do Android we're gonna do this

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,770
because some props work on certain

00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,440
devices so that's why I'm just splitting

00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:36,380
them out for to for now and then we'll

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,540
say touchable opacity accessible is true

00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,900
hint we'll do props out hint props that

00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,060
label props up roll we'll get some props

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,440
not children in there so then when we

00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:51,020
are able and want to render it we can do

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,150
it this way so we just say role equals

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:56,929
button or label equals press me for a

00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,940
new guess so this would kind of like

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:00,560
it's like a sneaky little way sneaky way

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,490
of doing accessibility when you don't

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,620
really know that you're doing

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,320
accessibility so be able to have these

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,590
components from the start about project

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,720
is I think a really great aspect to have

00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,220
in there so you already have accessible

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,390
components from the beginning you just

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,250
have to say it roll you don't even have

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,340
to type out the whole thing so being

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:21,800
able to pull out these accessibility

00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:27,020
features for your components is a fun

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:32,630
little trick alright so what are the

00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:34,730
next steps hired for diversity have

00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,610
everyone on your team project manners

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:41,360
higher-ups

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:43,580
managers just really be aware of the

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,919
plan of who your users are what

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,780
accessibility features you need your QA

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,620
team isn't just there to click around

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,300
and do buttons

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:54,200
they can also be running accessibility

00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:56,810
features as well be aware of the process

00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,000
do your research let's kick the habit

00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,160
and and if you speak or you teach anyone

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,700
teach them to do accessibility this is

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,260
was a small tiny app

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,510
I wanted to have accessibility in it

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:10,230
maybe even when you're doing a small one

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,000
add those features there as well do your

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,550
research look at those Doc's know your

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,610
users build the skills and just really

00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,530
make accessible apps and open source

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,480
your code if you open source your code

00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,360
maybe there's an accessibility feature

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,830
that I need that is not on your app

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,630
maybe you're not putting the role on all

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,120
your apps and I want to add them to your

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,740
app and it's a great way to even get

00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,810
introduced and start to do open source

00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,880
and contribute to it so definitely check

00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,440
out documentation if there's something

00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,570
there that you need or that your your

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,190
users need contribute to open source

00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:46,410
it's a win-win um do a workshop so on

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:49,080
front-end masters Marci C does an

00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:51,180
amazing talk accessibility in JavaScript

00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,030
applications she covers how to debug it

00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,220
on for web and for accessibility and

00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:58,230
manual automated testing it's incredible

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,300
highly recommend you checking it out

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:02,580
maybe if like workshops aren't your

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,580
thing you can watch some YouTube

00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,720
everybody loves a good YouTube talk

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,800
Annika gave a talk last year at react

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,810
Amsterdam called

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,360
make your react native apps accessible

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,010
the link will be in my speaker notes so

00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,040
definitely it's a great one I would

00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:19,260
highly recommend checking it out and

00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,420
then if workshops watching videos aren't

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,170
your thing maybe you couldn't read some

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:27,300
so Lorraine has written amazing articles

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,070
about mobile accessibility resources and

00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,420
creating an inclusive apps so please

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:34,890
check that out

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,870
and so in conclusion I guess kind of to

00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,360
wrap it all up because I hear a little

00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,430
rustle and we're getting hungry let's

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,900
start designing from the beginning and

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:47,730
kollene accessible react native apps so

00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,360
you hopefully have an idea of where to

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,620
start

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,400
you saw that there's voiceover

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:55,170
capabilities as long as you kind of have

00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,110
a direction an idea this in your mind

00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,300
that's all I really hope for I think

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,160
Holmes said it very thoughtfully as it's

00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,900
an opportunity to be curious and

00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,140
approached challenges with a desire to

00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,940
learn and by being here and actively

00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,530
listening and participating and watching

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,630
and engaging I think is the start to

00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,620
considering accessibility and like

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,390
proactively

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,930
really what this presentation is trying

00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,430
to accomplish so again thank you so much

00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,770
for having me thank you for for being

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,110
here and just by being here really is a

00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:31,250
step for a more inclusive online world

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:31,250
so thank you

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,029
