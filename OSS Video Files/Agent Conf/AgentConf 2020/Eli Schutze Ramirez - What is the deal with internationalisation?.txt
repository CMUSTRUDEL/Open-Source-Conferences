little feel how many people here are

00:00:52,680 --> 00:01:01,269
developers okay how many of you have

00:00:57,729 --> 00:01:03,820
made a website what about like a mobile

00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,409
app like iOS Android ok overachievers

00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,860
fine

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,130

all right you can do it all great I

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,479

is a bank in the UK but it's not like a

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,990
regular bank it's a cool bank um my

Ellie belly bonus points for anyone who

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,440
can get me up here looking professional

00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,710
to show to my parents and then tweet it

00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,340
at me

00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,860
um and over here in the corner is my

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,620
life in emoji and I'm not a narcissist I

00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:42,100
promise this is important later but I

00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:45,700
was born in Mexico kind of an accident

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,820
but here we are I grew up in Nicaragua I

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,909
then moved to the United States to do a

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:55,030
bachelor's degree during which I did a

00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:57,850
term abroad in China and Shanghai and

00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,310
very cool and now I live in London in

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,530
the UK just around the corner for those

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,350
of you that were wondering that's where

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,360
Nicaragua is it's a country in Central

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,810
America and that's where we are roughly

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,980
right now so far I miss my family and

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,870
I'm here to talk to you about

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,360
internationalization which I had to

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,900
practice a lot for this talk how to say

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,109
it what is the deal with it what's going

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,260
on what do we need to know has anyone

00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:30,810
here try to internationalize an app

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:33,549
I can see it's a piece of cake right

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,769
just kidding it's very complex and very

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,510
hard and you can mess it up a lot so I

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:39,250
just want to show you a couple things

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,400
that will make you prepared to

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,599
internationalize basically any website

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,459
we're gonna talk about acronyms and

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,640
standards is gonna be a super-fun Ryan

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:50,489
so you know get ready all right the

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,569
first thing I want to talk about is this

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,480
internationalization is often written as

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,010
I 18 n and I just want to make sure

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,220
we're all on the same page about that

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,030
this is called a new mer in him which is

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,670
a number based word for example numbers

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:11,489
as sounds like canine from police dog

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:15,220
units or later from texting I guess

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:18,280
numbers as meaning double-oh-seven is

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,780
James Bond 24/7 means 24 hours seven

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,209
days a week

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,470
9-1-1 is often emergency numbers even if

00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,739
that's not the actual number people

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,060
still like write that for some reason

00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,109
also adding up the number of letters

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,190
between the first and last and then

00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,199
using that number instead of the middle

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,410
of the word wow what a good idea

00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:38,889
which you may have seen in stuff like

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:41,079
accessibility which is a 11 Y or l10n

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:44,459
which is localization and then just as a

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:46,720
bonus this is the numeron m4 numeron him

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,419
in case you ever see that out in the

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,030
wild cool so what is

00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:53,769
internationalization how is it important

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,959
why is it important and how can I get

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,180
all of you to care so much about it like

00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:01,299
I do um so I turned to my most trusted

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,470
advisor to see how I could convince you

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:12,250
that this is so important and I found

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:15,250
statistics on be left here is roughly

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,049
the language of websites in the world

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,979
this is like the top billion or

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:23,470
something and then on the right is

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:25,539
Internet users by language so languages

00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,570
of websites is about 52% English

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:30,280
followed far-far second by Russian

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,729
Internet users is about 26% English

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,680
followed closely by Chinese and we're

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,800
all smart people here you will notice

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,819
that these do not match and that

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
that's really where the problem begins

00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:45,340
and this is why I find this so

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,159
interesting internationalization is

00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,680
essentially a part of accessibility as a

00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,970
web developer if you don't international

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,979
your site you're essentially shutting

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,710
some people out more people are coming

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,720
online every day in the world and it's

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,210
not usually like the majority

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,280
english-speaking crowds because the

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,800
Internet is mostly in English it's

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,870
usually people in like Indonesia and you

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,250
know that kind of sort of like

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:15,250
developing country thing so this topic

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,919
is has been super fun for me to learn

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,690
about I know it's not as cutting edge as

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,690
forms but it's still very important

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:26,229
first to learn about it so let's hit it

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,389
I found this online which I thought was

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:31,090
actually the best definition from w3c

00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,620
standards if you international eyes you

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,409
design or develop your content

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,000
application specifications so on in a

00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,860
way that ensures that it works well for

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,710
or can be easily adapted for users from

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,550
any culture region or language to

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,009
important things here one is the can be

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,849
easily adapted for part a lot of people

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,039
when I talk to them about

00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:54,520
internationalization they go I'm a

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,860
startup I can't afford that or do I need

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,259
to get a translator what's the deal the

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:02,440
truth is the internationalization is a

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,210
way to build your code it doesn't mean

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,659
you have to get a translator right away

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,520
it means that your code is flexible to

00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:12,969
be able to be changed to different

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,710
regions and then culture region or

00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:16,270
language is very important because

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:18,789
internationalization is not just about

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,080
translation there's a ton to think about

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:25,020
which we'll cover later and it's easy to

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,029
miss a lot of it

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,009
usually when you international eyes you

00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:33,039
write your code for your website and

00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:35,050
then maybe where you have a string

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,659
instead of writing the string you put in

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,819
a placeholder that points to like a JSON

00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:42,490
file somewhere Sara loves Jason by the

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,529
way I don't know if you know that with

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,750
all of your string resources in that

00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,940
file that means that when you want to

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,830
add a second language you can just point

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,620
your strings to a second file and boom

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,240
it just changes it so that's sort of

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,660
like the rough thing so for example if

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,020
you had a big JSON you with ID strings

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,520
maybe for a forum you can just refer to

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,740
them by their ID rather than their

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,260
content and then you can just swap out

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,480
the resource files as an example and

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,360
then this is sort of the bigger version

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,310
of that and you can do it in templating

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,550
languages you can do it and react and

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,500
you can do it in plain old JavaScript so

00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,650
whatever your flavor

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,630
it's not hard to internationalize to

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,160
start with so what do we have to think

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,240
about when we internationalize first as

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,570
language is sort of the most obvious

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,720
thing that people jump to writing system

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:43,060
and line breaks not everybody or rights

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,400
with ABCs you got time you got Chinese

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,260
encoding is a big part of this form

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,030
inputs are a big part of this you have a

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,970
moon Lao in your name you might not be

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,430
able to submit any form ever which is I

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,630
mean have you ever been through that

00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,980
where it's like this isn't a real name

00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,870
because it doesn't use the right letters

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,540
does that's happened to me a couple of

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,730
people um

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:10,160
dates times and currencies is anyone

00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,990
here American what date is this yeah I

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,100
thought so

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:18,620
ordering pluralization changes a lot

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,870
between languages and reasons grammar

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,330
and sends instructions the order of

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,430
verbs and nouns can swap over and that

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,610
if you try to sort of build your own

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:32,750
sentences that can really get you and

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:34,660
then relative time like days ago like

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,550
when you do a comment on github or

00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:41,420
sometimes I've seen on github like 23

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,710
seconds from now which baffles me I

00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:46,310
don't know if anyone's ever seen that

00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:48,200
and then as a bonus which I'm not going

00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,450
to talk too much about there's color

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,370
theory and responsive design just

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,310
because the sizes of things vary between

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,430
languages and character sets also for

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,680
example different colors in many

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:03,290
countries red is a lucky auspicious

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,670
color their react native apps must be

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:09,590
buggy as hell you know what I'm saying

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:12,380
so piece of cake right just a couple

00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,050
things to keep in mind um yes but it's

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,180
this cake with sparkles and glitter and

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,430
roses and a thousand tears so you know

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,020
what I made my own cake because I'm an

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,020
optimist and this is the

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,330
internationalisation cake with all the

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,120
different bits that you need to have a

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,320
good base to do it on the web some of

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,840
these are okay some of these are

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,280
optional cuz their libraries I get

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,170
people message me be like why don't you

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,970
use this other library which I wrote I'm

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,260
like I'm sure it's great this is just

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,570
the one I know so this is the one I'm

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,120
gonna teach you so first thing that's

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,580
important is Unicode Unicode is amazing

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,930
Unicode gave us utf-8 encoding which

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,830
means that every character in the world

00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:54,380
has a number Unicode gave us emoji and

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:57,560
really I think that's just priceless so

00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,590
we can write on the internet in any

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,290
script we want but Unicode is also in

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,630
charge of a few other things their

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:08,420
mission is to like develop and promote

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,970
the consortium develop and promote the

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,730
use of the Unicode standard but also

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,890
related globalization standards they're

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,360
in charge of the CLD are in ICU

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,830
technical committees which I'm going to

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,810
teach you what they are they're super

00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,000
cool and it's all under the unicode

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,740
umbrella they're in charge of

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,150
bi-directional text so if you want need

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,440
to write something in like Arabic or

00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:32,210
Hebrew they got you they also just redid

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,670
their home page which is a miracle

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,430
because their website was so ugly and it

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,220
just warms my heart

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,570
um let's talk about directional text

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:46,130
because you may we're talking about

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:48,650
Unicode in Unicode encodings each

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,480
character that you type is either

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,000
strongly or weakly typed with a

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,610
direction so maybe it's something in

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,420
Arabic is strongly typed as

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:01,670
right-to-left maybe like an English

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,530
letter or like a Western letter is typed

00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,450
left-to-right and then stuff like

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,880
exclamation points or weakly typed so

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:11,330
they could go either way they're you

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,870
know the BI characters so for example

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,820
this is the word for Egypt in English

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,490
and in Arabic and all these characters

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,040
are typed now Unicode has this Algar

00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,749
them that learns how to display the

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,129
characters based on the base direction

00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:29,959
of your document when you write HTML you

00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,720
can tell it what direction your document

00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,579
is going now some of you might be

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,980
thinking well if it's a right to left

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:39,290
language surely it knows the problem is

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,379
when you need to mix both so we need to

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,970
go in both directions so let's say you

00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:46,249
were writing an article in English but

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:49,970
you want to reference a book title in

00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:53,420
Arabic how does the Internet know which

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,249
direction to show your text so we can

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,920
tell it with a dar attribute der for

00:11:55,249 --> 00:12:00,410
Direction left to right we have three

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,569
words there you'll notice that the word

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,779
for Egypt is still in the same direction

00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:08,600
that it's coded up here but the words

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:12,559
are left to right if we change the base

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,350
direction of the file the words are

00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,240
written right-to-left the English words

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,240
are still written left-to-right and then

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:25,819
the Arabic word is sort of going with

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,160
the document so hot tip if you are in

00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:31,309
any point using bi-directional text make

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,799
sure you add the appropriate HTML tags

00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,269
to help out Unicode figure out how to

00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:39,589
show your text otherwise you can get

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:41,480
some really nasty bugs so hot tip while

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:42,740
researching this talk I found out there

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,240
is something called the internet

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,769
Engineering Task Force which is amazing

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,920
in my head it looks like this but let's

00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:56,660
be honest it doesn't and they publish

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,639
these things called the that the best

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,709
common practice is whoops too far

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,230
best common practices which are sort of

00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:06,350
like standards my favorite best common

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,990
practice from them or BCP is number 47

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:11,480
which shows us how to write tags for

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,339
identifying locales a locale is a

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,799
combination of a language in a region

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:19,850
and a couple of other sort of like sub

00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:23,809
classifications that tell us what that

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:27,319
user wants to see based on their

00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:29,449
language region so the specification

00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:32,830
says you need first a language tag which

00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:36,410
is usually two letters a dash and

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:39,920
like one or more subtags based on the

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:42,920
region so up top we have en which is

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,310
English as spoken in the US or English

00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,610
as spoken in Great Britain the second

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,580
one is MN Mongolian as written in the

00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:57,170
Cyrillic alphabet has spoken in Mongolia

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:59,840
the third is Z H is Chinese for jongwan

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,040
I think as written in the traditional

00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,240
character set as opposed to the

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,160
simplified character set they're

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,430
completely different as spoken in

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,210
Hongkong HK and the last one es is

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:14,660
Spanish Espanola 419 which is actually a

00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,280
number code for a region so 419 is Latin

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,610
America and the Caribbean which is where

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,540
I'm from

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,430
represent and so it's not always that

00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,270
same pattern of like a specific country

00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:28,070
it can be a region so if you remember my

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:32,020
super self-indulgent life story over

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:36,100
here these are all of my locales in

00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:40,430
theory so if I log on to your website as

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,950
me with this information what are you

00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,090
going to show me and really that's one

00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:46,940
of the hardest parts of

00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:50,950
internationalization so and if you take

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:54,080
anything away from this talk is this

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,060
always always let your user choose their

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,770
own locale you don't know if they're

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,820
traveling you know you don't know if

00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,050
there are immigrants you don't know if

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,450
they're learning a language you can't

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,120
just assume especially not based on

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:09,190
browsers especially not based on an IP

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:15,230
address so always always let your user

00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:17,810
nailed it great okay

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,040
this is one of my favorite parts of the

00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,620
things that I learned for this talk

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:28,240
the cldr is the common locale data

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,530
repository which is 24 megabytes of XML

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,920
that you can download for free on the

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:38,570
internet it's open source and it has all

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:44,240
of the information for every language /

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:46,550
locale about a ton of stuff so days of

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,190
the week names of months

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,290
timezones does the calendar start on a

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,560
Monday or does it start on a Sunday

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,600
what's the writing direction what how do

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,270
you capitalize things what are the names

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,000
of the cities of the world in that

00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:04,670
language all of that stuff you can just

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,080
zip file download from the unicode

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:11,390
website and it's thrilling now obviously

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,050
as web developers we don't work with xml

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,140
very much

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:19,310
neither do anyone else basically nobody

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:23,210
wants to so usually the cldr is wrapped

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:25,310
by like many layers of libraries but

00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:29,120
here's an example from when I downloaded

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:32,450
it last this is days of the week in

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,950
Spanish you'll notice like the XML tags

00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,260
are in English because that's the

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,870
language of the internet and so you have

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,270
the abbreviated versions the sort of

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:46,250
short two letter versions and then the

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:48,440
wide full word down there and you can do

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,540
this for any language just download it

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,490
it's great impress your friends if you

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,040
did want to play with this they have it

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:58,480
all as JSON on github that's just a

00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,560
fun-packed um I'd be careful a bit fine

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,390
the other thing that Unicode is in

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,000
charge of besides the cldr and the

00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,330
bi-directional text is the ICU now the

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,459
ICU started as a wrapper for the cldr

00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,410
repository and it's actually C++ and

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,950
Java libraries which I know doesn't help

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,640
us at all

00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:19,280
however they did define a message format

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,900
for writing strings in your string

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,459
resource files remember earlier when I

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,080
was like you could just have a JSON and

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,060
then point your strings to that JSON you

00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,100
can actually do a little more than just

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,360
have strings in those resource files and

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:34,420
I'm gonna show you two how you use it

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,520
right now so you can pass in a value

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:39,350
welcome and then a name and then it says

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,870
you know it's a template you know how

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,320
that works you can also give it a value

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,060
and a type so the green part is a

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,530
variable which you give it and then

00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,800
numbers like you actually have write the

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:54,410
word number and then that's how it knows

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,210
usually libraries or whatever how to

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,340
format what you've written so some

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,600
people use comments for a thousand

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,640
separator some people use periods

00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:10,870
you can also tell it options so you have

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,680
a value a type and then further options

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:20,680
offs to how you want that print it out

00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:23,290
you can also do selects so you know if

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,740
you like trains like I do and you can

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:29,050
also you use plurals so when they say

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,750
like o in box zero you don't have any

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:34,990
more messages or you have one message or

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,950
three messages you would write it

00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,700
something like this

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:44,350
is anyone here Russian cool okay so and

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,740
I don't speak Russian but in Russian

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,440
there's not just like singular and

00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,120
plural there's like one word for one

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,490
thing and there's another word for like

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,530
two to five things and then there's like

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,860
other words for like five to eleven

00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:02,830
things some like that so this in the

00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,480
Russian file has many more lines which

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,240
is why it's helpful to have it external

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,720
as a JSON resource when you actually

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,320
have a full app full of these types of

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,300
templates with the ICU message format

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,840
some things to think about one write

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:23,320
full sentences when possible do not try

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,160
to build sentences yourself like article

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,860
+ verb + now and do not do that it's a

00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,660
rabbit hole and then use this complex

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,050
arguments like the Select and the plural

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,960
as the outermost structure of a message

00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:40,450
now the biggest problem I have seen with

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,930
this is that this is usually written by

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:47,530
developers and developers hate repeating

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:51,280
themselves and internationalization

00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:54,670
string formats require in best practice

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,270
that you repeat yourself a ton so fight

00:19:54,670 --> 00:20:01,150
the urge to abstract common patterns out

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:04,710
I've seen it a million times it never

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:09,370
goes well and I'll show you an example

00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:10,660
let's say we have a sentence and it's a

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:13,910
user and they're logged in and maybe

00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,460
they told you like a gender field

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:19,220
and so you can have an option for male

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:22,270
female or other like non-binary and you

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:26,000
say that's fine I'll just switch on that

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:28,760
the problem is if you read this with the

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,250
Veii pronoun that is a singular pronoun

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,160
which means that for this to be correct

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,540
it would have to say they like to dance

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,970
not they likes so already we're screwed

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:44,200
so that's not gonna work so you say it's

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,440
fine I'll just put the verb in sign

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,240
easy-peasy

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,800
right cuz then I don't have to repeat

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,900
the line every time because I'm a

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,680
developer and I wouldn't you know I

00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:58,760
learned this and this is fine

00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:03,290
in English but the second you move to

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,840
any languages that gender verbs or that

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,620
flip around verbs and nouns of which

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,840
there are many this breaks down like

00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:17,000
that so it's not really gonna work in

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:20,810
the correct way to do it is this full

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,370
sentences repeated I know but you have

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:28,640
to do it trust me because your

00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:32,510
translators and your files will have the

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,410
maximum flexibility for this JavaScript

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,450
alert this is the part where it gets fun

00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:40,460
turns out JavaScript has an

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,990
internationalization API already baked

00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:47,840
in which is great for us it's also in

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:51,470
development so if you want to contribute

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,660
you can find that it's echo 402 and this

00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:58,180
is how it works

00:21:52,660 --> 00:22:01,190
you create a new instance of in tool and

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,350
then there's a date time for matter a

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,640
number formatter and then I think a call

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:08,540
later which is what does the ordering

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:14,200
and alphabetizing you initialize it with

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:17,960
a locale a bcp 47 locale j a is japanese

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,430
you then pass it options so do you want

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,280
a currency fun fact in Japan they don't

00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:27,380
use sense so the API knows that and then

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,740
if it's a currency what currency code

00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,230
and that's

00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:32,450
whole different standard and then once

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,070
it's created you can say dot format and

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,200
then pass it in the number you want to

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:40,340
format same with dates you can give it

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,170
all these options problem is especially

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,080
in react where you rerender stuff a ton

00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:48,500
the overhead for it like maintaining

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,179
this is super high so if you had to

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,750
create a formatter for each different

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,850
locale each different set of options you

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,020
if like if you wanted a shorter date

00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,390
somewhere else on your site you would

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,720
need to create a whole new one

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,030
so it's not ideal it's also like

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,940
supported fine but not all the way so

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,110
there's like a polyfill situation and

00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,460
it's expensive it is a work in progress

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:14,840
these are the things you can Google if

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,950
you're interested to see what they're

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,929
coming up with there's some really cool

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:21,530
stuff in the pipeline a couple years

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:25,429
maybe and this is sort of like never not

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,870
gonna be a thing which is great and also

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,420
the disclaimer that I'm using the

00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:31,280
library I'm using because I used it

00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,460
before not because I think your library

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,800
has been so there's a library called

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,200
format yes it's built by Yahoo it's

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,500
open-source it has bindings for react

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,870
ember handlebars and dust and it has a

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,809
lot of react components that you can use

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,179
to do formatting of strings so

00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:53,770
translations dates numbers currencies

00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:58,309
and then some other assorted like

00:23:53,770 --> 00:24:00,950
packages for like relative time and

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,570
stuff like that in react it just looks

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,720
like this you import a component

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,059
formatted message you give it an ID

00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,960
which is the idea of your string in your

00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:13,640
JSON file you can give it a default

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,309
message if you want because sometimes

00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,190
the JSON files aren't on the same

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:20,720
version and then you can also pass it in

00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,040
values that will get filled in in those

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:28,580
little templates we learned about with

00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:31,790
the ICU message format from Unicode it's

00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,220
I've found it helpful in my projects to

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,190
make the IDs sort of like be very

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,940
descriptive if you want you can also

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,940
make them like co-located and then like

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:47,480
pack them later but I'm not about that

00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,240
life this is an example of what a string

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,750
resource file might look like with the

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,100
ICU message format conditionals we got

00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,730
some templates at the top we got a

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:03,400
complex select plus what is it

00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:07,160
pluralization down here and this is

00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,290
Spanish text and English IDs if you

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:13,040
don't want to use react you can use

00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:15,470
format jsj plain JavaScript in toldot

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,230
form as message just npm install it it's

00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:26,480
great those are the bits of the cake yay

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:29,990
however internationalization has a

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,840
logistics problem and that's really what

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,980
bites big teams sometimes even small

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,470
teams so let's say you build it up and

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:40,820
then you internationalized and then

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:42,260
maybe a year later you're like you know

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,540
what we're ready to launch in other

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,820
languages so I'm gonna go and get my

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:49,280
strings translated by like I don't know

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,790
a freelancer a company and then I'm

00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:56,450
gonna deploy my site now I want to add a

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:59,180
feature so I need to get the strings for

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:01,520
the new feature translated and then

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,770
maybe some of my languages are ready but

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,740
maybe the Portuguese translation is on

00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,230
vacation so do I wait for them to come

00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,570
back and finish do I deploy my site

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,730
knowing that it's not gonna be complete

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,320
for one of languages and then while I'm

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,150
deciding that what if somebody else

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,200
that's a different feature and then

00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,870
they're ready to deploy because all

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,630
their languages are there do I wait for

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,640
them do they wait for me do I release an

00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,720
incomplete situation what if I want to

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,920
change one of the strings that's already

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,450
in the old features you know so there's

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,240
this concept now of continuous

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,100
localization which is how you basically

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,810
integrate localization into your dev

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,570
workflow so that it's automatic and

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,010
seamless and does not cause any of this

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:48,260
should I wait for them should they wait

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:50,870
for me conflicts most this is a mostly

00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,930
like a lot of like software-as-a-service

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:54,870
companies do this I used to use one

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,180
called Smart Ling

00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,800
that would like read your commits do the

00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,490
translations and then commit back into

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,910
your PRS which was pretty cool not free

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:07,890
disclaimer so because of all of this

00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:11,100
internationalization is much easier to

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,590
integrate into your project early it's

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,750
much harder to retrofit and like I

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,610
mentioned before if you international

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,800
eyes that doesn't mean you have to

00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:23,040
translate stuff right away it just means

00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,920
that your code is flexible a lot of

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,300
companies go like don't really think of

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,550
this and they say you know what that's a

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,410
problem for later and then it takes

00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,760
twice or thrice as long and I'm gonna

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,580
give you an example of this I used to

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,490
work at a company based in the UK called

00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:41,840
train line train line sells train and

00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:47,370
bus tickets across Europe it works here

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:51,540
and we decided we wanted to have

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:56,070
something like 12 currencies and like 16

00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,860
languages and so when you select when

00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,200
you went onto like you search like

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,640
London to Paris or whatever we would

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,410
automatically pick the cheapest ticket

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,150
and give you a little pop-up that said

00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,600
we've selected a ticket based on the

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:15,110
cheapest price you're welcome

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:20,390
when we added German we had a problem

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:24,390
because German has super long words and

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:27,090
we went crap we did not think of this so

00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,950
we investigated we put a team on it

00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:31,710
turns out it was just like a fixed

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:34,620
height somewhere in the CSS so we got

00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,840
rid of that boom problem solved German

00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:41,900
fits great

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:45,390
now that was the easy one train line

00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:48,120
started as a UK only thing and the UK

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,190
train system is very complicated so the

00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,890
easiest way to display tickets was as a

00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:56,100
grid all the columns were times of

00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:58,740
departure and all the rows were types of

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,840
ticket of which there are many and then

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,730
we could show you which ones were

00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,059
cheaper which ones had limited

00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:09,549
availability you'll notice however

00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:14,320
that that limited availability is just

00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:17,860
like a little tight it's mine still but

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,529
like it's still a little like ooh then

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:23,590
the boss came down and was like we need

00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:26,350
to show this in French and also in

00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:35,080
Swedish Krona now notice that this is

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:39,039
pounds we've lost the currency symbol

00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:46,389
you'll notice the limited availability

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:48,129
is like cannot breathe it's like the

00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:50,860
only solution we can find it to this

00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:56,470
internationalization problem was putting

00:29:50,860 --> 00:30:00,580
a team of six people for two months to

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:03,309
turn this into that because now we have

00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,769
room for all the messaging all the

00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:07,570
currency symbols inflation if you've

00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:10,659
ever tried to sell something in like

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,190
what a Venezuela yeah thank you it would

00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:16,090
be like three million five hundred

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,309
whatever and like does that fit so

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:21,429
integrate internationalization as early

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:23,860
as you can to avoid surprises to avoid

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:28,360
time sinks it's a be long-term greedy

00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:32,259
like Jared said yeah so that's important

00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,480
tip now the rest of these are like fun

00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:36,999
tips but please research them before you

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,909
use them you can style for specific

00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:43,149
languages in CSS but there's browser

00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:46,480
issues so be careful there's a pseudo

00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:48,009
selector : lang and then you put in a

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,049
language code which is the two letters

00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:52,299
this is really helpful sometimes for

00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:54,999
like when you're doing quotes that's

00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:57,940
like the most common example so for

00:30:54,999 --> 00:31:01,629
example if you want to quote somebody in

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:03,580
English you do the sky commas and then

00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:05,710
in French or German you can use the

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,110
little carrots which is great in your

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,869
CSS you just pass in a language code and

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:15,009
then you can decide what you want to

00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:19,270
show I've never had to use this but if

00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:21,860
you do just know it's there

00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,000
this is super fun this is a fun fact

00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,910
line-breaks

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,310
not all languages have line breaks or

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:33,640
spaces between words so context which is

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:37,130
some like like Thai does this too

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,990
there's no spaces in the words these

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:43,430
lines are everywhere where you could

00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:46,310
reasonably break the text but how does a

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:48,560
computer and know that it's a actually a

00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,780
hard problem it hasn't been solved in

00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,430
like a good way yet there's a lot of

00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,220
sort of like look ahead dictionary

00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,020
lookup types of things so if you're like

00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,180
writing or if you're a native speaker

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,120
you know where it feels right to do

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:05,840
those breaks but for a computer real

00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,060
hard I put a link at the bottom and I'll

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,290
share the slides of more information

00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:12,440
about this line break problem because

00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:14,020
it's fascinating so what have we learned

00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,030
so far

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,280
one internationalization is part of

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,660
accessibility internationalize all the

00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,240
things it doesn't have to be a huge

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:27,260
effort if you start early and you're

00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,760
really opening the doors to more people

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,480
around the world and isn't that really

00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,270
what the internet is about it's

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,720
supported by a bunch of standards mostly

00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:40,550
from the Unicode consortium but even

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:46,040
just knowing what to Google helps do it

00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:48,020
right because maybe what you feel like

00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,550
doing intuitively like so do not repeat

00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,930
yourself thing might not be the right

00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,300
thing so it's good to familiarize

00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:55,220
yourself with the standards also these

00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,380
standards by the way are not just for

00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,380
the web they apply also to sort of like

00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:03,290
mobile development and documentation

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,580
that kind of thing try to start early if

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:11,630
you can it's much harder to retrofit

00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:14,690
always always always let your user you

00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:17,510
got it you guys are superstars also and

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:20,360
I understand this is a fun crowd for

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:23,510
this if you're not already starting from

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,850
it German is a great first test language

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,250
cuz it will a hundred percent break your

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,500
website if you start at a hundred

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,280
percent have you started from any other

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,380
language

00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,600
I've been le tweet at me I'll be around

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:44,480
at the breaks thank you

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,480
