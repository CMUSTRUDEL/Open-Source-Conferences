I just feel like it's a very community

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,910
driven conference it also is a lot of

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,769
quality and people are just nice hi my

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,730
name's Sarah and this is agent comp in

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,420
Dortmund

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,099
[Music]

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,500
amazing venue Austria is beautiful

00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:25,300
meeting all the people in the community

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:31,199
and getting to go and hang out and ski

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:36,900
[Music]

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:40,629
Hey hi everyone

00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:42,339
cool really excited to be here

00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:45,040
and yeah today we'll talk about

00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:49,479
controlling our apps with your mind and

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,729
I mean it literally but myself

00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:54,309
my name is viola Novick this is like my

00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:56,110
new like pre branding thing like

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,909
neurologic labs I'm independent

00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,559
consultant

00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:02,830
I'm also Google developer expert author

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:08,590
engineer and I do bunch of things in web

00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:10,600
mobile VR AR I ta I probably if I add

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,350
blockchain will be top of buzzwords but

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,840
still not doing blockchain so I will try

00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,940
to squeeze all of these into one talk

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,860
today so we'll talk about controlling

00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,270
apps with your mind I will try to go

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,790
through all of the spectrum of

00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,780
technologies that use so we'll see how

00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,820
it goes about like what I do basically I

00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,310
do like software architecture consulting

00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,100
I do it hands-on engineering on sites

00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,490
remote workshops trainings stuff like

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,350
that mentoring devrel evaluation

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,880
services if you interested some of these

00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,420
just like ping me on the break we'll

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,540
talk about this more so before diving

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,630
into the tech part I want to talk a

00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,490
little bit about the future

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,560
we started with South in the year and

00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,030
this conference is the perfect

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,530
opportunity to talk about that because

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:05,830
we just started in new decade and lots

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,690
of people evaluated like the last decade

00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,420
and how technology evolved through the

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,879
decade and now we start you looking in

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,310
the future and to see how things will be

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,489
changing and how we can take part in

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,189
this change so I would say we are in

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,889
sort of the transition phase where we

00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:26,040
need to decide how our future will will

00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:26,040
look

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,550
so we are the one the ones who actually

00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,500
like break the rules to make new ones

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:39,490
and I will explain a little bit more

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,420
what do I mean by that but let's see at

00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:45,010
the medium that we will probably use in

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,530
the future we're talking about where

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,200
we're talking about mobile but is it the

00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,520
correct medium we will use we'll see a

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,350
lot of like VR apps coming out they are

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,350
lots of things lots of new things and

00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,500
we'll the web still be there on mobile

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:06,040
she'll be there will it change which

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,930
dimensions we will use maybe something

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,700
new coming out we don't know off right

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,100
which in which dimensions we will

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:17,860
manipulate of the data either we are we

00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,230
are looking at lots of the Arabs which

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,780
are mostly entertainment purpose but

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,430
think about this really amazing movie by

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,870
the way already player one when

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,549
everything was inside we are right and

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,640
it might be the future it might be not

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:36,549
we don't know we see that VR is changing

00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,880
towards entertainment world into

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:45,010
entertainment and AR is more or getting

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,260
into our day-to-day life we see lots of

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,530
AR apps on the App Store and the Play

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,440
Store we see lots of companies investing

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,329
into AR as a new technology we can

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,049
probably think of ourselves going

00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:03,239
through the streets looking on augmented

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:07,480
data on top of different of seen ads

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:11,860
hopefully not but it might be also other

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,220
dimensions which we don't know so how we

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:19,930
should prepare for that transition how

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,060
we should adapt should we adapt or

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,880
should we shatter foundations that we

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:28,570
have foundations of UI foundations of UX

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,660
and invent something you some new

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,560
techniques no one had heard about or

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,950
maybe something that is you just like

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,220
playing around thinking and maybe will

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,320
be

00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,990
something new that will change the

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,920
future new UX patterns

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:51,580
best practices we are the ones to invent

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,640
those and I think in this transition

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,260
phase is the perfect opportunity to

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,650
think about all of these things and and

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,410
to start doing that let's talk about

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:08,560
what are the very foundations of UI and

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:10,960
UX and I think it's to the medium again

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,080
this talk is my opinion you can agree

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,500
with that you can disagree with it but

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:21,910
eventually I think we gone a long way

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,680
from cave drawings to mobile apps it's

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,020
really a long way but everything is

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,330
based on the same foundation to the

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,910
medium history fault

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,820
color theory I'm not saying color is not

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:37,360
something we should use we shouldn't use

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:41,200
we definitely will use color theory but

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,740
it will be in some different way and we

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,140
essentially fake third dimension when we

00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,610
see you can say okay we see like 3d

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:54,190
stuff on our 2d flat screens like 3d

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:58,180
models three objects stuff even in VR

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,650
we've seen like 3d stuff but in fact

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,020
what is 3d

00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,020
it's a shader which is a function of

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:08,310
light and how light is reflected so

00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:12,250
basically we fake the third dimension

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,590
now XR is adding a new dimension because

00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,440
it can comprehend the dimension you like

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:21,060
your physical world and put things

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:25,510
inside this physical world like overlain

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:30,700
so how we've adopted we I mean VR is not

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:34,560
a new thing right how we've adopted this

00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,720
was yeah so let's say we have a TR app

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,390
then we walk in inside on where they are

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,490
up and let's say we like working with

00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:45,510
our controllers or using choices or

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:50,380
whatever and then we need to enter data

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:52,840
how would you enter data we have flat

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,330
form with three

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,840
the keyboard that we type in VR and

00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:02,650
enter the data there is it the right way

00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:06,070
things to do or maybe it's not maybe

00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:09,040
having like logging in will be more

00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,180
natural if you just go to some kind of

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,520
VR counter

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:17,530
take out your wallet or passport put it

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:20,470
there and just go inside so these are

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,210
reality based interactions and this is

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,360
something we should think of let's say

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,810
in lots of the are apps AR apps you see

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,680
these arrows look there look to the

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:35,440
right look to the left and it doesn't it

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,330
does make sense on the web it does make

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,130
sense on mobile but it doesn't make

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,080
sense a reality you wouldn't walk down

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,850
the street and you will see arrow turned

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:49,900
right right so how do you do these

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:53,199
reality based interactions you might be

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,020
slow in time and I mean like if you

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,960
throw an object in VR and if you look at

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,560
the object an object will fly slowly

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,889
over your shoulder psychologically you

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,370
will just follow this object try or we

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,380
will use sound we will use haptics we'll

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:15,250
use different things we're not used to

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,430
use on mobile on and on web that was

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,930
really cool talk yesterday about

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,389
adaptive UI this is one of the

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,940
additional things we can think of also

00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:28,840
in VR in Excel right so I won't go into

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:30,010
it the talk was really amazing but today

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,010
I want to talk about some different

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:38,550
techniques and I'm talking about actual

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:41,620
mind-reading and before going into

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:49,320
actual mind-reading I will ask you a

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:55,120
question what what is it known universe

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,950
that's right and what is it these are

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,140
neurons in our brain that's right so

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,400
they cut a similar right so we have the

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:06,160
universe inside of us

00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,710
and this is cool how does it work

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,820
let's talk a little bit about how

00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:15,670
neurons work so neuron looks like this

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,570
haven't seen in but probably something

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:21,730
that and neural neurons excitatory

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,300
neuron releases glutamate and now it

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:27,640
will be lots of terms but I will try to

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,650
go first through that this so the neuron

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,350
release glutamate and basically what it

00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,690
does it loses like sodium ions to the

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,100
surrounding which makes it the of

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:42,250
excitatory neuron makes it less negative

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,670
which will mean positive and will have a

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,650
dipole which is basically which

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,440
basically means we'll have a battery in

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:54,490
our every couple of neurons will have a

00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,680
battery and in our skull in our brain

00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,360
will have something like this lots of a

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,810
positive neurons lots of negative ions

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,670
so we'll have potential changes that

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:07,930
will go through the skull we can measure

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,540
with electrodes so this is cool we can

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,660
measure things we can do something with

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,480
data so if we measure we get

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:22,450
oscillations that looks something like

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:24,070
this this is the awake brain and this is

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:28,450
the sleep brain and you can see the

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:33,850
difference the solutions of my micron

00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:38,110
volt changes of our brain activity so

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:40,480
how do we measure that we have this type

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:44,200
of system which is called eg and

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,710
basically it's headsets that you might

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:52,120
seen either in movies or might even seen

00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:55,630
in research labs might even used so this

00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,890
headset has electrodes on all over your

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:03,880
head and they measure the voltage and

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:08,200
based on that we can do some predictions

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,300
maybe changes and detect changes in

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,270
behavior detect the person's sleep or

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,770
not and there are a bunch of research

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:19,540
edges which look like this and it's not

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,870
something you will wear to

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,170
your local coffee shop and it's all

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,180
surprised pretty high so probably you

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,730
won't have that at home unless you do

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:35,050
like neuroscience researches stuff like

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:38,110
that but there are consumer ages which

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:44,009
priced pretty recently and actually I

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,009
have one here so that's fine

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:48,449
heroin here and will actually measure my

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,589
brain today

00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:55,870
so these eg headset it's basically a

00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,029
consumer product and just disclaimer I'm

00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,279
not getting money from them to talk

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:05,079
about them

00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:09,040
at the conference it's just it's a nice

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:13,269
product that I use so what it does it

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,819
has several electrodes and it's just

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:18,279
four electrodes you can add auxiliary

00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:20,410
electrode but four is enough for our

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,829
demo today and what it measures it

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,010
measures like the the production product

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:30,579
is basically measuring helping me with

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,470
meditation so if I meditate and I hear

00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,980
like the sounds of nature

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:38,860
and if my mind starts to wonder then

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,410
it's more like stormy weather if it's

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,540
calm I hear like build singing stuff

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:48,339
like that it's kind of nice they have

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:51,819
enough stuff like that so how do we

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,800
connect that thing to our brain so I

00:12:51,819 --> 00:13:00,389
open my skull here no just kidding

00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:03,939
I can connect it through a Bluetooth and

00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:06,310
it has a library this device the library

00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:09,540
was ported from Python by a friend of

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:14,230
mine and libraries called me usages so

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:18,550
to connect it to my brain I will use web

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:20,889
Bluetooth API and connect you through

00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,779
what filtering through services now with

00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:23,769
Bluetooth you have different services

00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:26,829
and different color story

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:29,949
characteristics you can see about you

00:13:26,829 --> 00:13:33,279
can think about characteristics as kind

00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:35,970
of methods that you execute sort of if

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,730
read more about the little thing and

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:42,279
it's not that supported so you can do

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,620
things in chrome but we're talking about

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,189
the future we're talking experimenting

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:52,139
with stuff right so let's let's see what

00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:54,790
we can do with that and let's actually

00:13:52,139 --> 00:14:00,370
see what we can do with that I will use

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:03,389
this website which is basically if you

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:09,269
want to read more about eg it's a nice

00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:12,910
to RL website with lots of things there

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:24,100
so I will try to connect to my Bluetooth

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:31,439
headset and we'll pair to that and we'll

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:37,420
see voltage signals here in a bit so

00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:42,000
this is my brain yeah and let's say I

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,000
want to do something with this data

00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:51,910
let's say I will blink nothing let's

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,300
look at the raw data this one is kinda

00:14:51,910 --> 00:15:03,600
slow let's look at the raw unfiltered

00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:13,889
data okay a little bit better I just

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:13,889
connected more so I blink I blink

00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:22,480
so you've seen the spikes here right so

00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,029
we can measure the spike we can

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,309
understand there is something going on

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:35,579
and measure these blinks so let's

00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:41,109
actually do that so I have this demo app

00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:47,470
which I can connect to my headset then

00:15:41,109 --> 00:16:01,059
let's open the console let's see it the

00:15:47,470 --> 00:16:05,109
connection here so just second let's say

00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:12,040
okay here and let me zoom a little bit

00:16:05,109 --> 00:16:14,139
so you will see things okay so I connect

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,249
to my headset

00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:20,859
I said client has initialized and

00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:23,379
basically it now what I want to do here

00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:26,230
I guess I'm a big say tree by the way

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:29,410
for like all the state management stuff

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:36,819
so what I want to do here I want to use

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:40,739
effect and here I will look for the muse

00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:43,779
client now muse client will expose

00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:50,639
Eric's observables that I can subscribe

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:56,980
to so I can say muse client eg readings

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:59,579
subscribe will get value and let's look

00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,579
what we get

00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:17,939
okay let's reload that okay this is use

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:22,010
client AEG yeah readings okay yeah sure

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,010
I need to check if I have MS client

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:34,830
let's do that connect to muse okay we

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,020
have some problems let's solve them life

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:49,580
coding is not always smooth so eg

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:56,039
readings that's fine okay yes thanks

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:58,679
cool you're awake okay I have my brain

00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:01,440
readings and we can see there are bunch

00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,669
of electrodes ins kind of randomized way

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:08,460
just piping through all the data inside

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:11,370
so how do I do stuff for that try it so

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,830
I have samples here on every like

00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,889
microseconds whatever I'm getting an

00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:20,389
array of twelve samples which is

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:23,340
basically voltage and potential changes

00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:26,070
so now I need to kind of go through that

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,600
and filter my electrodes and stuff like

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,520
that and I want to talk about lots of

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,909
things today so I will just show you how

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:37,860
it's done let's go inside the store here

00:18:32,909 --> 00:18:41,250
and let's add first of all let's just

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,139
add the battery data and let's subscribe

00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,649
to blinky now I'll show you how it looks

00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:49,139
how it works first and then how the code

00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:56,460
looks blink okay let me remove the

00:18:49,139 --> 00:19:04,250
console.log thing let's remove that get

00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:09,309
back connect link link link link link

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:13,090
link so this I can do

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:17,980
a bunch of stuff but this is just

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:21,970
starting right so let's look what we do

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:24,190
here we get the left channel basically

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,190
its index one so it's just a helper and

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,190
I get the stream now I will use our rigs

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,139
pipe to filter through all my data

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,789
now with our rigs we're talking about

00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,649
the several streams right so we have the

00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,169
data that is streamed we can do

00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:40,120
different manipulations on the data now

00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:42,629
I want to filter my data based on

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,480
electrode so I want to get only this one

00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:49,119
near my left eye now I don't care about

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,600
the data I care about the maximum of the

00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:58,960
spike right I want you know if if it's

00:19:52,600 --> 00:20:01,929
enough and I do the maximum here and I

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,389
don't care about negative values so

00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:08,379
basically I map through that and I

00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:12,970
filter the spike over 300 can be eighty

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:15,159
can do 100 it depends on the power like

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,970
if I want to blink a little bit and and

00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:22,119
have it filed then it will be at 80 it's

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,159
more like trial a trial and error then I

00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,509
use the switch map operator which

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,759
basically in rxjs

00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:31,740
it means that it stops the observable

00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:35,999
creates the new absorb new observer and

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:39,059
basically returns one waits for 500

00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:42,700
milliseconds and then returns zero and

00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:44,200
does it one time why because I want just

00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,220
one blink I don't want you have like

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,629
blink blink blink blink blink

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:52,990
whenever I get to this spike so cool I

00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:55,769
have blinking now what else I can get

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:59,919
from here I can get accelerated

00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:03,419
accelerometer data let's look at the

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,299
code here you've seen the samples array

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:12,639
I'm getting the why I'm checking if it's

00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:16,960
above 1.0.1 a chicken eggs as well just

00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:21,110
lots of trial and error and let's see

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:28,429
how it looks like okay

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:31,790
right left right left blink right left

00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:33,799
so a little bit unstable right so it

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:37,010
wasn't control your webpage was just

00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:40,520
things flying around right right left

00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:45,220
right left like what's going on so let's

00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:49,840
make things more stable more concise

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:54,350
let's look let's comment out this I

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,210
don't need this accelerometer and let me

00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:06,549
explain a little bit more and get back

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:06,549
to the slides so how do i okay let's

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:18,919
come on fullscreen okay so how we

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:20,540
measure things more precisely and we

00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,570
have the just the voltage spikes it's

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:27,919
not something like stable and so on we

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:31,460
need to do kind of filtering on our EEG

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,490
data so first thing that we will do will

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,440
do a band pass filter dental pass filter

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,299
will reduce cutoff flow and cut of high

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,910
frequencies to basically get just the

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:48,290
middle of the graph to be more precise

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:52,669
the data remove noise if you now then we

00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:55,669
will use epics is it's a term in eg but

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:58,250
basically it means that it will have all

00:22:55,669 --> 00:23:00,500
the stream of data and divided into

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,419
chunks of with specific time frame

00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,730
because I actually need just the

00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:07,790
specific time frames to understand

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:12,970
what's happening there so I divide

00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:18,200
things into a box and then I will use

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:20,270
fast Fourier transform which is theorem

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,880
of taking these type of frequency and

00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:25,190
convert into this type of this type of

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,700
data convert into frequency now why it's

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:31,640
important here I have kinda raw data I

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,070
can detect the spikes with frequency I

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:40,130
can detect the actual frequencies

00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:43,700
now then I can recognize different brain

00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:47,090
waves which is nice but what does it

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,040
mean so we have five brain waves we have

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,250
the gamma the better alpha theta and

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:58,430
Delta and the brain waves depend on the

00:23:52,250 --> 00:24:02,210
frequency like the between like 0.5 to

00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:04,160
for its Delta and and so on so that

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,830
gamma is more like heightened perception

00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,930
and learning and problem-solving and

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:12,140
stuff like that better is kinda you are

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:14,090
all now and better it's like if you not

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,610
sleeping maybe someone in alpha and

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:21,410
sleeping so I don't know that's everyone

00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:25,340
so alpha is more sleeping State or a

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:29,060
physical mentally relaxed then there is

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:32,990
a theta which is kind of creativity and

00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,580
deep state and dreams whenever you go

00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:38,360
into deep meditation you can be in theta

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:40,940
state and Delta is more like no dreams

00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:46,250
nothing happening just leave me alone

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:48,920
I'm and Delta state so we can react to

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,570
brainwave spikes and then we can

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,330
understand if a person focused on

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:56,720
something or if a person is relaxed or

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,250
if person is his mind is wandering

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,730
basically that's how this product works

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:04,550
it looks at the alpha waves and

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:08,150
understands if I'm calm with and has

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:13,670
specific algorithms obviously but that's

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:14,200
that's how it works and we can react to

00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,050
that

00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,140
but I told you about AI right so let's

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,850
feed our brain to AI and hopefully AI

00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:29,020
want through the world because they'll

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:33,260
have a brain data so let's look at that

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:35,150
so what I will do first I will subscribe

00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,940
to focus date and I will see how I'm

00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:39,740
focused or relaxed and I don't know how

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,600
it will work because I tested it without

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,730
being on stage I don't know if I'm

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,700
stressed or not you'll decide actually

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,700
what will see the data so let's look

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:08,430
so I'm blinking too much and as I will

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:16,250
just try to close my eyes and relax a

00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:22,910
little bit yeah doesn't work let's

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:26,670
improve threshold let's look at the

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:28,620
actual code here so I have subscribed to

00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:32,070
focus and I have a bunch of stuff going

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:36,000
on so first of all I have zip samples a

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,890
helper from use library which basically

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,740
gives me just the samples not the

00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,170
electrodes it kinda zips them and then I

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,650
can run it through our expire now we

00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:48,179
talked about band pass filter we do in

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,330
the bandpass filter to reduce the noise

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:56,000
then separate into epics with duration

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:59,120
for 800 interval and then we apply FFT

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:04,020
algorithm to kind of get the frequencies

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:09,179
now here I will get the Delta power and

00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,220
I filter if my Delta is more than 150

00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,220
then you will see here value and it was

00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,850
more than 115 so I was kind of in a deep

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:21,030
sleep probably I don't know

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:23,070
then I have the ice close thing which

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,950
I'm looking at doing the same thing but

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,940
I'm looking at the Alpha a wave and here

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:37,190
let's just increase it a little bit and

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:37,190
we'll see what will be my alpha wave

00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,590
so as lower its if I relax more it goes

00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,110
lower if I as you can see like if I talk

00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:52,240
and like wave my hands and stuff like

00:27:50,110 --> 00:28:00,160
that it just spikes and then it

00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:02,290
disappears but if I just relax I can get

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,200
it down right so we can analyze the

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:08,170
focus we can understand the focus which

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:17,170
is cool but it's not enough I want a eye

00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:23,770
in the picture so let me to focus remove

00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:25,990
this one and this time I will load the

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:31,930
whole like uncommon the whole section I

00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:33,940
have here the prediction panel we'll see

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:37,360
how it works and then we'll look at the

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,420
code so I will try to think about

00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,920
different things out web mobile VR XR I

00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:46,390
Vai and I will try to the machine

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,470
learning to understand what I'm thinking

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:56,080
about so first of all what I need to do

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:59,800
is to connect my headset to the to the

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,400
thing okay working blink is a good thing

00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:07,510
like I need that I can test myself so

00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,690
now I try to focus on one card at a time

00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:14,280
whenever I focus on the card I will try

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:19,390
to click this title which will basically

00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:21,790
add an example to cane and classifier of

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:25,120
like machine learning will add an

00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:29,650
example and as more example are added

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:32,220
the more precise will be prediction so

00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,220
let's try that

00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:51,780
okay now let's let's try the same okay

00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:51,780
let's think about different stuff

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:05,030
and as you can see I can change this

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,470
cult and differentiate between

00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:10,560
manipulates the web basically by methods

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:12,780
trial one thing I need to do though is

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,350
to feed it with data now obviously I

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:19,340
need a lot of data so if let's say it

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,980
will add more examples of the R then the

00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:25,230
the frequency via it will probably

00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,450
switch to the are more because of the

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,480
how it works

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:34,290
but let's look at the code and how it's

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,910
actually done so first of all what I

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:42,630
will do I'm using ml 5 ml 5 library but

00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:45,330
basically it's based on tensor flow so I

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,950
just don't need to create tensors I use

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,750
the library and I use cane and a

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,870
classifier you can read more about cane

00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,630
and your neighbor algorithm in AI but

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,200
basically how it works in a nutshell you

00:30:54,630 --> 00:31:01,380
feed it examples and then you click the

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,210
hit the classify matter and the classify

00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,630
will try to predict based on the amount

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:10,140
of examples that it has so now in my

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:13,070
prediction panel I will get the newest

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:17,040
client and you will see this in a bit

00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:20,100
because if I flag and I will again pass

00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,120
that through bandpass filters I will

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:28,350
split my data to epics then I will do

00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,410
through go through FFT algorithm slice

00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:34,980
it based on hi-low meaning like reducing

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:38,160
the noise having just the exact data and

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:41,360
I will set my PhD in the state now

00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,310
whenever you run slicer 50 you will get

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,840
BSD object which will have all the

00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:47,370
electrodes and all the data so I'm not

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,640
feeding only one electrode with or the

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:55,220
whole data have across my head now if

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:58,620
you wonder for these methods I use the

00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,890
where is the neuro City pipes which is

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,390
cool library that has lots of

00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:07,830
neuroscience helpers that you can use

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:14,670
and just run them as as I did here and

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:19,020
and so on so I have here a bunch of

00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:21,540
buttons so inside the card I have a

00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,580
Train prop whenever I click on the

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:28,590
button it just add the sample with the

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:31,920
label VR or I T or a I web and mobile

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:35,390
stuff like that and then whenever I'm

00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:40,800
ready I can click on the classify and

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:46,590
classify well let's look at the classify

00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:51,150
method it was set classify flag and in

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:54,600
my effect I will run the classify all

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:58,560
the time to classify the result whenever

00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,870
result is returned I put inside the

00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,060
prediction and based on the prediction I

00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:05,310
can activate the card if it's if it's

00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,820
web and mobile then here is octave or

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:11,700
VRA

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:15,450
Excel or itai stuff like that now this

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:19,410
is cool we've seen bunch of 580 we seen

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:28,170
bunch of stuff but let's do another cool

00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:36,510
step and go here uncomment this part and

00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:40,380
come on uncomment this part let's go to

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:44,600
this card no no to the skull sorry the

00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:51,800
prediction panel and let's uncomment

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:51,800
this one so we have a drone

00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:11,980
don't you at home dangerous okay it's

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:16,800
kinda intimidating with its eyes so no

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,800
worries fingers crossed

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:30,100
okay let's connect to our drone and the

00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:33,359
drones here and it's not flying yeah I

00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,359
see I can see it so fine

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:42,250
okay now let's record brainwaves for

00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:50,530
drone turning left and for drone turning

00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:54,159
right and okay yeah probably

00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:57,250
okay cool why didn't work I don't have

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,109
used connected right okay don't have EG

00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:04,150
readings nothing so how can i train

00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:06,330
without any data so let's connect users

00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,330
well

00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:21,780
okay it looks like it's not really

00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:24,900
working let's disconnect that connect

00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:37,470
again we'll see if it will work this

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:42,720
time okay let's see not sure it will

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:49,079
work maybe it will okay

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:51,829
oh come on battery level level Oh

00:35:49,079 --> 00:36:00,930
seriously

00:35:51,829 --> 00:36:02,069
No wake up I need to not blink because

00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:11,760
then it will then

00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:19,230
okay okay I'm blinking we haven't found

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:21,329
it yet let's go to our store and change

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:27,170
our blinking threshold to be something

00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:35,299
more okay let's see

00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:35,299
connect the drone connect our muse

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:55,120
oh come on wake up

00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,489
so what

00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,489
[Applause]

00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:30,070
actually someone wants you to try that

00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:41,720
here you go

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:49,390
now I will try to inject my thoughts

00:37:41,720 --> 00:38:00,460
ceiebrate no just kidding it's up to you

00:37:49,390 --> 00:38:04,490
okay let's connect the headset now blink

00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:10,520
okay it works and it blinks now try to

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:18,190
think about web and mobile the out about

00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:18,190
VR and they are about our eta I

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:42,950
good now want to control the drone now

00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:52,870
if you now if you blink the drone will

00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:57,940
take off wait the drone will follow you

00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,940
now think about drone not following you

00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,050
now drawn for turning the right to the

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:19,910
right

00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:21,970
okay blink you killed the drones okay

00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:26,990
let's

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:31,220
yeah maybe drone is scared of you let's

00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:43,300
let's try it again I told you not to

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:45,740
blink oh now you killed it okay cool I

00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,380
doesn't have enough brainwaves from you

00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:53,800
sorry

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:59,690
[Laughter]

00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,690
[Applause]

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:10,610
come on now I need to land it at least

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,490
should have landed it need to pair and

00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:24,430
yeah come on

00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:24,430
I'm connecting two years okay

00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:44,690
now let's try to land it from here

00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:44,690
come on what is the land thing okay okay

00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:59,249
cool so so what's my point

00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:01,460
what's the purpose of all this right

00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:03,989
like why we are controlling drones

00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:08,160
controlling webpages with our mind why

00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:12,289
would are we doing this stuff right the

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:16,979
main the main takeaway from the talk as

00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:20,760
the future is already here and you are

00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:23,839
the ones to build it thank you

00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,839
[Applause]

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:41,619
does anyone have any questions like how

00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:43,240
the like how the I like I'm

00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:45,819
the only thing that broke was the react

00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,440
tab yeah like everything worked where

00:41:45,819 --> 00:41:50,380
react was like no you

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,100
you didn't say you keys properly so I'm

00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:56,400
gonna yeah yeah the warning of the keys

00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:00,819
[Laughter]

00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,369
is fine but your keys bro that's what my

00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:07,140
point is should we develop web app so

00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:10,150
should we look at the different things I

00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,789
love you I've just got one question can

00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:16,720
we buy they here I am yeah can we play

00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:21,279
Mario Kart with it upstairs if you want

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,880
to spend the day both in that sure now

00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:27,849
seriously if if you have a Bluetooth

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,430
connection to Mario Kart you can totally

00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,380
get the data analyze the data and it's

00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:35,950
not only web Bluetooth it basically it

00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,960
has the Bluetooth Low Energy and every

00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,920
device it can connect to bluetooth low

00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,819
energy basically can call different

00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,799
characteristics or subscribe to

00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:47,109
different crystal characteristics on the

00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:49,029
device so you can embed that into the

00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:51,970
webpage you can embed that into like

00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:57,279
mobile game VR game AR games regular

00:42:51,970 --> 00:43:03,880
game not game anything I don't think it

00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:05,950
works on a switch though it is I mean

00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,349
but Nintendo's very I'm not sure they

00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:11,079
like it you need to upgrade the firmware

00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:13,299
and like inject their connector to the

00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:18,940
thing but it's a good idea for over

00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:25,930
product yeah yeah anyone else got

00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:27,400
anything it's someone I think no I think

00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:33,150
they were just doing like scratching or

00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:38,150
something okay so three two one

00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:44,880
oh yeah sorry it's on github yeah

00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:51,539
so who's gonna publish the code to

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:55,910
github yeah so it's somewhere you're not

00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:58,519
using your screen oh sorry

00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,690
let's connect you just find his github

00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:05,460
yeah

00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:08,069
that's but this is the repo all the code

00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,440
there you can play around with that you

00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:14,880
also can you have the links to the both

00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,730
devices where someone can buy them on

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,900
Amazon you just like search form use

00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:23,009
it's all music remember the name of the

00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:30,869
device that's the problem

00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:33,240
okay let's mine control is not it's

00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:35,640
controlling okay let me just add a tool

00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:45,380
a slide so we all have this in the in

00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:51,119
the slides so this is the repo device is

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:54,390
years and the drone is basically every

00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:59,099
drone but like it's like parrot Mambo

00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,499
strong yeah yeah I mean does it look

00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:04,289
like Mambo

00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:07,489
that's why smart more it will actually

00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:09,660
work with their like this company

00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:10,859
release bunch of drones like a rolling

00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,799
spider or something like that weird

00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:17,789
names so they the exact same code will

00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:24,660
work with them as well so yeah it sounds

00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:25,890
like strains of weed the u.s. sells the

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,089
