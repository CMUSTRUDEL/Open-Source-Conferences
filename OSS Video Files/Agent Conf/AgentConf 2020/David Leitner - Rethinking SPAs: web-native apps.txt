[Laughter]

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,299
really really shitty clickbait title

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,140
that's true yeah I didn't know how to

00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:52,500
how to call it honestly we thinking SPR

00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,540
that's what it that's what it got yeah

00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:00,489
let's let's start with the short story

00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:03,159
yeah so I I started my first job as a

00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:05,950
web developer in 2009 actually yeah this

00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,229
is more than ten years ago as a student

00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:12,100
in a small company and of course what we

00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:14,740
did back then was GTA right everybody

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:17,430
used GTR Ichigo was great at its time it

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,920
solved a lot of issues we had it

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,010
actually fixed different bits between

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,380
the browsers that's what was its USP so

00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,480
we really liked it it made us a lot

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:31,630
faster it increased our developer

00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,240
velocity we could say and and we were

00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,360
happy with it and I remember good is

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,740
which company in in in 2011 and there

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,560
was another framework which was called

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,200
knock out I don't know if you've you

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:49,870
know maybe knock out it was one of the

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,900
first mic form of the first MVP or MV

00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:55,540
whatever not really sure about it

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,820
frameworks and it was really really cool

00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,310
because it it changed our way of

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,470
thinking about JavaScript right till

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,659
then javascript was hacking the Dom this

00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:07,090
is what we what we did with JavaScript

00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:09,849
and we snockered we first realized or at

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,709
least we as a team back then first

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,019
realized JavaScript is much more light

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,599
we can really write full applications

00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,580
only in JavaScript right and I think

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,159
lots of people started to think like

00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,079
this with early adopters like knockout

00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:25,560
and a lot of frameworks like ember GS

00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,270
backbone share started at this time

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,709
and we found out okay javascript is

00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:34,260
really powerful there and then in 2012 I

00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:36,120
again worked in another company so at

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,930
this time I switch companies very often

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,180
and they used the angularjs there and I

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,580
remember like yesterday I said to my

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,350
colleague oh my god how could we ever

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,670
have build applications without

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,459
angularjs right

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,200
I was bliss amazed back then I said this

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,270
is the way how I want to do it forever

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,670
right it felt so much easier so much

00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:59,070
simpler back then and I was really

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,800
enthusiastic about angularjs pectin my

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,800
first conference actually was in 2014 at

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,989
ng-europe I was a big fan of angularjs

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,000
and I went there the problem was at this

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,620
conference media minor the core

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,690
contributor van Gogh Luce said okay we

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,220
will not continue working on angularjs

00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,350
anymore we'll replace it with something

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,840
else so they stopped a little bit my

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,940
enthusiasm about angularjs but it's fine

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,420
it gave me the possibility to move

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,630
forward to direct mainly in 2015 and I

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,040
stick to it of course we did all the

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,810
other frameworks also because some

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,579
clients won't want also do games or

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,280
futures and Angola and is that the big

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,019
story I would say right so why do I tell

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,989
you this why do I tell you my personal

00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,860
JavaScript history right it's not not so

00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:47,090
different maybe I like to bond from you

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:55,109
well in this area

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:58,790
Wow I got this new thing actually in

00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:02,609
this era between 2012 and 2015 right in

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,560
2016 I got an email I got an email from

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,920
her from a friend of mine who respect

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,810
and c2 at the big insurance company

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,200
actually and he wrote an email and said

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,489
hey David we need project support we are

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,700
currently considering to migrate our

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:20,690
project from angularjs to react right do

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,890
you have capacity to consult us in this

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,539
and there are two interesting things in

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,880
this email right the first one is do we

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,100
have capacity to consult us right okay

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,599
yeah I was was freelancing back then I

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,630
said yeah sure sure have capacity I work

00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:38,400
now for Foursquare solutions as a lead

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,449
engineer and as a hey come on write an

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,979
email there they will tell you

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,900
I have capacity right so this is the

00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,460
easy part do we have capacity right I

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,770
don't have a problem with this question

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,809
but the harder part is do you want to

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,319
consult us during emigration from

00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:56,309
angularjs to react right so the first

00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,650
question is who does this fresh who

00:04:56,309 --> 00:05:01,469
thinks it's a good idea to migrate a

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,240
project from angularjs to react right he

00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,770
couldn't even migrate from angularjs to

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,389
angular right how should you even

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,210
migrate from angular choose to react

00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,589
right so the first thing I saw when I

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,159
got this email I said okay let's do it

00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:13,159
like this right

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,720
[Laughter]

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:24,029
but I have this problem in my brain

00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:25,949
right so every time I hear something I

00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,439
think okay this sounds challenging I

00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,150
start to like it right and and that's

00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,560
the same thing what I did there right I

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,139
said okay angularjs to react sounds

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,930
totally stupid sounds totally impossible

00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,870
maybe I should should should try it yeah

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,789
me we should really try to do this and

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,849
so we had this huge application

00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:49,620
angularjs more than 7000 components it

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,199
was really massive I've never seen a

00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,069
massive application back then yeah like

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,349
this six people two and a half years

00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:04,939
worked on this so far so what could we

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:07,620
do of course minor refactorings right

00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:10,589
shifting a few bits going in an

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,389
iterative approach no we said hey let's

00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,360
burn this and let's build it from

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:18,419
scratch right that's what it is I like I

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,599
like this link I love it fantastic

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,219
that's what we did and we really wasted

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,039
a lot of money actually that's what you

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:28,620
see now all right this is exactly what

00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,870
we did yeah we spent actually a ton of

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,399
money because we said okay we need to

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,759
rebuild this and at this point in time

00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,249
it it made somehow sense we said okay

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,199
there is no way to migrate from Angola

00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:42,719
cheers to react we cannot even do this

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,550
right there are no code more codemod

00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,680
says there's nothing well there's total

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,579
different concepts how should we do this

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,260
right so we did this and the project was

00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,020
quite successful

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,240
I was really happy actually about the

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,000
rear sorry about the about the result of

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,590
this project so I helped him for four

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,930
five months or something like this and

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,420
after those five months we already hit

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:10,200
the first beta version online so it

00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,570
really went very very good and and I

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,580
moved on then went to other projects and

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,170
then this summer and this is why I'm

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,060
actually standing here this is why I'm

00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,860
doing this tour because it's or it would

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,530
be maybe an interesting story to share

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,930
this summer I got a email another one

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,450
from the same guy he wrote me hey David

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,280
we we could again need your support we

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,480
were stuck with reactive version Co

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:37,220
searching alright this is a version from

00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,220
2015 or 2016 something like this yeah

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,200
and he said there actually that the main

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,910
problem is that they didn't find

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,560
developers anymore who want to do this

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,030
stuff right this is actually the main

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,700
problem if you stick with traditional

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,990
versions right and we have no clear

00:07:50,700 --> 00:08:05,910
vision how to migrate to 16 okay cool

00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:14,070
good good yeah I mean it's just a story

00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:15,530
yeah so at this time as this summer this

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,210
spring actually when I got this email

00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,780
the the application had more than 10,000

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,950
components yeah but I said okay

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,390
migrating from one framework version to

00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,850
another framework version of how hard

00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:30,510
can it be right yeah should not be that

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:32,580
hard yeah this is what I saw this is

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:37,229
what really happened yeah this is me out

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,060
even I said it's a perfect name for the

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,910
snowboarding or skiing conference right

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,430
so this is us right and the snow is

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:47,390
actually the snow it's basically webpack

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:50,040
yeah all the time

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,870
we're back and all that they inherited

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,940
dependencies we got in this project yeah

00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,730
so actually and then also some some

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,040
breaking changes in react itself but but

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,560
mainly this whole stuff around yeah this

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,420
is tons of dependencies which didn't fit

00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,310
in anymore after migration and sounds

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,170
like this

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:11,279
so again shitty right so what do we do

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,760
with a 10,000 components react.js

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:24,100
application version C without searching

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:26,620
any ideas to get here yeah well let's

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,959
jump back to this to this slide maybe it

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,310
this makes all sense why I gave you this

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:36,000
kind introduction yeah well if you take

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:38,500
a look at this slide what would those

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,300
frameworks mostly have in common is that

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:45,370
they are dead right and and I don't

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,810
think that I don't want to I don't want

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,220
to blame any of those frameworks oh

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,290
really that's not my intention I like

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,410
all of them Chico is great it was really

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,019
great back in its days angularjs is

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,480
still it made a big step in in the way

00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:01,000
of how we created web frameworks or how

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,829
we created web apps yeah but they are

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,720
dead of course people will say my is not

00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:07,360
dead yeah I know it's not that they're

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,899
til working on it but how many new

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,959
projects using my right it's just not

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,819
the thing any three okay

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,130
maybe and again I don't say that anybody

00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:20,319
spared I I don't say died because it was

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,360
bad but that's not the saying what I'm

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:24,819
saying yeah but it's it's not really a

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,769
thing anymore right so why do all these

00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:30,430
frameworks actually die that's the

00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:33,699
question right so the life of a web

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,170
framework this is for sure a question

00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,690
you had in your life how does the life

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:41,380
of that framework look like right so it

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,089
starts when it gets born at some point

00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,209
in time somebody thinks okay we have a

00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:48,010
problem at the certain point in time and

00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:49,829
we want to solve it let's let's build a

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,819
framework it sounds like a good idea

00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:54,190
so somebody creates these frameworks

00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:56,980
lots of commit sent and the framework

00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:00,069
rose but the important thing on this

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,139
slide is not the framework line it's

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:06,459
this error here right because this is

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:09,100
the web platform okay and at some point

00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:11,889
in time the gap between the web

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:15,339
framework and the web platform gets huge

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:18,019
right and this is what actually eager

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:22,160
miner said in 2014 at this engine

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:24,559
he said we cannot keep track of the web

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,939
platform anymore we cannot support

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,829
angularjs anymore because the web

00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:32,660
involved in a way that we cannot support

00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:34,999
this with our all the assumptions are

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,329
all thinking right and this is what to

00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:40,189
all those dead frameworks helped happen

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,069
right they died because the gap between

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:44,720
the web platform and the framework

00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:47,420
itself get too big and when the web

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,569
platform starts to move on when we for

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,920
example have ACMA script modules right

00:11:49,569 --> 00:11:54,290
then why do you need a module system in

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,139
angular right makes no sense most of the

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,029
time and at this point in time we cannot

00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:00,949
keep track of the web platform anymore

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,769
we cannot use the natural features we

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:06,290
get in the web platform anymore and the

00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:09,049
frame forgets legacy right this is what

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,679
happens most of the time so what to do

00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:14,660
all right

00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:18,739
what why did we act actually survive

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:20,839
that long because in my opinion rect had

00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:23,360
this had this big advantage of very

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,759
staying very very close to Travis could

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,829
be all the time right

00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,259
this was always the main design idea to

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:32,209
stay wary to stick very close to that to

00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,949
the core fundamentals of JavaScript I

00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,869
always say if you learn Angela you need

00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,579
to learn angular right if you learn

00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:39,529
react you need to learn JavaScript right

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:41,720
because if you learn angular you need to

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,069
learn all these crazy directives and

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,779
things which you put in the Dom

00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:46,990
somewhere but if you learn to react it's

00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:49,879
more less just to render function yeah

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:52,309
so that's why I think in my opinion

00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:54,470
survive that long and this is quite a

00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:57,410
library reactor right here

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,089
and the problem is frameworks work until

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,529
they hit the frame yeah I like to saying

00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:02,569
I don't know who did it but but I

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:05,179
remember it and it's really like this

00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:06,679
they work until you hit the frame and at

00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:08,869
some point in time you hit the frame it

00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,339
will stop working yeah they will not

00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:13,160
support you any more than what you're

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:14,989
doing and so it's always the same thing

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,989
right we have this old stuff whatever it

00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:21,739
is I really just wanted to just claim

00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:24,049
this again I don't want to blame here

00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:26,299
any framework or anybody I just say we

00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:28,129
have this old stuff and usually we burn

00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:30,279
it and rebuild it right that's what we

00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,279
do

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,730
does anybody know the Netscape story

00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:43,060
really can you put your hands up

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,350
oh it's good so the Netscape story I

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,860
will tell it further for the rest is

00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,540
very shortly so do Netscape Netscape is

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,550
the same for everybody was there was a

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,800
big browser back then actually he

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,840
enabled us to do JavaScript or he

00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,100
enabled the way how JavaScript involved

00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,470
so in 1996 there was version 4 of

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,230
Netscape which was the the main Prowse

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:09,430
80% of the users used version 4 of

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:12,040
Netscape back then and the Netscape team

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,560
was trying to build a new version and

00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,590
what they say is ok we have a lot of

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,560
technical depth here we cannot move on

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,200
with this version with this fundament

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,200
of Netscape we need to rebuild it we

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,580
need a complete rewrite right and

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,440
somebody they somehow they did they

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,710
convinced management to say ok we need

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,080
to rewrite this right and then there was

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,780
Netscape version 6 so there was not even

00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,950
a version 5 which was released in 2000

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,280
ok

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:45,220
so four years four years no new Netscape

00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,440
version so what does this mean if you

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,190
don't release for years a version a new

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,570
version of the product

00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:57,220
Firefox didn't win unfortunately

00:14:52,570 --> 00:15:00,160
bacteria Safari else one I don't know

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,300
how to mention its name but it doesn't

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,430
matter yeah of course

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,530
other products start to use this time

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,970
and involve and then people start to

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,610
look left and right and say ok we use

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,680
something else right and and this is a

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,690
figure of the of the of the user G of

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,580
Netscape right and here you see that the

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,700
face when they were developing or

00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:20,410
redeveloping the new version right so

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,720
once it hit the market that the market

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,790
was already gone there and this is why

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,890
Netscape died actually because they said

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:30,339
ok we will in a Big Bang rewrite this

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,050
whole thing because this framework the

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,060
technologies we are building up on

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,680
doesn't doesn't fit to the assumptions

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,990
anymore doesn't fit the technology

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,720
doesn't fit the purpose doesn't fit the

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,060
needs anymore

00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,770
so again this old stat xTag whatever

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,740
disease we replace it with a new tech

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:49,810
stick right so what to do what to do is

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,710
our 10,000 components direct application

00:15:49,810 --> 00:16:06,810
right just looking if she didn't fall

00:15:53,710 --> 00:16:06,810
off the table again so what did you well

00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,590
just stop using frameworks this is what

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:16,210
one of the guys said in the meetings and

00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:17,890
ended the beginning the problem with

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:20,050
this meme is that everything looks smart

00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:23,230
in this meme yeah even if somebody says

00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:27,070
stop using frameworks right but then we

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:32,290
went out for a few beers not too many

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:34,600
honestly honestly not too many and and

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,880
we were thinking about what what this

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,460
idea of not using a framework at all

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,950
just just sticking to pure JavaScript or

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:43,390
whatever we have right and the

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,610
discussion involves and we said okay

00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,290
actually it didn't daddy is interesting

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,150
yeah you know that the problem in the

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,840
brain it sounds interesting let's let's

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,610
talk about this right and then we met on

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,620
a whiteboard of course everybody meets

00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:58,600
on white pause with Swiss post-its these

00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,950
days so we met on a whiteboard with

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,630
post-its and we said okay what do we

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,920
actually gain from a framework what are

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,130
the advantages we get from aggie

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,540
framework first of all componentry from

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,950
development that's that's the obvious

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,110
point right this is what all those

00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:14,200
frameworks brought us the brawler's way

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:17,610
to not build huge webpages anymore but

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,750
to compose our web apps with components

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,760
component composition you could say

00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,700
right so start with a small component

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,830
combine it together and get pages and

00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,690
then whole apps by doing this this whole

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:30,880
way of component within development

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:35,230
emerged from single page applications

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,420
right before we did more pinching nation

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,940
stylish driven development whatever

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:43,650
whatever to call it here so this is a

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,900
obvious point but it's also obvious that

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,550
this USP it is this unique selling

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,620
proposition from from single page

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,760
applications to support us in component

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,050
we even developed

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,610
we could say it's not needed anymore

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:01,340
right because ah sorry this is coming

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,410
later yeah so let's let's finish the

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:05,180
post-its first right so another thing

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,640
what what frameworks you will bring as a

00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,590
state management yeah most of the

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,120
frameworks have an opinion at least or

00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,770
also have some implementations to

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,520
support us in managing global or local

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:18,560
state right if you think of react we

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,300
have for local state no hooks and and

00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,760
for global stakes we can we can usually

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:25,310
use read actual stuff like this in Agra

00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,140
lights anyway in futures components

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,080
anyway state full and and so result

00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,710
stateful so there is anyway inherited

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,210
state more less we usually also have

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,250
dependency injection or in all

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,930
frameworks but some sometimes people

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,490
really like this concept so if IOC

00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,990
containers and that's why they move on

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,600
to frameworks and say ok this is a

00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,190
benefit now that guy's say the router

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,560
and that's true yeah most of the

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,870
frameworks canvas routers these

00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,550
reporters in composing our applications

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,130
they mainly also support us in lazy

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:58,520
loading different parts of our

00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,930
applications another guy said CLI so

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,750
they come with the sea lion that's a big

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,280
point actually yeah see lies in my

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,370
opinion the big point for frameworks

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,800
yeah so you can scaffold whole fewer

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,990
angular or react applications just by a

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,520
few clicks or by a few commands yeah and

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,950
that's amazing actually

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,750
so this gives us again a lot of speed as

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:23,000
developers yeah and then when we had

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,430
this five posters we said okay what else

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,620
okay we said maybe bundler maybe some

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:29,750
kind of compiler transpiler but it's

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,820
somehow part of the CLI lazy loading as

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,100
I mentioned earlier it's anyway part of

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,930
the route are usually so what else and

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,790
we didn't found that much anymore right

00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:39,110
we said okay these are mainly the points

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,010
which we get from this single page

00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:45,440
application frameworks so again we said

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,770
how hard can it be right how hard can it

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,180
be to do this result framework right and

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,340
then we were going to do post it's

00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,200
already started before okay now this was

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,770
all artists are this was our hash tag

00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,450
very independent yeah really religious

00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,130
about this yeah let's try to do this

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:04,140
with other framework

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:08,010
we were thinking about this a lot back

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,890
then and when we went through these

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:12,450
components to this to support it sorry

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,430
we started again with componentry from

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,620
development yeah and as I said this was

00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:19,710
one of the EU's piece of SPS right this

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:21,240
is why we love them actually why we

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,070
started also to love them because it

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,880
changed the way how we develop web

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:30,170
applications and the interesting thing

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,309
is that somehow we could say this use PF

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,140
isn't needed anymore

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,000
because it's it's part of the web

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,640
platform now right we have web

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,650
components so we can do this without a

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,179
framework we can say okay we just use

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,450
web components they are natively

00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,160
available on the web and I know people

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,559
are saying okay web components there's

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,940
this great post from from from very

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,320
chairs who says well I don't use web

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,660
components web components I'm not so

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,140
good this post is great I fully agree I

00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,270
like it a lot but what he actually says

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,890
or what most of the criticism about web

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:04,170
components is is that if you go to web

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,820
components to talk that's the resource

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:09,630
page of web components and if you go

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,100
there and say hey so I I just summarized

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,170
the article and you don't have to read

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,630
it

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,280
disable JavaScript here reload the page

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,450
and you will see nothing right this is

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,030
what the criticism about web components

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,880
is and I can understand this yeah this

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,309
could be better but on the other hand

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,050
how how many single page applications do

00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:30,900
you see if you disable JavaScript right

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:33,330
so it's somehow somehow the same problem

00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:35,460
so for us it was not an issue we said

00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,200
okay web components are fine but we

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,550
don't want to build them with a booster

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,670
natively pairs we use something like

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,920
sketches or a stencil or spelter which

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,429
also compiles or transpires - web

00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,250
components yeah notice the libraries

00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:52,820
these are not frameworks we will talk

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,150
about this in a second yeah

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,530
the difference between a framework is an

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,780
elaborate that the framework tells you

00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:03,120
what to do in the library you tell a

00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:06,300
library what to do right so it's the bit

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,260
inverse direction yeah but we will come

00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,420
to this in a second

00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,070
so for component weaving development we

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,770
had solutions right we had solutions

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:16,020
actually directly from the web platform

00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,910
for global state management we were of

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,760
course thinking like like Redux and flux

00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,110
here and there there are actually some

00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,540
some implementation for different

00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,160
frameworks but we wanted to stay

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,679
technology agnostic so we sought about

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,050
akita which is not really a Redux

00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,750
implementation it's more like repository

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:36,059
pattern but I liked it a lot back then

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,429
but then we said okay what about Alex

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,620
cheers right and so I said okay I see

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:43,980
the streaming library what is it to do

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,170
with state management and and we at

00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,290
least our our point is that the dikes

00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:52,950
giasses if you use access subjects also

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,480
streams more or less it feels a little

00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,970
bit like Redux without the whole

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,980
ceremony art here you can you can use it

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,559
quite good you can use streams quite

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,660
good as global state management tools

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,570
and that's what we were thinking about

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,570
to just use pure IGS here to manage our

00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:11,550
global State down then about the CLI

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,500
this was the trickiest part is something

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,179
which is called hydrogen which I which I

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,640
used back in the days I was not fully

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:20,370
happy about it so we we wanted actually

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,960
to do don't go into detail about this

00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,420
discussion then somebody said angle is

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,350
Eli right and I said okay just another

00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:30,270
after favor okay angle is Eli cool thank

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,160
you but we need something which is

00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,230
technology agnostic and and he said no

00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,880
but angular CLI sports I'm something

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,410
which is called schematics and with

00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,540
schematics you can define your own

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:42,150
templates you can do whatever you want

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,500
actually and then he did some some

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,000
prototyping and he came up with a

00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,429
solution where he defined a few

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,880
schematics and and we're really careful

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:53,370
our projects without any angle line

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,559
there right so we really just used a CLI

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,330
generation tool on for scaffolding and

00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,790
eternal to do work really really well

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,280
there they started to use these tools on

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,110
the backhand side for a micro service

00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,380
architecture so this was really success

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:10,230
story I'm gonna see ela here dependency

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,820
injection well there is not really

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:14,820
something in my opinion which which

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,650
works there's inverted TGS which is kind

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,690
of kind of old-school and and we just

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,600
said okay then try it without it yeah

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,450
let's let's let's let's keep it away

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,890
yeah let's let's don't do it and then we

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,389
were thinking about the route and

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,159
there's a

00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:32,459
really nice library about the route oh

00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,200
there's library which is called Fadi

00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:36,179
Naruto I don't know if you know Vardhan

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,200
maybe some people with a Java background

00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:42,029
know it and it is actually a client-side

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,429
routing for web components so all you do

00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:46,799
is you define a small you download a

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:48,959
small library you bind it to outlets and

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,509
then you define your routes and it has a

00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:53,459
few neat features we need it so of

00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:55,469
course or all the classical stuff like I

00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:57,629
like like child routes and stuff like

00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:59,849
this and parameters and all these things

00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,649
but for us it's a really big application

00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:04,139
it was important that we supported some

00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:05,849
kind of lazy loading yeah so you can

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:07,889
define a bundle and based on this bundle

00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:09,599
you loads the component or the bundle

00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:13,049
then when you really hit this path here

00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:15,089
and first this was a perfect fit yeah so

00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:19,559
we said okay let's go with this let's

00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:21,570
really try it as as small as possible

00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,839
with these things here so we had

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,769
component driven development was web

00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,289
components with global state management

00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:31,139
with access where a CLI kind of a CLI

00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:32,249
and we had a route with the web

00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:40,320
component route

00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:43,079
okay goods beg again that sounds a nice

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,570
yeah this is really a nice idea well how

00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,729
do you want to do this here right so

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,409
again where did possibility Big Bang or

00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:51,779
somehow I need to go different culture

00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:55,200
and and I think we learn from the past

00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,820
and and we saw okay we must we must find

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,309
something majority if we cannot do this

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,469
again any more people will kill us if we

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,389
do this again yeah so let's let's think

00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:09,079
of something else what we did actually

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:13,139
we did a lot of there's latency actually

00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:14,999
we draw a lot of white pot singing about

00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:17,669
our application actually every picture

00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:19,639
we draw at the same result here we have

00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:22,379
a big ball of not right this was the

00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:25,379
ultimate result of all these drawings

00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:27,690
yeah this is really this felt like

00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:29,369
spaghetti it doesn't taste like this but

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,700
it feels like this always glued together

00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:34,109
add its and then we did a lot of you

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,879
know this tomato from design and

00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,159
thinking about the Quartermaine's and

00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:40,280
bounded context stuff and then it worked

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,010
out good we said okay we

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,900
a small part which we can really take

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,140
out right and start with our new

00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:50,169
approach this was the user the user

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,960
profile so it was an e-commerce platform

00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:57,020
and and quite huge one I guess maybe you

00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,780
even used it already so it's it's really

00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:02,030
in production and we really had to think

00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,070
a lot about the domain and I never

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:07,160
worked in the e-commerce domain until

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,200
then and we really have to think what

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,730
what can we can we take out and we

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,940
started with the whole user profile and

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,290
the whole user editing Floria so we took

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,110
this thing here and said okay that's

00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,640
that's it let's try to get it out we

00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,710
just linked it with some hyperlink

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,940
moreless to the old application and they

00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,860
said okay let's take it out let's

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,630
rebuild it or let's migrate it to our

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,400
new stack and we used to filter it and

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,429
roll up and it really worked fine right

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:33,290
and sometimes in the in the life of

00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:35,030
programming you have this feeling when

00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,250
you type into the keyboard and it feels

00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,110
good right you know what I mean right

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,140
you sometimes have this if you if you

00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,790
design a class this or if you if you

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,470
build something and it feels really good

00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,870
right you can't really explain it but it

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,900
felt really really good and we did this

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,309
in one sprint actually so we really

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,320
achieve this in in two weeks we of

00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:57,260
course what a great and enthusiastic and

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,880
and we did this here and it felt so good

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,190
that we said okay we want to continue

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,190
with this yeah and this this application

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,620
itself has a huge problem for for search

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,870
engine optimization as most of those arm

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,720
legacy single page application projects

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,669
have and we said okay let's let's tackle

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,540
this issue so hold is this customer

00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:23,210
public facing landing pages stuff yeah

00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:25,580
so we tried to oh sorry for forcing we

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,500
extracted all this stuff of causing in a

00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,299
component libraries web component so so

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,870
as I mentioned swelter compares to web

00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,520
component so we started to build up in

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,110
component library yeah and the next

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,850
thing was just landing stuff and and I

00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:42,260
usually don't say this and I usually

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:44,390
don't don't say I love frameworks but we

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,040
said okay let's let's go with Gatsby

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:49,100
because this is the perfect fit

00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,809
whirlwind ETA and I was never more happy

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,340
about a decision I did in my

00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:53,350
professional life when it comes to

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,360
technologies

00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,580
and that gets me was really perfect here

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,020
we said okay we cannot use this web

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,970
components here because this doesn't

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,679
really fit under the aesthetic and page

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,730
generation and and web components this

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,440
didn't work out at least back then and

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,940
we really we really just said okay let's

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,250
let's make it more or less an

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:15,160
independence things get speedy they have

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:17,260
their own component library it's the the

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,970
search engine optimize a search engine

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,559
optimized components and here we have

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,480
more like the internal stuff if the

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,299
users already locked in there and we

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,659
continued with this we continued a lot

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:31,090
and then we had this product details

00:29:28,659 --> 00:29:33,220
stuff so this whole products clicking on

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,190
products writing the refused writing

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:39,429
comments and steady other so we were

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,840
just a small team of five people which

00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,940
we're doing this this kind of

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,039
prototyping here actually and there the

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,480
other teams look to us and said hey we

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,190
also want to do this right because it

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,530
feels so fast what you're doing of

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,419
course right this is stuff this is not a

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,580
big surprise if you work in a legacy

00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:56,740
react application it's 10,000 components

00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,659
whatever you do afterwards feels fast

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,460
right you can start to write pure

00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:02,679
JavaScript for Internet Explorer 7 and

00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:05,350
it will feel fast again right and it

00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,150
really of course it was faster yeah it's

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,280
clear and they said okay we need to also

00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,470
dig into this and then is it but we

00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,419
actually we don't want to go this world

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,150
what you proposed we want to go with

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:18,159
Angola and said okay doesn't really fit

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:19,630
our philosophy it's a framework we

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,100
actually want to get a little bit rid of

00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:23,710
them but okay

00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:26,470
I mean who am i right if the team wants

00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,020
to go with a framework if the teams is

00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:31,929
we have capabilities in this framework

00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,730
we know how this framework works they

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,350
should decide right I don't like that

00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,690
that framework decisions are always made

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,610
by people who are fast away from from

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,440
the keyborad people who work with this

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,600
stuff should decide what they should to

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,220
and then we said yeah let's let's go do

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,570
whatever you want actually all we need

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,919
from you is a web component at the end

00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,289
because we need to plug it in our

00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,350
component route right so they went with

00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,940
angular they're actually turn out to be

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,539
quite nice because to use the angular

00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,340
elements and expose the whole episode we

00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:02,070
could

00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,809
simply put it in our roots all right and

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,730
they used our web components which we

00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:08,100
started to build here and we started to

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:11,010
merge things together and the component

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,049
library grew right and then we keep them

00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,940
going and we we started to migrate other

00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:18,510
parts of the problem after of the

00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:22,620
problem of the project yeah we just hype

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,970
up this also a very nice library of

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,090
course you could say okay why did you

00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,429
stop now yeah we like to try it honestly

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:31,049
sir life is too short to not try out

00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,210
things and hi babe is also very cool

00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:36,299
it's it's another micro framework and

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,460
it's it's really very tiny and what we

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,350
used of course hi babe with some web

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,870
components and little bit of Alex Cheers

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:46,860
and this was super super fast again yeah

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:49,559
and after this we we said okay actually

00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,419
we see a pattern here right so let's say

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,490
we're using web components as our

00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,230
component library so the reusable

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,179
component should all be web components

00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,890
you can write them with whatever you

00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:00,720
want to do right you can write them with

00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:03,120
hi babe you can write in this filter you

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,240
can write them with stencil whatever you

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,220
wanted to but they shouldn't increase a

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,960
specific size they should be a small and

00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,690
tiny but at the end it must be web

00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,970
component right tensley we said okay

00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,559
between the communication here when this

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:19,770
application more or less wants to

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,140
communicate with this one it's done open

00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,539
and read extreme so we had a few streams

00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,429
actually for well documented even in

00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,110
typescript so we knew words messages

00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:30,179
will be put in there and how we can read

00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,280
them out and we said okay this is our

00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:35,490
global state manage more email in Wallis

00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,659
right and and this was just a tiny small

00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,240
area Cheers

00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,690
yeah and then we had a beautiful a web

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,480
component router right it just took the

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,010
the the positive and and returned the

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,500
web component and it could be a very

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:51,150
small stencil component or it could be

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,960
the whole angular application as one

00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,909
component right

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,159
we didn't care they did of course their

00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:58,679
own internal routing and after specific

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,820
based path but it worked really nice

00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,039
together huh and this is how we wanted

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,490
to get rid of this big ball of not right

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,870
and we explaining this to people and

00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,850
then summarize it okay

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:15,910
congratulations this is JavaScript fat

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,700
right you're back in the game from 2018

00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,290
yeah so you have tons of frameworks

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,970
nobody knows actually what you're using

00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,290
your using hi pipe and I heard about

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:24,910
this what is this yeah

00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:26,950
why didn't you smelter why don't you

00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:29,020
just use a reactor angle or futures

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,400
right what everybody else is using and

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:33,250
this is of course a very valid point

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,460
yeah the technology footprint of this of

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:39,370
this whole application architecture is

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:41,470
amazing you can start to use whatever

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,210
you want here right nobody tells you

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,940
don't use it yeah at the end we must

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,650
have a web component yeah and and of

00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,480
course this is a real problem yeah

00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,130
because it's hard for people to shift

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:56,890
between those teams and and and and to

00:33:53,130 --> 00:34:01,570
to to help out us out there but first it

00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:03,850
was a this was a this was still a good

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:06,970
fit because we said we don't care

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:09,250
actually yeah I mean we we we think it's

00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,630
it's actually an advantage for people to

00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,400
have to freedom through use to right

00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,380
tool for what they want to do right

00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,850
and we said what we actually want to

00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:20,320
have we want to have an idiomatic

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:22,030
JavaScript right and if I if I come back

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,560
to the slide I had before this was the

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:25,210
framework problem right where we said

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,580
okay at some point in time the framework

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,110
getting too far away from the native fat

00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,260
platform and we cannot we cannot

00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:34,570
continue and it gets legacy and this is

00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,450
what actually we did right this is the

00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:39,400
web platform and we picked very very

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:43,000
small parts and said okay let's use a

00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,800
small set of libraries yeah and let's

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,430
start work with them yeah let's go with

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,230
Alex cheers yeah let's go with our web

00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:53,680
component route and go with other things

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:55,480
yeah and also use things which we got

00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,570
natively from the web platform right

00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,270
like web components and in lots of other

00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:03,100
things which will come yeah so did they

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:05,230
changed a lot yeah they will change a

00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,750
lot that there were service workers

00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,490
there were web components there will be

00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,930
represent us in the future I'm hundred

00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,690
percent sure yeah that web components

00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,460
will change the way how we will build

00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,910
web applications hundred percent sure

00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,370
yeah

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,950
is this will change a lot once it's

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,660
really it really has general

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,030
availability and it can manipulate the

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:26,109
Dom of course yeah it will change a lot

00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,509
how we

00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:30,309
build our web applications and and from

00:35:28,509 --> 00:35:32,019
this point of view we said okay we want

00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:34,539
to stay close to this right because we

00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:37,390
want to gain disadvantages what once web

00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:39,130
the same is available we want to not say

00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,900
okay we cannot use it because our

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:43,599
framework doesn't support us anymore we

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,069
want to stay close through a web

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,869
platform and that's what we actually

00:35:45,069 --> 00:35:52,809
tried to do yeah and this gives us a lot

00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:54,670
of flexibility of course based on two

00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:58,299
main reasons here this is actually the

00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:00,940
summary of the talk or we could say we

00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:03,009
can be polyglot you know we can as I

00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:06,009
said we have this JavaScript fatigue for

00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:07,900
sure but we can use the right to right

00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:09,849
tool for the job yeah we can really say

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,440
okay in this situation we want to use

00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:13,989
react in this situation you want to use

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,700
angular whatever fits best for the team

00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:17,859
whatever fits best for the problem and

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,710
the second thing we can be idiomatic

00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:22,930
right we are able to evolve with the web

00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:25,569
platform right so we don't have this

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,519
issue of saying okay we cannot wearisome

00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:29,799
how locked by a framework or somewhere

00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,200
locked by dependency we can really try

00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:35,470
to stick as close as possible to the web

00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:40,170
platform so maybe and this is the

00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:43,079
description of the talk title yeah maybe

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,789
let's rethink the impact of frameworks

00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,670
let's rethink the impact framework set

00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:51,549
on our web apps instead web native here

00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:53,769
so maybe maybe really start to sink what

00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:56,170
web platform already gives us these days

00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:58,720
yeah and maybe let think okay maybe we

00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,029
don't need this huge monolithic Alfredo

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,029
axe anymore right maybe we can just

00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:07,299
compose a few small bits and use the web

00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:10,059
platform itself so maybe let's stay

00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:12,690
weapon native and don't go who is

00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,690
frameworks

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:20,000
thank you very much my name is David

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:28,060
Lattin I hope this was useful

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:32,300
[Applause]

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:34,670
are you ready for questions I need a

00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:51,320
beer now yeah let's let's ask okay does

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:53,710
anyone have any questions yeah yeah I

00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,710
know

00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:01,040
it depends mainly on how you use them

00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:04,640
right so we made this clear decision for

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,890
everything which which must be seen by

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,200
by non-human people which maybe don't

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:12,770
have Java scripts which must be very

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,290
highly accessible are we doing biscuits

00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,119
P so we're really building a to static

00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:20,119
content that at build time already yeah

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,520
and for this stuff would usually see

00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,310
after login right where you can expect

00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,010
people to to have JavaScript we started

00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:32,060
to use web components so I think this

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:33,950
whole discussion about web components is

00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,530
a little bit too religious for me yeah

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:39,080
honestly that the problem is that they

00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,570
are not well supported or they were for

00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,790
long time not well supported in in in

00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,340
the reactor framework or indirect

00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:48,590
library that's why where people were

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,450
doing this kind of artificial fight in

00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:55,070
my opinion which which should have not

00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:57,109
been there but what I think it will for

00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,510
many use cases be a good fit yeah

00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:01,190
because why not yeah it's it's part of

00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,550
the wiper why why shouldn't we start to

00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,550
use it

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,079
does anyone else have any

00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:25,910
first of all Wow I'm blown away I think

00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:30,229
I feel like you under ng-europe

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:33,170
that I'm completely lost and my question

00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:35,719
is is this angular and Facebook and

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:40,339
could we know about your small movement

00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:41,779
is the FBI after you actually this is

00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:44,599
the first time I talked about it I

00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:48,019
didn't have time to post about it no I

00:39:44,599 --> 00:40:00,949
don't know I don't think so maybe Rick

00:39:48,019 --> 00:40:04,640
is here now Facebook maybe is disturbing

00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:07,219
me so maybe think it's rethink it or

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,449
should we or should we not I don't know

00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:12,890
what the goal was talk yeah I don't want

00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:15,109
to I don't want to tell you how you

00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,839
think how you should think yeah I don't

00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:20,660
I think this is you know we we it's

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,019
whoever mainly in a in a financial

00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,150
insurance ecommerce domain right is that

00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:28,549
this is huge applications this is really

00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:31,009
massive stuff this is very enterprises

00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:35,839
so in this area definitely makes sense

00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:38,209
to not go with one single framework for

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,680
such big applications in my opinion but

00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:42,199
if you're building something small and

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,869
you must really be fast yeah maybe

00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:47,390
reactor Angeles is for sure still a good

00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:49,339
fit because of course you have to charge

00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,869
good fatigue right you need to hang

00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:52,670
around the bandar-log and you need to

00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:54,890
hang around this way pecker wall up or

00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,049
whatever you use right it's not one

00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:59,420
out-of-the-box solution but it gives you

00:40:57,049 --> 00:41:01,729
the possibility to really take the best

00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,049
things you need and it allows you to

00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:05,509
evolve over time yeah

00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:08,089
so I think it's really a somewhere

00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:10,520
threshold there where it makes sense at

00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:13,410
a certain point

00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,240
offsides yeah and then first small of it

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,060
maybe doesn't there maybe it's really

00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,160
just better to go with one thing and is

00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:22,020
it anyway small it's maybe okay to

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,000
rewrite it in four or five years again

00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:30,650
yeah okay thanks does anyone else have

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,650
any questions we have time for one more

00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:46,740
yeah why I actually have this as a

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,090
single page application like yeah yeah

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,280
that's a good question actually this

00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,230
came maybe didn't came out too good and

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,240
this is still a single page application

00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:57,150
right this runs on one instance this has

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,609
one router which doesn't switch to page

00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:03,750
yeah so especially in this scenario it

00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:04,950
made made sense yeah but of course you

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,690
can also say you build different

00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,820
applications and just linked in with

00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,650
hyperlinks yeah then you usually have to

00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,270
problem of sharing State right how do

00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:13,650
you do this you can do this with cookie

00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:16,109
but then they must run on the same

00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:19,140
domain right so it's it's not so easy at

00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:21,030
this cause I didn't want to say this

00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,800
word actually but this goes a little bit

00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,540
into these microphones and discussions

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,880
right nobody actually knows about what

00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:31,950
it really is yeah and I I think this is

00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,540
this is on a very detailed level you

00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:36,089
have to make these decisions you have we

00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,830
decided to go really as in a single page

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:40,140
application still so as I said this

00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:42,690
whole you conversing works on one

00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:47,270
instance it share state over Vaughn

00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:50,369
redux sorry I guess stream yeah

00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:52,770
multiplies chess streams and and that

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,839
that's a little bit design of how we did

00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,140
it yeah but of course you could say okay

00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,990
just split into smaller applications

00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,460
yeah this is of course also possibility

00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,800
but then of course it's it's just

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,750
different applications yeah and this is

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,700
an impact on the usability this is an

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,380
impact of the look and feel if you if

00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,390
you start to split it up with all these

00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:16,109
hyperlink round-trips again yeah okay

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:20,040
yeah go David

00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:22,720
you can breathe now you can go to sleep

00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,240
that's exactly what I will do thank you

00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,000
very much

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,000
