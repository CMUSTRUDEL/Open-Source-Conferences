I just feel like it's a very community

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,910
driven conference it also is a lot of

00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,769
quality and people are just nice hi my

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,730
name's Sarah and this is agent comp in

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,420
Dortmund

00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,099
[Music]

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,500
amazing venue Austria is beautiful

00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:25,300

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:33,040
and getting to go and hang out and ski

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:33,040
[Music]

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,180
right

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,480
thank you Sarah and Thank You agent conf

00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,250
and to all the sponsors and made it to

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,479
Austria

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:50,140
so at Jared Palmer on Twitter let's get

00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:51,640
into it so I have this podcast with Ken

00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,739
wheeler and it's great that's pretty

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,449
funny and if you like to if you're

00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,110
interested in JavaScript development and

00:00:55,449 --> 00:01:02,260
walk like listening to to like

00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,360
drink and talk about JavaScript this is

00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,450
your podcast there's a two-drink minimum

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,850
so we have a good amount of fun with it

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,369
so I also make some memes I know the

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:16,869
sounds gonna play but let's let's see if

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:28,540
this will play I think a lot of memes on

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:32,080
Twitter that was a gem yeah they make

00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,250
adult or means - I ran an agency for

00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,540
five years and along the way I sort of

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,980
convinced my clients that I could open

00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,320
source all the stuff that wasn't really

00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:44,050
relevant to their like competitive

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,810
advantage and so we built apps and

00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,250
software and services for large fortune

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,140
500 companies and along the way I

00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,600
open-source to whatever I could

00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,780
basically so if like Razzles a build

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,580
system for like SSR it's kinda like next

00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,440
j/s but less framework ii

00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,510
backpacks have built system for lambdas

00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,620
after j/s does like next chest data

00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,570
fetching with react router react definis

00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,009
like utility belt

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,980
platform is kind of a joke but it's like

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,640
suspense related components TS DX is

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,200
super useful

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,569
it's like create react app if you're

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,030
building a type script project and

00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,319
change casts and start our smaller

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,790
projects but the granddaddy of them all

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,980
is formic and as of January 1 I actually

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,730
took a step back from the Palmer group

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,739
work on formic full-time whoo talk about

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,769
that today

00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:39,330
so formic is the most popular library in

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:43,480
the world for building forms and react

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:45,069
and it solves an acute problem mostly

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,239
that form suck how many people here

00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,170
enjoy writing forms like no one right

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,049
how many people here in the audience

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,440
write a form every day like a day at

00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:59,410
work okay so like a couple of you about

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,120
once a week all right larger fortune

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,190
basically yeah so forms suck and there

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,400
are large part of our life they also are

00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,900
this interesting when you think about

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,390
what a form is it's actually like the

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:15,879
oldest notion of transferring like human

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,349
thought onto parchment or paper or stone

00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,579
like I actually tried to look this up

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:22,359
the other day is like what was the first

00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:25,060
form and it goes back to like ancient

00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,410
Egypt actually actually even earlier in

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,299
that perhaps in like Mesopotamia they're

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,950
not really sure but as soon as they

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:35,590
literally developed like writing to do

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,870
tax collection effectively and they had

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,609
the first tax form or just like little

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,549
grid right and that first entry point

00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:46,630
that like which was like made with a

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,859
keenya form like was dots in a grid and

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,010
that little first one that was the first

00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:54,220
input ever so but since then it sucked

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:59,260
right it's not gotten better pretty much

00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:00,669
like stagnated yeah form suck and forth

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,549
suck a lot in react to you by the way

00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:05,040
it's not it's not great so if you're not

00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,450
familiar with how to do a form and react

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,900
this is how you make a controlled input

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:16,209
in react you have some sort of change

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,530
handler and you pass a value of state

00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,870
and you've passed the change channel to

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,190
the input now you can control the input

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,330
in JavaScript and react which is great

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,620
because when you could keep something in

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,930
state you can reason about it very

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,770
easily when you have multiple inputs in

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,409
react you can get fancy and you can

00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,479
share a change handler between them and

00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:40,870
so this is how you would do that you've

00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:43,710
used maybe the HTML name attribute to

00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,260
and an es6 computed property to

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:52,960
determine which slice of state you

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:56,230
wanted to update so for suck and react

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,860
for a couple reasons it's not that they

00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,870
suck

00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:02,040
it's a react is really good at a lot of

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,020
things but forms just isn't one of them

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,330
you've got a lot to do you have to wire

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,250
up your state you have to deal with

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,960
validation right that's not done for you

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,120
what I just described to you is this

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,230
basically all of the react API for forms

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,040
they don't tell you how to validate they

00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,170
don't tell you how to deal with error

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,380
messages testing focus management

00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,520
staying organized none of it right and

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,590
that's awesome because it's liberating

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,320
but also if you're building a larger

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,370
application challenging so I was at the

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,730
agency as building this large

00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,140
administrative dashboard with insane

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:41,530
business logic like bananas and I knew

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,760
from day one that we need to make some

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,970
sort of abstraction to stay consistent

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,980
we had like 30 forms or so and we knew

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,050
that schema forms weren't gonna work for

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,900
us so what we did was we built this

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,560
thing called formic which was a

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:58,420
component that is logic only meaning it

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,310
only handles it doesn't handle rendering

00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,310
your inputs it just handles

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:09,100
the state basically and the functions

00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:11,230
and methods and helpers but it doesn't

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,580
actually do the rendering we've we

00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,380
weren't really sure about our component

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,420
library yet we just were like you know

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,800
what we need we need some things are

00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,140
gonna hold logic so let's just do that

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,300
so that was the goal and the other goal

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,870
of with formic was to build something

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:28,120
that would solve for 80% of use cases I

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,320
wasn't concerned about making it work on

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,000
every form just most of them I also

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,100
wanted to have the battery pack included

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,530
and what that means is you know when you

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,630
got games as a kid you know and the

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,760
games came with like a battery pack and

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,560
it was like with the with the game you

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,720
just played immediately or the toy right

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,280
that's awesome you didn't have to like

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,600
or didn't need a screwdriver to undo it

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,530
like that's it you just it should just

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,760
work out of the box it also needed to be

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,880
incrementally adoptable

00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,560
deletable and what that's super

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,960
important because I wasn't so sure about

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,720
formic at first and so I made it really

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,120
easy to delete the code if I really easy

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,340
delete and search for and find and it

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,950
sort of just made it forced meets so

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,840
that maybe my next forum is gonna be

00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,100
this new libraries building maybe the

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,140
one after that isn't because it might

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,290
suck but anyway that actually paid off

00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,910
in the long run and the other thing that

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,470
was important was that I didn't want to

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,000
use any magical stuff I didn't wanted to

00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,740
use observables I didn't want to use

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,590
Redux I didn't want to use mob X I just

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:34,350
wanted to use the framework we're gonna

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:37,630
come back to that so for Mike exploded

00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:40,990
since 2017 I think we just had our 27th

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,520
millionth download from NPM eight twenty

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:46,960
thousand github stars a couple days ago

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,420
so yeah meaningless metrics now I'm

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
getting this is the more important thing

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,400
is that who uses formic and sometimes

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,320
the largest brands in the world most

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,120
people if they have a phone there's a

00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,070
formic forum on one of the other apps

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,640
and react native or on the web that you

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:05,320
browse go through almost every day I've

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,030
tried to do like the total number of

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,250
people that enter a forum on earth of

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,260
power by formic and like I don't know

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:15,420
it's somewhere it's a lot it's a lot

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:17,940
it's like a lot of people that's cool

00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:22,660
forum still suck

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,930
so formic and any and all the other

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,610
react libraries that help you with forms

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,440
largely forms there aren't as hard as

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,970
they used to be but they are annoying

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,380
and repetitive and that's where what I'm

00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:40,660
gonna introduce today is going to come

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:43,390
in so in the age of automation it's

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,600
twenty twenty right the roaring 20s it's

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,640
time we automate some things and so what

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,430
I want to show you now is something I've

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:57,860
been working on for the last six months

00:08:50,430 --> 00:09:02,220
called formic cloud so

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:06,150
let's get to it so at formic calm we've

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,900
got the domain name you will is now the

00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:15,000
home of formic and the goal of the new

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:16,620
company is to make money which is a

00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,480
surprise it's an open-source project

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,660
right no

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,370
so formic ink will make money

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,770
I hope otherwise there's not gonna last

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:30,210
very long but so open-source isn't

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,370
sustainable I believe that while charity

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,990
is a great thing and patreon and

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,250
sponsorships are really great and I

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,400
think if they work for the people that

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,540
they work for that's awesome

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,390
personally I've been building software

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,520
my entire life for people to sell to

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,080
users or clients whatever like I feel

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,670
like you can use the internet to sell

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,570
software and people will pay for it so

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,940
that's what we're gonna do we're gonna

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,490
sell software so at the core of that

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,260
software is going to be the like formic

00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,910
itself but on top of that we're gonna

00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,820
layer on some new products and I want to

00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,270
show some of them off to you today

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,650
so yes the formic library is still there

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,830
but the first part of form a cloud that

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:11,280
is already available is formic cloud

00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:15,680
storage and let's have a look at it so

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,630
for our cloud storage is a single table

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,410
database that you can use to store

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,640
arbitrary form submissions so most of

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,930
all makes sense we'll do a code demo a

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:32,940
little bit but let's just take a look at

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:36,000
what this looks like so let's login so

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:40,800
this is the dashboard we're going to

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,020
switch to my personal account and you

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,270
can see I use this on my website Jarrod

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,350
Palmer calm for my subscription form at

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,780
the bottom which I'll show you in a

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,790
moment but basically in the dashboard I

00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,920
get this inbox like view if I want it of

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:56,490
all submissions and these are just

00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:01,920
emails it's just a simple name email

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:05,070
signup form more complex forms let's go

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,830
to our HQ for a second ready to zoom in

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,540
am i you zoom in we can see from like

00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:15,410
Klout feedback you can get this grid

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:19,120
view as well and you can view your

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,350
submissions and the way this works is

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,100
when you create a new forum which we'll

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:29,150
do in a second you get a endpoint and

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,420
this endpoint is literally as easy as

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,640
that

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,410
it's API to former comm and the name of

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,870
your submission and you can just send

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,430
and dump whatever data you want there so

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,380
you can send it by carrier pigeon you

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,750
can send it by HTTP sorry let's go back

00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,340
here you can send it through curl you

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,110
don't even need to use formic it's just

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,150
a raw endpoint for your forum data and

00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,920
the idea here is that sometimes you just

00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,330
have contact forms and you don't need to

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,890
have your you don't need to write a

00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:55,130
service function you just want to put it

00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,630
somewhere right so you can use react use

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,000
formic you can use like we can just make

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,350
use curl whatever you want and the

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,200
benefit this is you just drop this in

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,680
export to CSV and you can do whatever

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,680
you want with that

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,490
speaking of whatever you want with that

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,220
that's the second product that we're

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:16,100
going to be launching so in addition to

00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:21,620
submissions we're going to be launching

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:25,010
for MacLeod actions so cloud actions are

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,210
pre-built serverless functions that in a

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,190
in the future you'll be able to write

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,410
yourself but right now they're just some

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,110
pre baked ones you'll also be able to

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,610
send the data choose a peer so if you

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,250
want to leverage Napier how many people

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:39,530
here know what zapier is okay cool so

00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,810
zapier is an awesome framework sorry

00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:45,020
service that uses web hooks you could

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,000
set up conditions like if my if this

00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,220
person is updated in Salesforce update

00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,900
them in MailChimp so if there's a forum

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,370
at clouds a peer integration and so you

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,560
can get all of the data from form a

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:56,390
cloud on the zapier and automate away

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,460
we'll also be launching our own server

00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:02,450
lists sort of automation platform later

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,040
this year but regardless you can do

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,240
awesome stuff like side - thank you know

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,890
right that'd be a great thing to do with

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,710
a form so this is like with Thank You

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:16,400
Don my account so I can send my email

00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:18,260
address I can customize the email we

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,340
have a default template but I can also

00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,840
do something like

00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:27,300
no thank you and I can change this

00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,010
instead of emailing this to myself I can

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,160
be like use variables from the form

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,440
submission so I could be like use email

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,730
this is now gonna send an email to the

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,940
person that's submitted based on the

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:43,589
email field let's delete that like that

00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:47,779
and let's customize this default

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:56,240
template with raw text so it's a high

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:56,240
name thanks so much for reaching out

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:06,470
touch soon can't type

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:19,670
okay um it's so unnecessary

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,019
um so it's also great is that we'll give

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,199
you an email address by default but you

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,850
can also bring your own SMTP so you can

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,649
have these emails actually come from you

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,740
either through Gmail or Outlook or

00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:33,050
mailgun SendGrid whatever you want I'm

00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,990
just putting your SMTP SMTP credentials

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:39,110
and you'll have an email you can also do

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,600
slack web hooks let's go back as well

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,980
and this platform is built for

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,209
developers and one of the things we had

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,709
at the agency was we always want to know

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,410
exactly what we were sending to people

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,540
and so built like from day one from the

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,839
ground up are like very serious logs and

00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,820
so you could actually view former like

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,940
previous actions and see exactly what

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,290
was sent in case there's any errors you

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,959
can also see what it's been related to

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,970
and so this basically gives you as much

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,029
Glan granularity as possible when it

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:14,420
comes to debugging your format cloud

00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:17,630
actions so those are the first two

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,399
components of forming cloud and they're

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,899
great and they're available today and so

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,630
if you log on you can start using format

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:26,540
cloud today but what I really wanted to

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:32,899
show you guys is what's coming and that

00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:38,000
is formic cloud forms so I'm running

00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:40,760
this locally so yeah so let's login

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,079
locally so for my cloud forms is a form

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,060
builder that's you're probably familiar

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,699
with if you've used type form or

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,279
SurveyMonkey that's built on top of

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:51,980
format cloud but you don't need to use

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,209
it all of this again is incrementally

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,860
adoptable and incrementally deletable so

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:02,209
I'm running a local version of format

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,290
cloud right now and you can see there's

00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:05,120
the submissions that are already in a

00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:09,110
swarm but there's a new tab called

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,350
design which is going to explode of

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,350
course

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:25,570
wonderful there we go um forget that

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,670
happened whatever all right so you've

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,290
seen form builders before this one is

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,240
very similar to form builders you aren't

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,029
you built before but what is different

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,890
about it is the way you will put it into

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,880
your application so this is what it

00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,720
looks like it's form build we're going

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,490
to come back and play with this in a

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,720
second what I want to talk to you about

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:46,600
is how normal form builders work most

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,010
well what is going on with Excalibur oh

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:54,519
wow this is trippy though right okay

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:59,260
it's got a flood do this all right what

00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:01,209
in the what is going down I hope this is

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,890
gonna work all right anyways I just may

00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:05,919
have ruined this but let's go with it so

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,870
normal form builders let's use it right

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,780
normal form builders work like this they

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:13,209
have some website the UI they give you

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,069
like forms for builder comm and then you

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,780
send your user to some other person

00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,579
other website which is weird

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,350
like what's 20/20 why are you sending

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,179
your user to another domain name that's

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,000
 that's ridiculous

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:27,760
like on normal form builders it looks

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,110
nothing like your your brand you don't

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,190
get to use any of your own components

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,809
it's just this random thing so and then

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,309
what they forced you to do then is you

00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:37,660
have your app which is blue and their

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:39,520
form builder which is like I don't know

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,290
whatever color it is and you embed it in

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,140
an iframe and now all of you used

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,150
iframes recently but they suck and

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,040
Entering forms and iframes can be very

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,750
janky and weird for a whole host of it

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,640
reasons but this is how like the

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,350
traditional form systems work and the

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,900
reason for that is they're like super

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,880
crazy about all their proprietary form

00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,669
building stuff whatever

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:07,919
what formics gonna do see if we can

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:07,919
actually like not have this do this yes

00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:18,019
wonderful Oh whatever we get it we get

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,750
it what former's gonna do that's

00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:23,299
different is so by going directly

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,929
through the API and not through an

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:28,549
iframe we're going to let you in bring

00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,799
your own react components and that's

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:32,389
what I want to show off today so you'll

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,210
be able to use a form builder that

00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:37,159
you've probably familiar with and yes we

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,850
will make a form that's on form a hosted

00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,799
version of it

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,690
that'll be FEMA balai kube seen before

00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:42,649
but you haven't seen before it's how

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,070
you're gonna integrate it into your

00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:49,460
react app so that's what I want to show

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:52,220
off today so if we go back to our form

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:56,389
builder can we see get a little preview

00:18:52,220 --> 00:19:04,789
and you can select question types at

00:18:56,389 --> 00:19:06,620
will be like I don't know what's the

00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:15,980
weather look like I don't know it's a

00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:20,750
terrible question cold hot this makes

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,460
sense obviously and so you could see

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,009
live preview you can adjust things you

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,440
can drag and drop these as you'd expect

00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,490
and this is just gonna get better and

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,450
better and better we're gonna add

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,670
conditional logic

00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,210
there'll be payments there's gonna be

00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,539
[Music]

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,620
question banks recalling information

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:42,309
we'll just support quizzes as well as

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:45,440
[Music]

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:50,029
more like complex groups of questions

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,740
but doing this for like a month so give

00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:54,950
us time this will be out in about two

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,299
weeks so you can do that you can go to

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,429
add questions at will I think we've all

00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:01,519
seen form builders before yes

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,570
cool awesome we're gonna keep going so

00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,799
let's talk about how you get this into

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,220
your react app because it actually isn't

00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,220
gonna look like this thing on the right

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,220
so

00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:29,030
so this is how you're gonna actually

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:33,020
embed and pop up in this playground this

00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:37,640
is a just a starter this is a react app

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:38,240
that's running with parcel and what

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,539
you'll do

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,539
sorry I just oops and what you'll do

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:47,809
where's the next what you're gonna do

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,539
this is just a regular react app here

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:56,690
let's see this is running great know

00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:58,280
where that's coming in from there so

00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,630
this is a reactive parcel and what we're

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,559
gonna do now is I'm basically going to

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,809
show you how to embed a cloud form which

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,330
is a new API from on a cloud that's

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,980
going to allow you to add this kind of

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:16,970
form to your app and style it however

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:18,710
you want so let's do that right now so

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,510
the first step is going to be to

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:26,270
instantiate the form of cloud client so

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:30,950
the Yukons client equals cloud client

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:35,179
and this was called my project can you

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:37,190
all see okay great move this up here

00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:41,480
then going to have a form a cloud

00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:43,700
provider passing the client kind of like

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,220
a Palo I don't know if that's a good

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,980
thing but that's what it is that was

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:52,039
that was that was it mark okay anyways

00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:54,559
um so now we have some some context

00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:56,120
there and now normally what you do is

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,620
you'd be like I'm gonna write out all

00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,780
these fields right if I have this form

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,770
if you're gonna make this form and react

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:05,210
you beg for Mac and it'd be like the

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:09,679
website it would be like this

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:13,580
you go grab this you just steal this

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,760
right here thank you code sandbox you'd

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,470
be like that and you'd spend time typing

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,049
this out and you didn't port all this

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,840
stuff and you keep going and you'd waste

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:25,970
like an hour and a half doing this and

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,400
then there we have to style it up right

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:32,740
that's what you normally do but with

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,159
cloud forms you don't need to do that

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,159
cloud forms

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:57,680
you can just write beta invites and

00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,530
we'll import this it's missing some

00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,170
stuff and now you can see completely

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,530
unstyled in my application and we can

00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:12,190
pop this open and this is not an iframe

00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:18,440
it's just a regular gives the your form

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:25,040
and now we go back here whoops we go

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:28,340
back here we can edit it let's remove

00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:31,040
that question and let's go back to our

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,930
form for a second press refresh and

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,620
that's gone and what we're gonna have is

00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:39,530
a preview so be able to preview your own

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:41,180
like app inside of on former comm she

00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,150
won't have to do this tab switching we

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,620
have our form rendering which is great

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,330
but this doesn't look very awesome we I

00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,030
was just selling you all on like you can

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,270
make it look like your app all right

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,600
let's fix that so with the power of

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:59,170
cloud forms are that you can use any

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,000
format component that you already use

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,360
with format cloud and what does that

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:12,340
look like

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:12,340
so let's write a field for short text

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,070
and because I'm being lazy we'll do that

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:29,020
type script on stage so again we're just

00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:30,100
gonna use formics current API for things

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,570
and if you're not familiar with formic

00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,860
Forum it gives you some helpers to build

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:37,990
out and streamline your form process so

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,060
that includes helpers like use field

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,100
which gives you like on change and on

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,840
blur and the value depending on what you

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,590
pass to it so we're just going to use

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:53,590
the default field and meta from return

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:59,290
by use field and most pressing props now

00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:02,650
we're going to return we're using chakra

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:04,120
UI which is a cool UI library no no it's

00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,890
pretty good it's like kind of like tail

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,450
win but let's go figure out what we're

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,840
supposed to use this is the thing called

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,910
form control cool so they gave us like

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,540
this this thing let's use this we want

00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:24,040
to look like that

00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:25,570
imagine so copy so now we got to fix

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,310
this because the IDS aren't all gonna be

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:32,460
the same oops so assume that there's an

00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,460
ID

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:48,639
you know and you might as well do this

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:52,289
for the error message because we like

00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:52,289
being accessible and that's important

00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:05,009
and on I'm going to be lazy copy this

00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:05,009
out

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:17,450
and so that's just the helper text and

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:20,210
so and now let's do is invalid here cuz

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,420
that's part of this API they have some

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:25,700
props here is invalid boolean and we

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,250
know it's invalid based on this

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:32,570
condition and all I'm doing here it's

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:34,130
sort of boring but is I'm taking my own

00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,380
component library that I'd normally use

00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,550
in your app at work whatever you're

00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,710
doing and we're about to send it to

00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:43,610
format cloud so it can be used inside of

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,170
the render function great so we have

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,650
this thing and I could use short text

00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:51,680
than any regular format component I want

00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:56,660
but even better with for McLeod I can

00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:00,140
pass in an object with the default

00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:03,010
components and then for now my component

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,010
called short text

00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:16,110
and what did I mess up here how did I

00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,110
did something evil

00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:29,500
sweet wait there isn't something wrong

00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:31,410
oh no finish didn't finish that okay hey

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,090
there it is

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,370
so what we're showing off now is

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,680
basically you can embed your take your

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,540
own existing formic library then your

00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,920
group of like fields and send it to form

00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,340
a cloud and now what I've just given you

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,650
with format cloud is a builder so every

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:53,230
basically a type form for your own app

00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:58,930
so when I add a new field called call

00:27:53,230 --> 00:28:03,330
this company animal this is a short name

00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:03,330
of a company a band label there and

00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,600
sweet will do that

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,510
and now if I go back to my playground

00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:20,080
here that says email address because we

00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:21,910
didn't pass the label name company so

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,790
what this is gonna give everybody is

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,770
their own mini type form or SurveyMonkey

00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,910
for your own application and you the

00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:33,970
developer get to choose how this works

00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,950
we can also send this data wherever we

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,130
want to send it and by default it'll go

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,130
to form a cloud but you can send this to

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,210
your own you don't have to use form a

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:49,060
cloud if you don't want the cloud

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:55,870
storage if you don't want to so let's

00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:58,140
just sleep for 500 milliseconds and then

00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,140
what's

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:16,240
so after I do this type in Jared formic

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,389
and you can see it has a validation

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,700
already built in so it's just up just

00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:38,240
for us to style it so all the validation

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:40,190
is there it knows it's a URL and our

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:51,139
submit button isn't styled that sucks

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:54,919
let's fix that so now we have a submit

00:29:51,139 --> 00:30:09,110
button again so my name is Jared company

00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:14,000
formic GUP react oh I put your name

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:21,460
there Oh cuz I you know what I did ha

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,460
type email thank you again

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,520
just fun

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:55,320
ah it was this required that I pass

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:58,100
required sorry let's crush whatever

00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,100
figure it out

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:10,340
yeah do it again yeah oh I didn't spread

00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:12,650
field what ad one idiot thank you it's

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:17,620
like won't even code use your own

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:20,000
library idiot thank you

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:24,230
let's go back to what I was doing

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,890
aim good to fill out one more time I'm

00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,530
just kidding

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:32,659
I delete all this so just get this

00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:51,950
quickly name company website one last

00:31:32,659 --> 00:32:03,049
time boom and so now if we go to

00:31:51,950 --> 00:32:06,549
submissions of course if we go to

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:09,770
submissions you'll see Jared formic

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:13,760
company there in the submissions table

00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:16,100
and in our actions table that actually

00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,960
probably didn't send a message to my

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,510
slack but let's make it send a message

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,890
to my slack let's just make it send an

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:27,799
email like it send an email email

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,450
address to or you know what let's send

00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:37,820
it to slack we'll send a slack

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:44,720
so whatever hooks let's see now you know

00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:47,659
how to get to my slack so we'll create

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,260
that and if we went back to our page our

00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:58,130
playground and we press submit again

00:32:50,260 --> 00:33:02,120
great I pop open my slack okay Thank You

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:08,710
slack there it is 943 9:43 a.m. there it

00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:08,710
is boom ping get the slack and so that

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:18,830
is the gist of for MacLeod and so the

00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:20,809
idea here is let's just sort of back

00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:28,250
toward our demo I'm sorry our

00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:31,669
presentation oops and so the idea again

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:34,610
is that you'll be able to use your own

00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,140
components and back to our Excalibur

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,520
thing you or your own components at your

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,679
own app but you'll now have a form

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,240
builder that you've never liked probably

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,799
maybe you built it for yourself maybe

00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,720
you haven't but the idea here is that

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:51,110
most forms like it can be absolutely

00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,820
built with formic and ruffly I would say

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,730
twenty to thirty percent of those forms

00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:01,039
are pretty boilerplate right they're not

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:02,630
crazy logic they are this you're just

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,250
very standardized maybe there's a little

00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:06,649
bit of conditional logic but nothing

00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,700
wild and those forms can be built with

00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:13,909
formic formic clouds cloud forms and

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:16,280
again these shouldn't be native to your

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,379
application there's no reason 2020 to

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,970
send someone to type form or survey

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:21,830
monkey or anything like that and the

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,149
idea is that form a cloud will be the

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:26,830
platform where you can conduct surveys

00:34:23,149 --> 00:34:31,000
run quizzes in app questions as well as

00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:34,609
handle things like support forms or

00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,770
contests whatever you're thinking you'll

00:34:34,609 --> 00:34:40,040
be able to build that with form a cloud

00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:45,050
and best of all you the developer will

00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,940
able developer were able to empower even

00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,790
the some sort of non-technical people on

00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,349
your team to create forms in an

00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,909
efficient way that's very very that are

00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:55,220
very powerful and then sort of bridge

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:58,670
that gap between developers and the

00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,859
marketing team that now exists around

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:02,720
forms right they probably have some

00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:04,339
complicated marketing workflow and you

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,380
don't want to spend or waste another

00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:08,270
time on like some sort of support form

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,800
right so this is something that's going

00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:14,660
to glue these two sides of the house

00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:20,990
together and so just to summarize back

00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:22,560
to this cloud forms are coming in the

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:26,100
next two or three weeks

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,870
publicly as well as docks for all the

00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:31,410
stuff cloud storage is already available

00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,430
so you can use any sort of formic form

00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,260
in their docks for this as well at

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,470
formic calm and cloud actions are

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,030
available and we'll also be working on

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,000
new docks and new examples for regular

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:45,300
formic as well as formic cloud and then

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:52,370
going forward the idea is that formic is

00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:57,270
going to be the the forum platform from

00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:59,400
development to submission and storage to

00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:01,230
processing and then finally measurement

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,930
and so that's where we're gonna focus

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,660
our energy as a company is around these

00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:09,780
things development with the open source

00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:14,640
sdk which isn't going anywhere as well

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,860
as these new components like for McCloud

00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,090
forms there also will be some new

00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,390
analytics components that are will be

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,640
dropping later this year to form a cloud

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,810
storage and actions which will help you

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,120
process and manipulate your data and

00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,590
then finally form a cloud analytics

00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,690
which is something that's I haven't

00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,550
mentioned yet but that will be allowing

00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:38,100
you to have super granular fine-grained

00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,140
metrics around your form sessions and

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,730
the idea with analytics there is that

00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,470
you know you may have a runtime error

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:47,550
that something like sentry would catch

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,290
but if there's a black hole in the

00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,240
middle of your signup form that no one's

00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,590
getting past but it's not causing a

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,970
runtime error you'd have no way to

00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,520
understand that unless you were looking

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,890
for it so with for McCloud analytics the

00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,660
idea will be to help you identify those

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,820
kinds of opportunities and boost your

00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,170
conversion so those are like the four I

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,700
like the three but those are the four

00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:09,390
main things that a company be focusing

00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,370
on going forward and above all else like

00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,750
open source at the Attucks core I

00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,800
believe is important to our success and

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:20,190
you know I used to work at Goldman Sachs

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,050
and actually the the tert the the phrase

00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,350
that they used to tell us as interns was

00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:27,570
be long-term greedy which is a weird

00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,690
thing to say but being long-term greedy

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,190
is basically doing what doing good by

00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,540
doing well by your clients and customers

00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:38,540
and so the goal of formic ink

00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:41,150
is to empower you the developers to

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:44,060
build more epic like period under

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,350
discussion so when it comes to what's

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:47,390
open-source or what's not open-source

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,190
what's paid for what's not you know fair

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,050
pricing is important but also making

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,910
sure that you can just do your job

00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,710
better and move on with your day that's

00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,000
what we're here for and we'll figure out

00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:00,410
you know how we're gonna price it later

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,390
on based in a fair manner on the

00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,150
resources we use but at the end of the

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,620
day we believe that like by empowering

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,990
better developers in their day-to-day

00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,360
lives like we would we will do we will

00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,370
be successful and I hope you think so to

00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,320
you and I hope you find these tools you

00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,080
know as you get more used to them and

00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,560
play with them to be you know part of

00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:24,110
your toolset in your day to day life and

00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,600
yeah I hope they help you build more

00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,310
epic so anyways thank you for

00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,230
inviting me here I'll open this up to

00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,360
questions I'm sure maybe you have some

00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,520
of them but Thank You agent Compton

00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,740
Thank You Sara and thank you to all the

00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,340
sponsors this has been a form of cloud

00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:44,310
thank you

00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:50,530
[Applause]

00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:59,890
does anyone have any questions yeah yeah

00:38:50,530 --> 00:39:03,580
a couple hi thanks for your talk was

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:08,170
really interesting but what I can see

00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:13,860
this is only for really how could I say

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:16,810
it for easy forms we are not gonna see

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:20,140
something like I don't know a dependent

00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:21,220
select or so that's yeah so I didn't get

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,140
to show this off but actually to

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,330
interrupt you sorry there are there is

00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,230
conditional logic I just not I didn't

00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,370
show it off today but there's

00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:31,330
conditional logic you'll be able to be

00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:34,120
make very complex boolean logic

00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:36,850
statements such as if this value is

00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,880
equal to this then jump to this section

00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,080
this field or set this value and you'll

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,720
be able to control all of that within

00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,550
the Builder so be able to that's like

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,780
absolutely gonna be there from day one I

00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:50,560
just didn't have chance to show it off

00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,300
okay yeah no I'm more in sync it would

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,370
be absolutely useless if it didn't do

00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,110
that it would be like a contact form

00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,550
builder otherwise but I totally totally

00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,650
feel you there well as well as you'll be

00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,010
able to use the same logic to calculate

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:06,520
pricing as well as scores for quizzes

00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:07,930
okay yeah thank you we have time for one

00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,020
more question does anyone else have a

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,020
question

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:29,240
yeah thanks awesome idea and product

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,780
chart I love the idea of no code tools

00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,580
just one question

00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,460
how would it do our version controlling

00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:39,180
your forms yes so this is one of the

00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,560
interesting situations we are going to

00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,390
ask for feedback how people want to

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,680
version them there are sort of two

00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,640
trains of thought and it may be very

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,110
forum dependent the problem is you've

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,110
just probably thought of in your head is

00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:55,200
I will my form depends on something in

00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,060
my database and that may not be out into

00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,120
the public yet how do I test this how do

00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,330
i how do i simultaneously roll out

00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,620
changes to my cloud form with my new

00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:06,270
like version of my application that's

00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,190
really probably right yeah right so

00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,810
there's there's there some forms where

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,550
you actually don't care you actually

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,530
want marketing to be able to change this

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,990
on the fly there are other forms where

00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,720
you really want to lock it down and what

00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:22,170
we're likely going to do is allow you to

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,700
set up like a git hash and put in the in

00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:25,440
basically if you're familiar with sentry

00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,630
releases it's the same sort of concept

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,940
when you make the request with a new get

00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:32,400
hash it will like line that up to the

00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,080
next version of the form basically so

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,340
you'll be able to set up like okay make

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,460
a potentially new version store that and

00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:43,350
when the and like basically that will

00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:47,970
lay in wait as like a draft and then

00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:50,490
when a new get hash is sent or is in the

00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,870
request after the new code has been

00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,330
deployed you make some sort of

00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:57,780
environment variable like window dot

00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:59,910
release that would be sent to the API

00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,950
and then the newer version of the form

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,990
would be sent back if that makes sense

00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:06,360
still sort of issues around that but

00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:12,600

00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:13,510
