thank you Dorn burn thank you for having

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,100
me and thank you for yeah well I think

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:22,340
we know that I'm speaking today it's

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:25,680
just like few hours ago literally so

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:29,220
yeah I I would like to excuse me myself

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:34,160
because Vistal was supposed to be like a

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:39,030
lightning talk and I try to make it like

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,010
longer but I don't know if it's it's

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,899
still probably not the full-blown told

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,809
but I think because it's it's so

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,670
important to me I still wanted to do it

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,440
and talk about this thing and let me

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,420
introduce myself my name is Andre I'm

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,350
originally from Russia but I live in

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,120
Vienna for past almost 10 years I'm one

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,670
of the co-organizers of react Vienna so

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,189
if you in Vienna let us know and we

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,400
might organize event and you could speak

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:14,189
at it and we also having a reason conf

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:18,030
in my in May so you should check out the

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,640
website subscribe to newsletter because

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,930
we still done some tickets and come to

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:29,009
Vienna in May and yeah let's get back to

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:31,049
topic so water how is the in train and I

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,930
found this definition of link on

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,390
Wikipedia it says link or a linter is

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,100
any tool that Flags suspicious usage in

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,110
software written in so I made my own

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,670
definition like linter is a tool that

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,640
finds stupid bugs point and you know how

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,549
I feel if you feel the same then I

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,210
started working on any new project I you

00:01:53,549 --> 00:02:01,590
know I open up a project and this tiny

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,360
little things here is like and then I

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,820
look at source code I see this red thing

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,399
so basically but all I see is like it's

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,250
tonal visions like I see this thing it's

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:17,690
like it's like this

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:19,900
that's like and I'm like this okay like

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:23,360
let's fix it how do we fix it

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,290
do you know how to fix it right just

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,150
leaned all the things and we're at like

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,340
there are tons of winters out were so

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:35,630
like you can link your text think about

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,120
it text like natural language you can of

00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,260
course lean JavaScript and ECMO script

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:46,130
you can lint style sheet set CSS you can

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,140
lean chasin and you can lean basically

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:51,110
any style sheet with style and so even

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,400
styled components max max knows about it

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:58,970
he wrote it so why why should we do that

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,860
right why should we wind this is kind of

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,940
a definition that you could use to sell

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,550
it to your boss so on average software

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:10,280
developers spend 50 percent of our time

00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:13,100
finding and fixing bugs and where's the

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,769
research but proves that so it's I

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:20,450
didn't make it didn't make it up and

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:23,959
this inefficiency is estimated to cost

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:26,900
the global economy 312 billions per year

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,670
when I saw it I was like seriously it's

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,030
like seriously is literally burning

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:36,800
mining is like so if you don't think

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:39,140
you're doing this but in reality told

00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,120
everyone knows everyone who who is

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,040
developer probably will agree with me on

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
this one so I changed the definition

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,660
again a little bit so on average

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:52,910
software spend 50% on time discussing

00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:55,549
code style so and you know how it goes

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,610
is like two guys like I'm taps I'm

00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:03,140
spaces and the first guys and I'm like I

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:08,090
don't care and you know and he suffers

00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:10,250
like for a rest of his life yeah because

00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,810
Lee and he's probably like like I'm good

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,239
I'm doing a good thing because like you

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,359
know if you you don't need talking find

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,380
my code anyways like it's ugly

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:23,630
so why are you so mad at me

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,330
so yeah we know why we met to do nothing

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:32,930
right so how to fix it right so one

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:35,300
cod-style to rule them all but seriously

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,990
like where is this tool everybody knows

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,440
about right

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:41,120
who knows what pretty years okay

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,870
not everybody you should check it out

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:49,030
it's amazing it's it's it's like it's

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:52,330
like this but without this

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:58,430
so it basically it solves the problem so

00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:02,660
it linters plus four mattes can can lead

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,940
to fewer stupid bugs and they can lead

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,240
to better readability of your code which

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:12,770
in and in turn leads to less time in

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:17,150
code reviews good for business and the

00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:19,520
third thing that is kind of what I'm

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,120
worrying about is like but it still kind

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,220
of slows you down right on a way and and

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:31,490
at that moment your boss is like a slow

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:33,650
does not know linked know and to think

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:36,380
about it like let's think of a typical

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,710
developers day so it usually like my day

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,480
goes like this I write my code lots of

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,240
fun lots of lots of it

00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,870
and and then i'm done i'm and i'm

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,220
creating a pull request and i'm you know

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,620
i go for coffee or whatever because i'm

00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,690
done right i I submitted the pull

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,360
request and I could get back I check my

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:02,690
email and I and I go to get up and it's

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,450
like damn it's like some chicks were not

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,510
successful continuous integration failed

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:11,840
and I'm like oh probably broke the whole

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,150
thing and then I go to Travis she is

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,070
like oh yeah it's missing semicolon

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:21,670
right and it's like so yeah so you go

00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,230
back to editor and you fix it

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:28,370
it's lots of keystrokes but you fix it

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:31,580
you push it it's green it's all good but

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:35,750
still your kind of thing why must life

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,250
be so hard right and it's like yeah

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,990
raise your hand

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,700
who knows what I'm talking about how

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,790
many of you yeah it's pretty much

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,070
everyone which is cool yeah and I was

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,920
like how many people out were suffering

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:52,640
from that and I went to this pretty much

00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,840
known project it's called epic and I

00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,240
checked it it's like one day of commits

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,590
it's like fixing impatient and like fix

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:07,040
linting fix a PS lanisha's fix Li I

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:11,540
didn't even start scrolling it goes like

00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:16,430
that for you know many many pixels so I

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:25,700
searched for it I searched on github so

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:27,290
yeah 500,000 fixing linter I didn't even

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,330
try different variations it's just like

00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:33,710
this number okay remember this number

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:39,080
and I was like fix indentation that's

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:44,060
like almost three million I wish I could

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:50,120
lean before I commit somehow and yeah

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:52,250
you can do this with get hooks but I

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,400
mean even like seriously smart guys

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,820
don't know how to setup get hooks

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,060
because get hooks are really hard to set

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,650
up really hard to manage and this is

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,750
really important really hard to share a

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,090
cross with team because even even if you

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,280
completed first two steps you're still

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,340
kind of the whole team is missing in and

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,500
I've been where and it's it's it's it's

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,140
bad so because you have only one on a

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,680
team who leans and everyone is like

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,090
thank you and you don't want this so you

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,750
like the whole team needs to be

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,540
committed so how to fix this so this

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,060
particular issue can be fixed as easy as

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,390
installing husky which is a nice small

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:39,380
package it just kind of solves the

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,940
problem of managing get hooks so all you

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,660
need to do is to add to your package

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:47,060
JSON this scripts think like pre commit

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,060
and say what command do you want to run

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,779
on pre-commit hook in this case and

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,110
imagine you

00:08:50,779 --> 00:09:00,860
that and you start committing and you

00:08:54,110 --> 00:09:05,319
press ENTER and it's like and ten

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:09,019
minutes later it's like six thousand so

00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:10,519
many many errors pops up saying like the

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,180
whole project is basically broken you

00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:15,439
need to throw it away and rewrite and

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,790
it's cool because like husky kind of

00:09:15,439 --> 00:09:21,439
solves some issues but we're still kind

00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,749
of if you try to link the whole project

00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:25,459
every time and pre-commit hook it's it

00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:28,100
is slow so if your project isn't like

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,499
your home page it will be slow and it

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,819
will display irrelevant results so it

00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:34,339
basically will link the whole thing

00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:38,149
again and again that thing kept me

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:42,110
thinking how like Kim can it be solved

00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:46,309
somehow in a way it's like I don't feel

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,470
bad about it every time I do it and I

00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:50,629
was like what if we could run interest

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,449
only on files we are about to commit

00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,790
right and this is where you meet lint

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:59,000
staged it's the project I created and I

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:01,339
maintain and the only goal of this

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,339
project is you can see from the logotype

00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:07,610
is like don't let you put bad things

00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:09,379
into repository and to install it it's

00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,389
it's it's kind of the same it's like you

00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:14,779
need the husky and Bennion installed in

00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:16,759
staged and the only thing you need to

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,860
change is like instead of saying can

00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,290
pretty mint lint es lint you sail in

00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:25,100
stage and you add this config for an in

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:28,579
stage that basically says use es lean

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:33,559
for JavaScript files and this is how it

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,420
looks like so here we have for changed

00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,160
files but only file is going to be

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:41,559
committed and I'm missing a semicolon

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,559
here as you can see on purpose of course

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,050
so the next thing is happening it runs

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,959
and you can see the errors on the

00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,540
display for this single file so we're a

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,759
for errors tool and this is the next

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,100
problem I'm trying to solve which I will

00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,589
talk in a minute but but the most

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:04,300
important thing is it didn't even try to

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:07,880
lean files you didn't want to commit yet

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:11,690
so it brings us to get hooks are

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,770
actually pretty much good if you know

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:19,970
how to cook them and there is something

00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:23,780
more because you in lint stage but you

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,610
can actually do much much more and you

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,480
for example you can automatically fix

00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,040
lint errors and to do that the only

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,380
change you need is like instead of just

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,470
running yes me and you run eastland fix

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,950
obviously and then you get at files back

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,350
to your index or you can reformat your

00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:45,260
code with any any any tool I prefer

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,210
prettier it's kind of a standard for a

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,000
comma script but if you using like I

00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:54,590
don't know other languages you still can

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,790
use lint staged if you have not

00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,490
installed in your machine so you can

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,220
yeah so in this case like for prettier

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,190
it's like pretty right and get add for

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,200
all javascript files you can really

00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:12,320
actually use pretty root CSS Chasen

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,300
markdown and for like lots of PRS coming

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,730
to support it like I don't know grow of

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,170
Quayle stuff and much more more syntaxes

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,900
so it's gonna be even better in future

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:26,990
and this is how it looks now

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:30,370
so imagine someone wants to commit this

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:37,280
kind of react code nobody wants to read

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:40,340
he doesn't commit and the thing that

00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,100
actually committed it was that so the

00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,560
whole point is like it just goes out of

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:49,160
your way so this is what the whole idea

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,600
of the whole package just to let you do

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,240
your work

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,310
yeah when I submitted this pull request

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,000
to create reactive then I wrote was like

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:02,330
I tried it and I was like which is cool

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,200
I like the reaction and babble actually

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:08,870
also using pre tear and visit the help

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,990
of easily lint staged on a whole code

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,390
base which is also kind of a good proof

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:17,360
for the whole project for me so it kind

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,600
of tested on scale

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,850
and you might ask how does it like how

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,950
does it work right so in a beginning

00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,850
like the initial version was pretty much

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:34,820
this

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:38,840
so I created a batch file that literally

00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:42,740
just run this stage file thing and he is

00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:46,280
leaned on them and used these extensions

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,000
but it didn't scale so I started so I

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,300
pushed it

00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,300
I pushed the code on github and suddenly

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,520
people started committing sending me

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,410
pull requests this adding like styling

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,080
support and whatever and always pull

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,290
requests they looked like this so this

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,990
is styling and then was flow and so

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:10,640
basically all that like all changed is

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:15,050
these things so it wasn't really dry so

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:20,930
this project kind of became like a much

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:24,290
bigger thing from from that point so the

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:27,470
instance now is solving problems like it

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,070
can run any any at any task beat NPM

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:34,640
tasks or just any regular welcome and

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:36,920
it's easy to install the NPM or yarn so

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,750
it's it's in NPM

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,030
it's easy just to distribute across

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,830
routine this is the whole purpose of it

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:45,500
so it's basically one lint stage for C

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:49,190
file or part of package chasin which is

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,740
if you change it everyone gets next pull

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,030
and it's easy it's really easy to use

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,570
because developer experience is

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,550
something I really care about and that

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,300
brings me to kind of a future with a

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:05,570
question mark because where is this one

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,839
long-standing issue I'm kind of fighting

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,900
this for more than a year now so it's it

00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,830
was opened on 6th of October funnily

00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,780
enough in its originated from Mark

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,600
Stover's

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:23,570
react boilerplate originally so it's

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,010
kind of all connected this is the cool

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:29,150
thing about his project because many

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,800
many people are using it and they came

00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,740
up to this like they've been

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,870
is corrected but because I kind of I I

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:46,250
wasn't aware of it at the moment and

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:51,170
this issue kind of took a while to you

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:55,790
know to make even the screenshot so lots

00:15:51,170 --> 00:16:00,339
of discussion happened and lots of ideas

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:04,610
were proposed that I tried for this

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:08,390
almost year in half and today I actually

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:12,610
wanted to introduce something cool and

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:17,750
basically close vision and I work part

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:20,470
for past couple of days to do this but

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:23,810
unfortunately I still need to reopen it

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,630
yeah I I couldn't solve it but the idea

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:29,240
behind it was simple it should be have

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:33,200
been working like like magic you know

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:39,649
and I have even a screen video from

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:41,420
today where I so this partially staged

00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,370
problem is like when you have this hunk

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,950
so you want like I want to commit on the

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,579
first thing but I don't want linters to

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,950
yell at me for the second part and so

00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:56,270
now I just pick the Hanks eye I want to

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:58,870
commit so the whole idea is like ignore

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,459
everything that I don't want to commit

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:07,400
during the hook and now I will be

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:11,569
checking it in also committing in so it

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,490
kind of works so it only if you if you

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:17,720
see it only picked up this change so

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:20,990
this is the only if I have as expected

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:26,270
but we're still some some problems when

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,179
I try to restore the state so and always

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:32,390
like ideas I have tried coming from open

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:36,860
source which I have a huge gratitude to

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:38,929
be part of and I'm kind of like today

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,850
I'm kind of looking for help because I

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,770
kind of stuck with this issue and I

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,100
really want

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:51,370
like I really wanted to be solved and

00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:53,900
yeah so if like if you think you are

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,059
proficient with git and you know how

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,790
like all this low-level commands work

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,429
please come to me and talk to me are or

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,580
go to this repo and like command and

00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:06,650
help me solve this issue and I really

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,660
want to do a quick shout out to my

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:14,480
maintainer z-- so the project get to to

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,750
maintain errs now but help me resolving

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,730
issue so this is also kind of cold for

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:23,030
action so if you feel like you want to

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,860
start contributing it's probably a good

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,210
project to start because sometimes we

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,460
just have issues that needs to be

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:34,610
answered or some documentation update so

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,410
yeah if you want to be part of this jump

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:41,179
in and I will add it to the repository

00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:45,470
and to recap I want to finish my talk by

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:49,790
saying that forget this because

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:53,020
this is not important and I kind of

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:56,120
asked you to focus on real problems on

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,310
stuff that matters and I want to thank

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:08,500
you for your attention

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:08,500
[Applause]
