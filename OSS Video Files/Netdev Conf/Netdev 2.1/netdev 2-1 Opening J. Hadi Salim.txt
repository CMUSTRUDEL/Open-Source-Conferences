please try to show up a little bit

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,600
earlier than usual because our schedule

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:23,010

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:53,010
unfortunately we can't afford the hotel

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,079
so we'll have some guides not sure where

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,640
we're going today but every every day at

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,520
lunchtime right after the last talk

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,039
before lunch you walk outside there with

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,490
people taking you to some undisclosed

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:10,650
location at this point to have lunch and

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,330
we're also planning evening events this

00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,909
is an open source conference run by

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,560
volunteers so we're still undecided

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,970
where we're going tonight we were going

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,470
to we knew where we're going but it's

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,729
apparently going to rain like crazy

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:29,970
tonight so we can go outdoors so that is

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:31,890
also still in progress and without much

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,079
further ado I think we'll we don't do a

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,400
lot of talking we show stuff so I'm

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,400
