Title: Netdev 2.1 XDP for the Rest of Us By Andy Gospodarek + Jesper Dangaard Brouer
Publication date: 2017-06-03
Playlist: Netdev 2.1
Description: 
	XDP is an alternative approach to DPDK that runs within the Linux Kernel.
Learning to use XDP can feel like a fairly steep learning curve. Andy Gospodarek and Jesper Dangaard Brouer  try to flatten that learning curve in this introductory tutorial. The tutorial given on  2017/April  the 7th at Netdev 2.1 in Montreal is intended to provide clarity to kernel developers, sysadmins, or anyone with DevOps responsibilities.
