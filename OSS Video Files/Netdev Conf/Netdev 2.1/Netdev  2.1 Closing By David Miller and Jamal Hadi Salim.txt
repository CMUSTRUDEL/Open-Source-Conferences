00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,989
the success of this event so we'd like

them a round of applause a lot of people

00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,239
kind of snuff a little bit when they see

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,680
that we require a paper but I think that

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,230
adds to the quality at the conference

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,459

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,590
appreciate everyone for going through

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,450
the process and giving us all this stuff

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:28,640

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,960
impressive the amount of people that we

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,190
have now in the spectrum of individuals

00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,440
that show up at the conference it's

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,020
people that we all know and work with

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,590
already or local people now which is

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,790
happening more and more and it's really

00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,740
impressive you can see all the stats

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,410
there on the slide it's really say one

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,750
thing again you know proud of Canada

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,650
this is the first time in etive that we

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,660
had more than 25% local representation

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:58,220
Montreal overwhelmed the other cities

00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:02,020
auto second I think thank you it's just

00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,020
another reason why Montreal is awesome

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:13,910
yeah that so can I say something

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,410
this is the people who actually

00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,820
registered we know some of you didn't

00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:24,710
register and yes we collect this and as

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:27,370
far as we can see the native population

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,110
has gained a little bit of way to be

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,389
from I'm comparing against negative zero

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,530
one which we have stats on didn't you

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,300
have this in Ottawa do you have this

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,650
plan yeah I have I wish I'd put it up

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,139
there as a comparison so you've gained

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,700
weight a little bit but wait isn't it

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:44,030
because we have more Montreal errs

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,010
attending you mean all those hubs funds

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,229
they're eating as a protein or that yeah

00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:55,580
we all have their hubs funds that's why

00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:58,099
okay okay okay okay okay next I'll let

00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,900

basically interacted with them and

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,960
decided that instead of going to another
