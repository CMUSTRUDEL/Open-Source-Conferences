Title: netdev2-1: Playing BBR with a userspace network stack By Hajime Tazaki
Publication date: 2017-05-16
Playlist: Netdev 2.1
Description: 
	In this talk given at Netdev 2.1 in Montreal on April 7th 2017, Hajime Tazaki looks at some of the obstacles in moving the linux network stack to user space via the LKL infrastructure.

The talk focuses on timing accuracy concerns of a userspace network stack. Hajime presents the result of netperf benchmarks on select Linux TCP congestion control algorithms: BBR and cubic.
He compares both the LKL-ed netperf and ordinal netperf with Linux kernel and discusses what obstacle exist within LKL and what can be fixed to reach x1 performance of the barebone kernel network stack.
