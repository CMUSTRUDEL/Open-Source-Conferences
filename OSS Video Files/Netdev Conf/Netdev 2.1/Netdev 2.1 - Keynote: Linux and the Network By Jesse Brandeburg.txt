when I started out I was a contract

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,210
worker in validation and Jessie was the

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,210
driver developer so it was my regular

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,769
pleasure to say nope I can come up with

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,170
a test that breaks us I'm sure of it and

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,750
so my introduction to Simon his code I

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,670
think was what a 1000 I think back in

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,650
the day do you remember that card I held

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,090
up he's one of the guys that actually

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,880
was working on drivers for that stuff

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,380
way back when and so I think my first

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,080
real time doing any of that kind stuff

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,539
was I think you introduced the first

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,759
page based received really for a 1000

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,280
come to think of it so yeah so version

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,380
probably 0.1 would have been a 1000 code

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,770
written by Jesse pilot page based

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,780
receive stuff back in the day so sure I

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,059
think what else is there to say

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,410
he likes race cars you want to ask him

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,649
about any race car stuff I'm sure you

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,399
can get him talking for a while and

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:59,070
that's pretty much all I've got to say

00:00:50,399 --> 00:01:02,609
so take it away Jesse thanks Alex hi is

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,570
this thing working now okay so let me

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,570
get my slides up here

00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:14,650
I guess I don't need to introduce myself

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,310
now um I've been working for Intel for a

00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,660
long time

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,450
hello everyone I want to thank the

00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,160
organizers Jamal especially I know this

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,350
doing a show like this is a ton of work

00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,900
and I really appreciate them doing this

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,760
and giving us the opportunity to talk to

00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,040
each other and also for me to give you

00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:34,200
guys a chance to see my presentation and

00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,820
to talk to you so let's get started

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,400
network infrastructure right we all know

00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,840
this but you can't see it but really you

00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,850
can't live without it how many people of

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,619
you how many of you have a phone in your

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,950
pocket today right

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,390
pretty much everyone I hope you know

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,710
it's connected to the network

00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,479
it wouldn't work without all the network

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,830
infrastructure right we work on that

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,930
it's important Linux is making most of

00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,580
that infrastructure hum today there's a

00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,220
few places where Linux isn't but not

00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:05,920
many so but most of the time and we

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,840
think we need to help advertise this to

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,369
the community most of the time the users

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,869
don't realize they're using Linux we can

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,160
tell them hey we work on this stuff that

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:21,220
makes your guys's phone work so look in

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,480
a looking at the back at our network

00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,570
right where have we been

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,269
so Linux started back a long time ago

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:33,340
back in 1994 ish with the 1.0 release

00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:36,430
back then there was a 10 network drivers

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:40,360
they were maybe 250 to 1300 lines each

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,370
for about 10,000 lines of code so where

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,540
are we going right this is a this is

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,980
this chart was actually pretty

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,390
interesting once I built it I didn't

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,500
know it was going to be there until I

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,120
saw it

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,100
we were the the back line is the light

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,170
blue is the drivers net directory and

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,450
the lines of code as measured by slot

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,450
count and then the front line is the the

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,360
net directory so you can see the drivers

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,760
net directories growing pretty fast the

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:10,150
net core is the core code is also

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,220
growing but the drivers net directory is

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,380
growing a lot faster and this is pretty

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,250
much equally split by both wireless and

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,780
Ethernet drivers so you know they fight

00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,150
over who has the most lines of code and

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,030
the driver

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,260
net directory all the time we'll we may

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,540
want to try and think about what's

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,129
happened here and then what we want to

00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,659
do to help mitigate this because I'm not

00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:31,400
sure that you know the growth chart if

00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,439
it's going at this rate we're going to

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,609
be at 3 million lines of code in drivers

00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:41,269
net in a couple years how much code does

00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:44,150
Dave want to maintain I'm not sure so

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,890
another good point here is in 2009

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,530
roughly is where a virtualization was

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:52,909
introduced the first virtual driver ID

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,500
bvf from Intel and you know maybe we can

00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:57,980
slow things down a little bit by making

00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,799
more code common you guys remember back

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,269
in 1.0 we were all using modems and

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,129
maybe you had Ethernet at work if you

00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,569
were lucky and maybe it was plugged in

00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:09,859
over a BNC connector twisted pair a UI

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:12,069
some people here may not even have been

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,629
born yet it's disturbing

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:17,870
so Intel's been around for a while

00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:20,289
working on the network Intel's been

00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,720
around Ethernet since the very beginning

00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:27,020
you know this is just a little bit of a

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,210
brief history but I'm not going to go

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,470
into a whole lot of detail here this is

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:36,280
kind of more for the recording so what's

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,370
happening today the data growth is

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:43,190
massive that's coming from 2006 to 2015

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,530
the compound annual growth rate was 78%

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,539
of network traffic right so the network

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:52,849
traffic is increasing like crazy from in

00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:56,510
2010 to 2023 it's going to go by by a

00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:58,280
thousand times so there's a lot of

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:01,039
networking work to be done

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,599
we I'm not even sure that though we

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,949
understand in the network community how

00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,389
much data we're going to be carrying

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,270
over the Linux kernel and having to

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,979
process a lot of this becomes important

00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,960
to us because we have to start figuring

00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,789
out all the different what does this

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,909
mean to the network and what does this

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:22,039
mean to the kernel so with that in mind

00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:24,440
we'll go to you know everything is on

00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,990
the network right all these devices are

00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,690
coming all these computers all these

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,789
phones everything's going to be on the

00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,380
network so you know everything's on the

00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:38,740
network and then

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:40,780
work runs on Linux really from the

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,150
device to the data center so this is

00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,290
just a summary slide about what's going

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:50,220
on in the network today we have you know

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:53,410
all these devices connecting from

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,600
wireless to wired and going through all

00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:59,140
this infrastructure and then into the

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,070
data center in this picture Linux is all

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,080
over the place

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,090
right you can think Linux is obviously

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,420
here well but Linux has been moving into

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,180
this area quite a bit and Linux is even

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,980
moving in out into the edge what's

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,720
happening is is high speed networking is

00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,370
also going to be moving from this

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,870
direction right it's going to be moving

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,240
from the data center out towards the

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,360
devices as device networking gets faster

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,010
and faster for for instance 5.d like tom

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,140
was talking about earlier in his IOT

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,730
presentation right we're gonna need

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,770
these fast connections to provide all

00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:32,050
the services that people want and the

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,700
companies want to deliver one of which

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:40,930
is mine you know we we want to deliver

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:44,430
wired and wireless and you know as Linux

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:49,990
moves in this network Linux moves from

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:51,850
right to left the doing things like

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,040
having bbr deployed or some other

00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,750
machine learned congestion control

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,610
algorithm get a lot easier right

00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,230
especially if the ecosystem is is more

00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,120
uniform so there's actually some

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,220
advantages for us being part of that

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,890
ecosystem that's being spread across all

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,200
the devices you know from Android all

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:15,760
the way to little tiny IOT devices a lot

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:17,860
of stuff is running Linux today so say

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:22,780
it again everything's on the network and

00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:25,780
the network runs on Linux there is 50

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,800
billion devices are going to be

00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,540
connected to the Internet this is

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,550
unfathomable right all these devices are

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,310
going to be generating data they might

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,050
be connected via your phone they might

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,690
be connected themselves via wireless

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:44,710
they might have a wire if they're in a

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,120
factory they might be your car so more

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,699
and more devices and things

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,710
are coming it's gonna really change our

00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:52,900
world quite a bit the thing that's

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,860
common among all these is the network

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,650
right

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,930
we are the providers of the network in a

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,610
lot of cases and all these devices are

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,710
going to be talking to someone or

00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:09,370
something and the network's going to be

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:14,650
providing that the network is critical

00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:16,630
to our new economy right this is a bit

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,030
of give you in a bit of an idea about

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,280
how much data is going to be generated

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:26,050
by all these connected devices it's

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,639
crazy the it's really a flood you know

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,500
you're talking about autonomous driving

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,940
cars generating up to a gigabyte a

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:39,310
second the maybe a smart hospital might

00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:41,260
be generating 4 terabytes a day so and

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,350
connected factories might be generating

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:47,440
a million terabytes a day these all this

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,779
data may not be consumed or stored but

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,080
all these things these connected devices

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,220
are going across the network making

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,350
their way into data centers or into

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,480
centralized storage so storage is a big

00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,000
deal making their way across the network

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:10,980
with meeting all the needs of all these

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,980
devices is a huge huge concern

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:20,089
everything's on the network the network

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,290
runs on Linux don't forget that so

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:27,060
what's gonna happen with the Internet of

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:28,589
Things there's everything in the

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,720
network's gonna grow right we're gonna

00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,630
have to scale up it's gonna be a big

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,080
deal for both us as providers of network

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:40,260
gear and computer systems and all the

00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,529
parts in between the through a lot of

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,500
other companies here doing software or

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:50,850
us doing software the the network is

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:53,100
gonna use much more bandwidth have a lot

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,899
of concern and a lot of importance in

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,420
the technology as we go forward

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:02,730
it just has to grow the the scale and

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,870
scope is growing exponentially so this

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:10,170
guy looks like he's having a great time

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:12,060
doesn't he the all these devices like VR

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,520
or all these technologies are going to

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,680
be using more bandwidth right we're

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,300
we've increased our scale and scope it's

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,260
going to be using more bandwidth it's

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:24,089
gonna require a bigger network all these

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,560
things are dependent upon the network

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,360
and they're enabled by the network so

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,670
even though you might have a big data

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,000
center providing all the VR experiences

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,279
or even steering all the people so that

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,050
are in this big multiple person world

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,820
they will they will be cloud connected

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,830
they'll be using lots of bandwidth and

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,830
they'll be dependent upon the network

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,630
like Tom said in his presentation and

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,270
some of the other IOT presentations

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:58,980
today ultra-low latency is super

00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:00,720
important especially to vehicles but you

00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,700
know we're also talking about other

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,760
devices and other experiences that are

00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,350
going to need a lot of low latency the

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,850
network is going to help have to provide

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,399
that we're gonna have to satisfy these

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:17,730
new demands being put upon us both in

00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:19,800
hardware and in software especially 5g

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,100
is going to push lower latency and

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,750
vehicle to vehicle communication or

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,320
device the device communication is going

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,320
to be a big deal

00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,660
all these Internet of Things thingies

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,600
need security - Tom talked about a

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,310
little bit we think about it a lot what

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,570
is security mean in the design of

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:45,240
communication right and and it's got to

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,010
be secure these devices have to be able

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,880
to be designed from the ground up to be

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,310
secure we as a Linux ecosystem or Linux

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,750
providers need to be providing

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,790
easy-to-use solutions not just

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,130
technology but easy-to-use solutions

00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,020
that people will want to use because

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,180
they're right there and they're open

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:05,190
source and they're easy to use if

00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,020
there's something that's easier to use

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,310
some companies might pick it up and we

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,780
end up with this kind of fractured

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,630
ecosystem like it's been happening with

00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,960
the IOT devices today where you have

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:17,910
devices full of security holes using old

00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,260
technology because it was the first

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:22,950
thing that somebody found when they

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,170
googled for web server right they pick

00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,700
up a web server from 2006 that has just

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,480
full of zero-day holes that are already

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,340
known this may have been relevant to the

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,450
camera exploits that were recently in

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,640
the news here not too long ago another

00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,070
point about this is that the Linux

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,720
kernel network stack is the best place

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,610
to do truly commute secure

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,290
communications right doing it in

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,530
userspace apps is not the greatest way

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:51,750
to do it because and I firmly believe

00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:56,400
this the kernel is providing this layer

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:59,100
of both robust security and tested

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,200
security and it's tested over and over

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,640
again by being in every layer of that

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,260
previous slide that we saw from small

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,920
devices through infrastructure and out

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,920
to the data center

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,139
another thing is that hardware offload

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,839
for security is really important

00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,920
sometimes the big computers can help you

00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,449
out and do it fast

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,829
other times you're going to have a tiny

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:27,610
computer and it's not going to be really

00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,839
capable of providing security this

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,089
hardware offload in these small devices

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,230
is a big deal and I think it's gonna be

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:43,970
really important going forward it's no

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:45,350
longer an option it's required so once

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,269
you've got all these things you've got

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,980
ultra-low latency huge amounts of

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:50,720
traffic all coming in the data center

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,000
what are you gonna do with all this data

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,149
right it's going to be stored probably

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,589
that's a big deal but it's also got to

00:13:56,149 --> 00:13:59,149
be processed there's got to be some

00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,250
usefulness of all this otherwise why are

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:03,589
we gathering all of it right ai is the

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,649
thing that's going to be causing or

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:08,600
helping us understand or finding meaning

00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:10,940
in a lot of this data sometimes ai comes

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,480
up with really funny meanings among data

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,130
or things that you don't expect there's

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,920
a lot more data there then we can really

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,370
comprehend as people the computers don't

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,860
have too much trouble understanding it

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,829
but AI is the only way to make sense so

00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,709
but remember the network is the path to

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:33,079
the storage the network is the path to

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,910
the data center and the network is the

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,620
way that the AI uses to communicate

00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,620
between all of the different end points

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,750
and out to the devices Tom's devices

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:46,940
that he was talking about earlier in an

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:48,649
intersection might be might be having AI

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,970
in them but I think a lot of the

00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:51,350
learning that those devices are going to

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,740
be capitalizing on is going to be done

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,269
in data centers and over the network

00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:01,130
really the AI is dependent upon the

00:14:56,269 --> 00:15:03,290
network so just this is an example

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,569
here's an example of putting it all

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,420
together right from end to end the

00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:12,079
autonomous driving is a really hot topic

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,779
today and all the bits come together

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,850
here right we have the the cloud the

00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,970
core network in the access and then out

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,510
to the wireless technology going out to

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,649
the devices how many parts here in this

00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,510
picture do you think we'll be running

00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,730
Linux

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:32,050
probably a lot of them the network is

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,980
they're all over the place being used

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,170
many companies that they'll believe

00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,920
believe that today that will be having

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:42,170
autonomous driving by cars at least

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,779
level four and probably level five by

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,730
2020 or 20 21 this seems pretty

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,920
optimistic to me but we'll see what

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,450
happens I mean they keep on surprising

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,300
us going out and driving around cars by

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,370
themselves right so the the the thing is

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,709
is that we as network providers need to

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,580
be providing the solutions that will

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:03,430
help these things succeed and by we I

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,700
mean the Linux community not just Intel

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:10,820
and even as soon as 2018 will have cars

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:13,190
coming that will be driving themselves

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,740
and you've seen it today already in the

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:18,080
news right

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:24,500
so remember everything's on the network

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:26,390
and the network runs on Linux so also

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,160
remember when your car is driving around

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,010
down the road that it's probably talking

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,959
over lots of Linux machines and using a

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,700
technology that was at least started in

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,480
Linux if not using it all the time at

00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:42,020
the moment you're using it so what's in

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:48,020
store for us next maybe even you can

00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:50,570
call it Intel next so switch devs is the

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,130
way that we're moving forward on with

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,910
our products that have anything to do

00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:58,810
with switch so we're going to be

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,680
actively developing in that space

00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,149
especially things that have

00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,839
virtualization support we're going to be

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:10,520
using switch dev to help both connect

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,949
that to the host and configure it as of

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,510
you know as of today we believe that

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,439
switch dev is the right path for us and

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,959
we're going to be contributing the

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,550
community and you know the contributions

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:20,959
have already started out on the on the

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,220
list you may have seen some of the stuff

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,220
around i-40 coming out

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:37,350
so as far as the future goes the speed

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:39,820
march continues 100 200 400 gigs

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:41,110
there's even rumblings about terabit

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,090
Ethernet I don't know what that's gonna

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:47,260
mean to a server or a cluster of

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:50,440
machines but it's gonna be a big pipe we

00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,169
have new drivers coming soon hopefully

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,270
we'll be able to get them up streamed

00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:59,080
we're very interested in doing more

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:01,510
connections of TC using TC to add

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,000
Hardware filters it's a it's a big day

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,700
for a big deal for us and we are trying

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,440
to figure out what parts of the connect

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,210
and what parts of TC is missing so that

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,190
we can extend it to make sure that it

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,600
works right for our users and and for

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:19,450
the community we're also looking towards

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,919
dead link and trying to figure out what

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,059
a complete switch that Vacco system

00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:27,039
looks like so that we can actually

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:28,570
deploy it on our hardware we have lots

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,890
of things we can't talk about yet we

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:37,570
look forward to our close collaboration

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:40,059
with the community so we see huge

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,640
benefits at Intel to using open source

00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:45,429
I'm a big fan myself I have been for a

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,020
long time I really appreciate that I can

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:51,150
actually look at what's going on in the

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,230
stack I can talk to people who are

00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,909
unencumbered and willing to talk to me

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:56,169
about what's going on I can help fix

00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:00,720
things when I see that they're broken

00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:05,200
and we're a huge believer that it will

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,419
you know increase the ability of all of

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,559
us to use and benefit from all of these

00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:13,950
things so let's work together to make

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:18,190
Linux the best choice for networking and

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:20,409
see where the future can take us so

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:23,640
remember everything's on the network and

00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,640
the network runs on Linux

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:40,590
questions comments there comes to home

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:47,940
ah ha ha

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:49,289
IOT thanks for the presentation Jesse I

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,909
really like that you mentioned AI again

00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:54,120
that's cool

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:57,720
you mentioned the crypto offload being

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,700
required I find that kind of an

00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,470
interesting statement from someone

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,470
coming to Intel so we the history of

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,710
this obviously we've wanted this 20

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:10,200
years ago several vendors back then

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,929
tried to put IPSec and the devices a

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,460
long history of it almost works it

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,899
doesn't work and then every time it

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,520
seems like Intel just comes up with a

00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,059
new instruction set that kind of

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,679
obsoletes that technology yep do you see

00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:24,690
something different now or are we at the

00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,450
limits of like what what's going to be

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,850
in the CPU so we have to offload it to a

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,159
device or is this some are you referring

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:36,929
to some sort of NCP you offload for the

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:40,919
crypto in my mind we're thinking about

00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:43,020
how the the crypto is sometimes limiting

00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,260
when it's provided by offload devices

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,149
like like lookaside offload or in the

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,470
cpu so the CPU might be able to do it

00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,240
very fast but then you can't get it on

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,370
the network as quickly right that's the

00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,880
case with IPSec today if it's done in

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:59,039
the CPU it ends up having to be it can't

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,510
be segmented by the the Hardware

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,120
segmentation engines on the device so

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,740
you only get like 1 CPUs worth of

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,630
throughput from a single IPSec

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,120
connection right so that's the kind of

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,070
thing that I'm talking about where and

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,799
especially like with tunnels we want to

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,360
be able to encrypt tunnels and a lot of

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,010
times you don't want to even be telling

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,870
the network consumers that you're

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,340
encrypting the tunnel maybe the furnace

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,529
alright read of ice or for a container

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,510
or for something else it you may want to

00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,370
just stuff data in from the application

00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:30,510
side and have it be encrypted on the

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:32,340
network so I'm a firm believer that the

00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,690
that you can't really accelerate traffic

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,669
onto the network unless you have good

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,970
offload that includes encryption so

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,890
things like TSO so thinking about the 50

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,570
billion number though mm-hmm I'm

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,610
skeptical those are going to be using

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:46,960
IPSec if any

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:50,300
Livia's in TLS over tcp but TLS is

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,690
really hard to tell flood I think we're

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:55,910
making some good progress on that

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,200
so I guess sentain it's a it's an

00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,710
interesting question but I'm still a

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,360
little skeptical that crypto offload

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,520
yeah I agree crystal offload is a really

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,900
hard problem and like I said I think

00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,010
that we're gonna in order to have secure

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,350
communications you got to have the

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,180
devices being secure all the time right

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:13,520
if you offer a device that doesn't use

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,800
crypto people are gonna buy it because

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,810
it'll be cheaper right and then all your

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,990
you know IOT device stuff is running out

00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:23,260
in the world and then I burn a CPU so

00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,800
which is cheaper CPU or the device

00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:29,650
that's a good point

00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:32,950
thanks for your question all right uh

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,880
thanks Jesse let's give him 100

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:38,549
