Description: 
	Sowmini Varadhan chairs the TCP Analytics Workshop
at Netdev 0x13 with numerous speakers from many
organizations.

There are numerous cases of TCP performance challenges and
anomalies reported in production environments that are very
hard to debug, raising an interest in the answer to the
question "how to monitor TCP flows efficiently".

The workshop constituted the sharing of experience from
folks who deal with TCP Analytics Extraction at very large
TCP deployments from several organizations. Discussions
include descriptions of the instrumentation used at these
organizations, the motivation behind these diagnostics,
and ways to improve/enhance this as we go forward
