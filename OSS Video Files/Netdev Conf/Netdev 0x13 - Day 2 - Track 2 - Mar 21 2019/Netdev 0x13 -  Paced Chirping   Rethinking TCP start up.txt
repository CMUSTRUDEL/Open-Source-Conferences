Title: Netdev 0x13 -  Paced Chirping   Rethinking TCP start up

Description: 
	Joakim Misund and Bob Briscoe talk about Paced Chirping.

TCP slow start faces a dilemma: Either you take too long to ramp up or you ramp up too fast
and cause significant queuing delays.  Paced Chirping gets a flow to achieve
fast acceleration with virtually no queuing delay

The implementation extends the kernel's pacing framework to allow a congestion control
module to create "chirps" with desired characteristics. Bob describes
the implementation and how one would use the extensions.
