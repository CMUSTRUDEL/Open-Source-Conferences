Title: Netdev 0x13 - End to end networking with ILNP in Linux
Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2 - Track 2 - Mar 21 2019
Description: 
	Saleem Bhatti talks about ILNP on Linux.
The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) is defined as an Experimental Internet
Protocol by the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) in RFCs 6740-6748.
At the heart of the ILNP architecture is the desire to address the deprecation of IP addresses. ILNP replaces IP address semantics with use of node Identifiers and network Locators using IPv6. No application changes needed.
Current kernel implementation is on top of 4.19. Ryo and Saleem plan to upgrade to a newer kernel and push upstream. In this talk Saleem describes the ILNP architecture, the kernel implementation of ILNP and include results of testbed experiments for IP-level mobility.
