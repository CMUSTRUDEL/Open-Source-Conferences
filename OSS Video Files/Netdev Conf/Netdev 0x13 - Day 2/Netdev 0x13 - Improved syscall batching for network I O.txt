Title: Netdev 0x13 - Improved syscall batching for network I O
Publication date: 2019-05-25
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	Rahul Jadhav, Zhen Cao and Anmol Sarma talk about improving Network applications performance by improving syscall batching.
Applicaction can benefit from reduced CPU cycles by amortizing the system call overhead of
network I/O operations. In this talk Rahul et al review two existing interfaces for network I/O batching namely recvmmsg()/sendmmsg() and SO_RCVLOWAT and then
propose extensions to these mechanisms.

They show an 8x syscall reduction with our traffic patterns (gaming scenarios) with the usage of
such extensions.
