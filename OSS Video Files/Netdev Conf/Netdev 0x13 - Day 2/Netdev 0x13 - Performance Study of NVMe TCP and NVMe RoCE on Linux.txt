Title: Netdev 0x13 - Performance Study of NVMe TCP and NVMe RoCE on Linux
Publication date: 2019-05-25
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	With the addition of NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) on Linux (using TCP),
there is that elephant in the room question that needs to be answered.
Is there a performance impact when using TCP instead of an RDMA transport
such as RoCE?

Ariel Cohen believes has some answers. In his talk he describes a performance
study comparing NVMe/TCP to NVMe/RoCE on Linux. Throughput, latency
distribution, and CPU load are measured and compared. A performance
comparison of these kernel protocols to user-level protocols using SPDK
are also described.
