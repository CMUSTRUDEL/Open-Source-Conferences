Publication date: 2019-05-25
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	Jamal Hadi Salim digs deep into the ugly^WBeatiful 32 bit TC classifier.
U32 is the mother of all classifiers in the linux kernel. It is the only native classifier that can be taught by a user policy "how to" classify based on user traffic heuristics. U32 is a low level classifier operating on packet-offset-length-value. Sometimes this could be confusing for the faint-hearted.

In this talk, Jamal digs deep into u32-land to show basic principles and expose flexibility
for customization. He illustrates customization use cases for a small(hundreds of rules)
and a medium sized (10s of thousands of rules) LAN access control and provides
performance numbers.
