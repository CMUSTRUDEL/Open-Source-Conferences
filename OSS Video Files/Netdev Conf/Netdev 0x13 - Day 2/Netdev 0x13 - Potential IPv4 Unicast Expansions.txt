Title: Netdev 0x13 - Potential IPv4 Unicast Expansions
Publication date: 2019-06-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	Dave Taht talks about an approach to make available more IPv4 addresses.

There is a dollar cost to IPv4 addresses: 15 to 20 a piece and that price is going up!
And, no IPv6 is still not taking over the world yet. So John Gilmore, Dave Taht and Paul Wouters
want to squeeze more out of that IPv4 address space. They believe there are a few hundreds of millions of addresses that can be liberated for this good cause.
They have started the march to freedom for those addresses. They have some patches already accepted into the kernel and some pending for distros, vendors, routing daemons, userland tools, etc.
