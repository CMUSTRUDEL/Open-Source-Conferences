Title: Netdev 0x13 - Potential IPv4 Unicast Expansions
Publication date: 2019-06-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	Dave Taht talks about an approach to make available more IPv4 addresses.

There is a dollar cost to IPv4 addresses: 15 to 20 a piece and that price is going up!
And, no IPv6 is still not taking over the world yet. So John Gilmore, Dave Taht and Paul Wouters
want to squeeze more out of that IPv4 address space. They believe there are a few hundreds of millions of addresses that can be liberated for this good cause.
They have started the march to freedom for those addresses. They have some patches already accepted into the kernel and some pending for distros, vendors, routing daemons, userland tools, etc.

hi I'm Dave Todd most of you know me

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,099
through the buffer bloat and Sarah wort

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:13,290
and make Wi-Fi fast projects how many

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,759
here use Wi-Fi yeah sket cake was our

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,699
latest effort that landed the Linux

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,930
kernel in 4.19 and once that was done I

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,330
got involved in doing something

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,830
completely different but it's not as

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,529
well known I do an other stuff I'm

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,720
really proud to say in particular that

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,720
the arkyd six spacecraft successfully

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,180
flew last year I'm not so happy I can't

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:58,760
talk about it that much but it was nice

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:58,760
and I also play guitar sorry with porn

00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:04,739
so I wanted to start off by asking the

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:13,950
room how many of you think the ipv6

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:16,290
deployment is going well about I've

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,970
worked very hard on ipv6 I've worked in

00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,409
the Sarawak project like I said and

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,840
worked on a whole bunch of RFC's

00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,490
internet drafts and a couple years ago I

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,220
felt that we were going to be running

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,369
into some more difficulty and John

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,009
Gilmore who founded the e FF came to me

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,750
and said you have to see this data and I

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,780
looked at over and I had a revelatory

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:42,750
moment it's not every day that happens

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:46,140
and I would here we go sorry

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,180
and I I saw some of the graphs in this

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,619
particular paper that I'm citing here

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,970
and I had a I had a bad moment and for

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,009
the last six months I've been trying to

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,439
with a small team trying to come up with

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,899
some ideas for this

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,860
does anyone here agree with this

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,399
statement

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,240
legacy ipv4 will exist with ipv6

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,240
indefinitely

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:17,070
just for 10 years whoever believed that

00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:20,670
ipv6 will replace ipv4 in 10 years 20

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,610
who here has no opinion raise your hands

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,290
[Laughter]

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:31,930
so I just tried to flick the slide

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:38,190
nothing happened guys how is it supposed

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:40,990
to be green button oh there we go

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,670
even if they've deployed ipv6 and this

00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,010
is the really fundamental insight from

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,990
this paper growing networks must

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,360
continue to acquire scarce and

00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,710
increasingly expensive ipv4 addresses to

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,500
interconnect with the rest of the

00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,630
internet until you reached a 100 percent

00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:03,010
deployment of ipv6 it's very difficult

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:06,340
to coexist with ipv4 so unicast

00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:08,230
addressing one for ipv4 we tried

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,840
multicast and didn't work all that well

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,630
a large percentage of the traffic is the

00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,030
globally look globally routed unicast

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,670
and global unicast addresses are the

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,130
ones we run out of and everything else

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,830
if you don't care about really and right

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,110
now there's a nascent ipv4 address

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,570
market you can go and get a slash 24 if

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,350
you want it's sort of like hey buddy can

00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:39,630
IP address how much you want for that

00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:42,130
and but it is evolving it is there and

00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,320
people like myself care we innovators

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,360
need addresses the big incumbents are

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,890
out there buying up everyone they can

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,540
find in the existing market there is and

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,790
I'm always professionally running

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:57,190
startups and it's nice to be able to

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:03,900
interoperate it's ok if we all want to

00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:08,020
internet innovation to stop so

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,670
speculators say by the end they buying

00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,930
and making any more of it but we can

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:18,100
make more ipv4 addresses it's not hard

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:21,810
it's just a few patches spec change now

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,810
at five to seven years to deploy

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:29,530
so once your tech geeks got together

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,600
notice what was going on and I wanted to

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,280
stress this is entirely a moonshot talk

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,930
it's not a linux issue it's not a BSD

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,150
issue it's a Windows issue it's a

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,020
protocol issue with technical and

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,730
political aspects so John Gilmore who is

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,620
known to many of you for many reasons

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,220
was the original author of bootp and

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:54,340
dhcp and they went on to do other things

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,560
Paul waters who can't talk anymore whose

00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,300
areas in the room I was going to share a

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,010
talk with he's too sick to talk we have

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,560
a recent addition Rodney Grimes and

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,390
FreeBSD here with us today and then

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,780
there's me and I've already mentioned my

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:11,530
stuff and we believe in running code and

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:15,940
rough consensus whoops what happened

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:20,169
there so the internet isn't finished and

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,790
it's a success disaster it arose from

00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,590
the contributions of many people over

00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,930
time and there was no grand plan anyone

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,240
here to think there was a grand plan go

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,120
I'm glad I'm unified on that one there's

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
no deities the Internet's more than the

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,310
World Wide Web

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,640
I don't think anything that these things

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,410
are controversial and the internet is

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,350
not finished there's much yet to be

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:44,800
created it's a wonderful talk by Carl

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,210
Hart Bach so but we do have to

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,919
understand some of the history behind

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,470
how we got to where we were today with

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,870
IP before we started off with the

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:57,090
concept of a Class A Class B and a Class

00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,090
C address how many people remember those

00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:05,310
and zero eight was fine my network

00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,860
number IP was designed before Ethernet

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,860
existed and it turned out that each and

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:17,640
net had was too big to squeeze into even

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:21,380
a Class A so the zero idea died and came

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:25,140
back was retired in 89 and fixed

00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,600
similarly to 24 / 4 was reserved for

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,450
multicast in a massive amount of

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,670
enthusiasm for the idea in the early 80s

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:34,530
I'm just curious how many people know

00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:40,740
how many a multicast addresses are in

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:43,260
use today as multicast okay 240 was

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:48,000
reserved for experimental use and no

00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:50,100
experiment ever happened it turned out

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,080
by the mid early nineties a Class A B

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,640
and C didn't fit real networks and then

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,720
we replace it with company called cider

00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:01,050
wish I was in 92 93 94 and that took

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,850
years and years of the play and 2 to 4

00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,030
mm-hmm I'm not going to talk about that

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,680
yet so one of the things we worked at

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,750
proposing with actual patches and

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,330
running code was a small specification

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,370
gate changed the ipv4 a couple small

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,530
patches to kernels and user spaces and

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,180
configs and routers a bunch of test beds

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,460
which we have up and running today and

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,320
we iterate until we have running code

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,510
and proof of concept that made sense and

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,000
that only tackled the politics

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,500
I've had enough politics for one month

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,810
let me tell you so running code

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,820
consensus first screwed the last attempt

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:40,260
at trying to make 240 globally usable

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:42,240
ten years ago I don't know I don't see

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,800
any future use for any of these IP

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
addresses reusing does anybody have a

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,110
future use for multicast at large scale

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,170
with over 128 million addresses reserved

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:55,380
for nothing raise your hands so we still

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,590
have a use for multicast and that's good

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,410
I'm glad we agree on that one and zero

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:04,380
is pretty cool so far as I know it I

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,000
know I'll get to that anyway we also had

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,800
some more controversial proposals that

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,879
we wanted to run by people after doing a

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,939
bunch more tests one two seven hasn't

00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:19,020
at 16 million addresses reserved for it

00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:21,119
how many do you think are in use well

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,929
that's more than this more than one but

00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:27,830
it seems to be less than four sixteen

00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:30,899
million addresses totally unused and

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,649
nice play community cast let's use them

00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:34,289
for something

00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,659
similarly the multicast problem even

00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:37,319
though multicast has a huge allocation a

00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,419
set aside

00:08:37,319 --> 00:08:44,039
128 million were reserved for future use

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,610
and never allocated okay here is what it

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,850
takes

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:53,069
most of what it takes to make zero work

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:54,630
16 million addresses today arguably we

00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:56,670
should rename the function to something

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,230
and that involves touching 22 files but

00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,649
that's all we need to make it work in

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,509
Linux

00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:05,160
today there's some other minor spec

00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,600
changes I know that the address thing is

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,029
kind of controversial or I thought it

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,399
would be walking in the door but the

00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:14,699
zeroth address got reserved for

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,370
broadcast back then and then we fixed

00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:19,439
that DSD when the DSD 4.3 rolled out we

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,930
didn't need 0 anymore and little traces

00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:24,000
of that and and classful routing

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:28,649
existent all the code in the world that

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,189
should probably get cleaned up I don't

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:35,250
want to talk about that others move on

00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:37,860
so we're here with some test codes and

00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,300
stuff on the cloud and setups and so on

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,740
that we're gonna talk about over the

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,060
course of the week and at the coming

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:49,920
IETF in terms of technical feasibility

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:52,439
as much as we can one piece of news that

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,680
you know some of you may not have is AWS

00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:57,300
already permits use of all the addresses

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,120
and the reserved address range for any

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,220
purpose you want I am pretty sure

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,930
several people in the room know where

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,319
else these addresses are currently being

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,050
used

00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:12,689
anyway together some new ideas it's the

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,120
work I think we can take some of the

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:17,399
previously reserved address ranges and

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,699
make them into usable and globally

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:25,699
routable eyepiece thank you very much

00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:25,699
questions

00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:33,810
you know okay so the basic thesis here

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,750
is there's a bunch of IP address space

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,750
you can hear yeah

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,000
so the basic thesis is there's a bunch

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,930
of ipv4 addresses that are reserved that

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,540
you want to free up and use yes so given

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,399
that these addresses have never been

00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,589
used the obvious question is if I start

00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,450
to use these in the Internet will they

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,930
actually pass through the internet so

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:03,750
that seems to me it seems to me to be

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,459
the big blocker here yeah their IP IP

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,529
addresses but what if somebody says oh

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:10,350
this is multicast and they toss it on

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:12,959
the floor automatically so that's gonna

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,910
be the big thing is whether or not these

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,339
are actually deployable and what we want

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,670
to avoid is getting into another rollout

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:23,130
of ipv6 where this is going to fix ipv6

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,260
but then that ends up taking as long as

00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:28,950
ipv6 to get deployed so we don't want

00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,900
another IP v10 for instance well overall

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,550
we are we are keeping a website up

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,380
that's taking bug reports and statements

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:37,230
like that in the hope that we continue

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,360
to work forward I can I was hoping for a

00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,550
line of people with pitchforks coming at

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,050
me at the microphone but I can take some

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,050
kind of obvious right

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,640
the deployment problem is very difficult

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,130
yes I don't think you're gonna have much

00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,959
argument that ipv4 isn't going away I

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,540
mean there was a article just the other

00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,120
week that basically gave a very gloomy

00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,200
picture of these things so that probably

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,529
that argument problem you're not gonna

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,970
see it's just is it deployed so handling

00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,800
the deployability argument two things

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:11,220
one is if we can make this work there's

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,839
obvious demand for more ipv4 yes so I've

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,220
actually believed that if we make this

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,770
stuff work that will actually create

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,810
demand for new operating systems that do

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:25,200
ipv6 better make it handle of the curve

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:27,209
on both sides better okay the others

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,829
other point nothing that we've described

00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:29,750
is anything less than a five to seven

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:31,630
year plan

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,519
[Laughter]

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,560
but as I talked about earlier it looks

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,810
like we may well be stuck with ipv4 for

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,240
a very long time and doing stuff to

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,920
clean up cider and clean up ipv4 and

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,320
make it as usable as possible strikes me

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,269
as a good idea so in terms of

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,820
implementation this was just a small

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:51,970
patch to get this to working legs I have

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,240
the patches are up on the website they

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,970
are for very small patches I'd intended

00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,769
to submit them as RFC s for this talk

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,620
they have been thoroughly tested we also

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,720
have patches for FreeBSD and open wrt

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,079
and so on have you posted the patches

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,550
tentative not yet I probably would be

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,589
good for reviewed some other comments

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,300
again I was expecting the pitchfork

00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,490
Begay to come out and all of you going

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,500
yes this is good this might be good okay

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:31,630
so I'll try to get them posted later and

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:33,910
so on honey merger sorry I'm I'm Paul

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,670
about it so I'll try to just say a few

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:40,240
nights because my voice is gone but and

00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:43,329
so we we did a grep over all of the

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,630
software and fedora and we found that of

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:49,060
the 4400 packages there are only like 85

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,430
that are actually specifically using the

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,339
macros from I n dot age that are talking

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:58,329
about the bad class or the N multicast

00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:59,649
or the in loopback modes and so that's a

00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:01,269
very small percentage I think from a

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:03,370
software point of view we're actually

00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,079
really good that is not much change that

00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,850
need to happen but of course from the

00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,680
routing point of view on a node dave has

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,829
worked on some routers as well so maybe

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,959
you can say a bit more about the router

00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:15,730
if you did I do have a member of a group

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,199
here that might want to speak would you

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:26,410
like to talk about the routing question

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:27,819
Alistair I think boils down to two

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,660
things right there's the software

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:33,670
routing stuff which I think FRR and some

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,139
of the other projects has dealt with but

00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,959
the real question is has anybody

00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:39,730
implemented stuff in silicon and in

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,819
hardware so I think the answer to that

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,420
is unknown I agree the answer is unknown

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,850
and

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,250
the software we have this we have

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,080
patches for FRR at burg outstanding are

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,790
ready right so I don't think that's

00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,840
gonna be an issue but the real issue is

00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:57,460
is deployed silicon that's out there and

00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,630
and any of the legacy hardware that

00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,030
you're not going to be able to get

00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,650
software updates so you can either look

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,210
at this as a bug or a feature right

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:07,000
depending on whether you're a vendor and

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,860
trying to you know churn hardware or

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,280
whether you're an operator who doesn't

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,840
want to deal with legacy equipment but

00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:21,460
back to your point it's a seven year

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:23,160
project so I would like to disagree on a

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,720
high level point here so I agree that

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,280
ipv6 will not a before will not go away

00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,710
it will stay there for a long time if

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,330
you have a system running on ipv4 it's

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,180
running nicely why should you change it

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,280
right but I don't think that like trying

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,710
to get the rest of the IP addresses in

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,120
work to solve any problem because it

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,530
would just delay the point where you're

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,420
out of IP addresses a little bit later

00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,490
like another five to seven years but

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,550
then you have the same problem again so

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:51,070
I disagree that there's a need for more

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,660
ipv4 addresses I think the reason why

00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:54,040
people think they need an ipv4 address

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,970
is because there is perceived difference

00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,230
between ipv4 and ipv6 and to get and to

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,120
get to the point where people can

00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,360
actually use ipv6 as a replacement for

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,620
ipv4 we should put our efforts in making

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,030
ipv6 working better and make people

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,040
taking away the need for new ipv4

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,290
addresses by making it work on ipv6

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,580
nicely that's a very common argument I'm

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,380
curious how many people in this room

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:22,330
agree with that argument that's good

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,910
roughly 2/3 the room agrees with you

00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,800
today and I'm cool with that I agreed

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,470
with you until I saw these charts about

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,360
the actual deployment pace and the fact

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,920
that it's hit a plateau so I'd recommend

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,930
everyone that believes in that argument

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,670
to read what I cited on this thing and

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,050
try to argue with that rather than me

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,060
thank you very much

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,150
I'd like to go to lunch now how about

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,589
everybody else

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:54,600
any more questions there's one two three

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:56,670
okay hello and marek from culture I have

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,640
two points so first we did very similar

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:03,110
work on getting one that went well but

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,420
one working so it is painful to get the

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,660
previously yeah weird address is working

00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,610
and the second thing is I can't argue

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,490
for the whole internet but on the attack

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:17,640
site we do see very very often very

00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,100
weird ranges attacking us like one to

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,020
seven or the multicast ones so it's

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,589
definitely not like blocked all around

00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,510
the internet

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,949
there definitely wrote that that was

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,929
actually one of the encouraging pieces

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:31,080
data they had being it we could actually

00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:33,720
trace route to 240 that whatever slash

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,880
for from many devices that had an

00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,230
implement at BC p38 they wandered around

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,230
that they had a border router

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,730
yeah we shouldn't be able to leverage

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,150
the experience with 1.1.1 with rolling

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,860
out these additional ranges to 40 / 4 is

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,960
it an enormous address space and I think

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:02,160
that that is past time that we try to

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:08,220
free that up next I'm sorry I'm little

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:12,180
death so thank you and this was a no

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,180
shot talk just remember anyway good

00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,299
thank you very much let's go to lunch

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,299
