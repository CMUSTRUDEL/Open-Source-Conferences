Title: Netdev 0x13 - Shenango: Achieving High CPU Efficiency for Latency sensitive Datacenter Workloads
Publication date: 2019-07-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	In this talk Amy Ousterhout describes the approach taken by Shenango which achieves
great CPU efficiency while maintaining the high request rates.

Datacenter applications demand microsecond-scale tail latencies and high request rates from operating systems. Achieving these goals in a CPU-efficient way is an open problem. Because of the high overheads of todayâ€™s kernel, the best available solution to achieve
microsecond-scale latencies is kernel-bypass networking, which dedicates CPU cores to applications for spin-polling the network card. But this approach wastes CPU: even at
modest average loads, one must dedicate enough cores for the peak expected load.
