Title: Netdev 0x13 - Implementing the Next Generation of Network Telemetry Technologies
Publication date: 2019-05-25
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	Telemetry is now an important part of networking. Standards and proposals for
producing and consuming metadata are emerging. In this talk, Andy Gospodarek
introduces two such standards: INT and IFA. He describes the hardware
requirements and implementation challenges. He further proposes approaches
for configuring INT/IFA for the kernel and supported hardware which attempts to
minimize risk associated with deploying early specs.
