Title: Netdev 0x13 - AF GRAFT, A new address family for containerized applications
Publication date: 2019-05-25
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2
Description: 
	Ryo Nakamura believes we can take container networking to a new level.

Why do we still need to use old-school virtual ports (think veth) for inter-container networking?
In this talk, Ryo introduces a new socket family, AF_GRAFT, for containers. Instead of the link between the host and container network stacks, AF_GRAFT provides a socket-layer interconnection between them.
