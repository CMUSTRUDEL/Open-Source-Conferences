Title: Netdev 0x12 - Restructuring Endpoint Congestion Control
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 3 - Jul 13 2018
Description: 
	From the same folks at MIT who brought you the idea of Congestion Manager (Linux being able to plugin different congestion control algorithms) came an exciting idea to bring even more modularity into Linux TCP. CM concepts that were harder to put into the kernel are now possible.

On July 13th, 2018 at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal, Akshay Narayan and Frank Cangialosi discussed Congestion Control Plane (CCP).
CCP is a new way of separating sender side TCP into control (sitting in user space) and datapath (sitting in the kernel). Control state from the kernel is used by algorithms in user space. User space algorithms use this information to control the kernelâ€™s congestion window or pacing rate.

The talk described the details of the design principles used, kernel refactoring made, libccp which exposes user API, and experimental results from the implementation.
