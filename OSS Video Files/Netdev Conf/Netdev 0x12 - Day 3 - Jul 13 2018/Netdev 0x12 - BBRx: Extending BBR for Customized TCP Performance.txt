Title: Netdev 0x12 - BBRx: Extending BBR for Customized TCP Performance
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 3 - Jul 13 2018
Description: 
	The future of optimal TCP involves robots! On July 13th, 2018 at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal, Jae Won Chung discussed an extension to BBR called BBRx which is loosely coupled to machine learning.
He described how they study TCP path attributes in user space at runtime to find an optimal throughput-delay operating point. The results are then fed back to the kernel to tweak it.

Performance of BBRx is evaluated in both LTE mobile as well as telco wireline environments and compared with classical CUBIC and BBR.
