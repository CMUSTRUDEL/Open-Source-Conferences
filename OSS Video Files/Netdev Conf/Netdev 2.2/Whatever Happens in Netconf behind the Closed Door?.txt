	00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:06,390
okay so they're gonna start the

00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,869
proceedings for today we're gonna do the

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,280
first session is going to be a slightly

00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:12,869
innovative experience we've never done

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,619
this before and then dev to the best of

00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:18,450
my recollection we have a battle here of

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,940
people who attend this thing called net

00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:26,550
conf and how many people here know what

00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:28,350
net confit is okay we'll find out during

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,570
the course of this talk if your

00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,789
understanding of that corn is has any

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,010
bearing with reality that's the point of

00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,899
this particular session when you have

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,569
these panel members explained to us a

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,069
little bit more about net comp and

00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:42,420
basically the role that it serves and

00:00:41,069 --> 00:00:44,879
why we are doing some of the things that

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,559
we're doing here in this way so to get

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,379
the ball rolling we are going to do a

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,149
rapid-fire introduction set and we're

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,460
gonna start with Jasper on that and then

00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,870
speak to three sentences about you what

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,600
you work on what are the key things that

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,600
you focus on and pass the Michael

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,799
so the thing you have to worry about

00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:48,450
Jesper is that he takes things to the

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,440
nth degree of the session like he

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,659
specializes in taking something and

00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,539
actually understanding everything about

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,860
its history its geography its neighbors

00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,450
and everything else you need to know

00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,759
about it and then come up with something

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,759
that's pretty darn good most of the time

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,079
and the thing you have to know about

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,510
Jamel is that he will talk about any

00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,840
part of the network code if you give him

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,840
a chance

00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:38,820
because that's just work okay I have a

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,620
few reform questions what I would

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,340
strongly encourage is audience

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,650
participation right so the goal would be

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,360
to get to a point where everybody has a

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,180
fair amount of understanding of what

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,090
happens in this thing called net confer

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,880
a lot of the structure and elements of

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,100
what will be emphasized what will be

00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,590
focused on in the kernel is is sort of

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,370
decided for the next number weeks months

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,930
hours forever so encourage audience

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,950
participation what I would like is

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,890
there's a

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,629
the audience please ask questions if you

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,180
are not comfortable your item notes

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,980
ended up here I'll ask them for you of

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,380
course then we tell everybody who asked

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,320
the question and then that Anana man who

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,860
lost but ask questions make it a little

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,090
bit more interactive so to kick it off

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,370
question number one and we're going to

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,750
have this open to all panelists one by

00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,669
one and we'll do it in reverse order

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,350
because it's the most efficient way to

00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:40,229
govern Salinas that's already been

00:04:34,350 --> 00:05:05,310
traverse what is net come to you and and

00:04:40,229 --> 00:05:08,600
we've to answer the question as of the

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,600
thing that most remember

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,750
[Music]

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,070
long term so sort of helpful from a

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,240
standpoint of versus to see budget

00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:39,900
analyst although the people with them

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,520
Network stack on okay different places

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,960
to get to see each other and so on so

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,970
you see the chance to face to face

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,930
discussions about people being a problem

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,630
they have individual solutions proposed

00:05:51,930 --> 00:06:01,030
solutions and it's an instantaneous

00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:04,930
feedback discuss problems at arm so I

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:10,360
think I would always solution it's a

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:16,540
nice way to to get together I see you at

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:21,700
the end I can also confirm these two

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:24,970
days well to me I think what number one

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:27,940
is an opportunity to get to have a good

00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,360
attention from them but those do be

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,160
assault

00:06:28,360 --> 00:07:29,700
actually I show

00:06:29,160 --> 00:07:31,740
I understand so so the summary statement

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,720
is that it's all about collaboration and

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,210
being able to actually do things in

00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,800
person that are sometimes gnarly

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,430
sometimes have religious debates

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,590
sometimes leads to divergent thought

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,440
that needs to really reach some sort of

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:50,460
conclusion and those things can be

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,940
sorted out as a special bonus for this

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,550
question

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,160
maybe we last day if you get something

00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,360
to say to us

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:04,910
no comment instance you can relax the

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,680
pretend Dave is not here part of it okay

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,480
we'll do this now again back in Reverse

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,910
and I remind the audience if you have

00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,680
questions like why didn't this thing get

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,630
discussed in that confirm was this

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,669
discussed in that corner this was the

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,590
kind of place and time to ask those

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,620
questions but we'll do this in Reverse

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,979
now so pick

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,229
a thing that actually was useful so

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:30,150
maybe like give us the general audience

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,339
a little bit more of a flavor of that

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,320
like a particular topic that got

00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:42,810
discussed and maybe got discussed and

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:45,500
got discussed and discussed and then in

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,500
the past and

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,910
their concerns and other people waste

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,029
their motivation adding all these new

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:37,350
features we were able to come up with

00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:42,569
different solutions to explore to try to

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:44,550
get one happy you still have from the

00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:47,970
might be different different cases

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,639
because one solutions there are this bit

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,319
it is the gist of it is to do it in the

00:09:50,639 --> 00:10:01,139
face to face with three or four

00:09:52,319 --> 00:10:04,069
different interested parties we are not

00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,069
being able to achieve that

00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:15,669
don't all sign up for number two at the

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:35,529
same time who wants to go next I see

00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:37,509
John is very eager people that are

00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:48,719
trying to do different things to see

00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:48,719
these cases I think the motivation

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:01,970
I have really enjoyed to to hear about

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:04,370
the new cases behind all the content

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:09,170
online so I go to here watch my Google

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:13,880
story and I'm saying oh it's really cool

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,380
to use it this way now okay I understand

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,560
why you try to push to go to this

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,560
direction

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,160
Tremonti are uniquely positioned to be

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:52,250
what kind of chatter is that you may not

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,600
have a lot of appreciation for I don't

00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,480
think anybody can write a paper for that

00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:03,620
and show up at negative and say you know

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:09,130
we presented it to the platform for the

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:11,420
multimedia us the multi host just

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,480
Facebook craziness in terms of is

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:17,120
actually industry we have our head of

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,310
the game we could have seen that we were

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,170
likely to have access to people homeless

00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,170
big organizations with Linux

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:51,610
the other one where the Google is so

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,560
I'll actually add over online because

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,600
it's I think important and especially if

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,300
you're not in net cons to understand

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,580
that this is what happens a lot I think

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,100
the few that I've attended I it's very

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:06,620
clear that a lot of problems that are

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,020
facing the Linux networking code today

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,480
and I guess more than just networking is

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,060
is that Linux is getting pulled into n

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,240
different applications and almost always

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:19,340
the the tension is between speed and

00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,460
features it's somebody wants to do

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:26,000
something special they want to do it at

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,250
high speed and the person who's who

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,110
cares about speed is going I don't want

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:32,720
any more to be added to my thing I

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,220
want it to be lean mean and fast and the

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,800
person who needs the future is going

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,830
well I mean I just need another 5% thing

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,620
and this is a problem that is incredibly

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,330
hard to solve in a mailing list because

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,550
unless you're writing papers like the

00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,620
man said it's very hard to put forth an

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,770
argument that says this is why you

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,930
should care about this and not on the

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,360
thing I've seen is that it's actually a

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,090
pretty good spot where people with no

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,340
resistance with mostly a constructive

00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,410
perspective present what they want and

00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,920
either people say that's full of in

00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:08,450
a good way in a very constructive way or

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,010
they say that makes sense I understand

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,780
and let's go figure out if he can make

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,040
it work out for you

00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,040
Gemara looks like he's

00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:22,600
seems after a few beers and Eric is

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:26,860
banging on the table that he's unhappy

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,170
about Erie putting 1rc you check then

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,210
you know that that actually very

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:46,240
important because he's gonna break the

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:52,240
table the big deal is just one hour see

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:55,120
you there's not so much contention at

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,340
this year's event I'm saying no more no

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,080
tables were damaged in Korea so so

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,800
you're saying that you only remember the

00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:12,040
law when one metcon stack and no tables

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:16,230
are damaged in that stacks okay so now

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:20,920
we're gonna go yeah question Steve Mike

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:23,230
Mike's coming up the other thing that

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,900
people need to realize is it's not the

00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:42,760
case that only the things that are

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:45,010
discussed yes it's not

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,830
I think if Dave was here he would say

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,990
that net conscious not expedited

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,480
Clearing House strategy it's more of

00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,080
here are important contentious things

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,080
that we'll discuss

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,120
so yeah it's it's it's not the place

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,370
where you hand me an envelope inside of

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,980
a book and then your changes go in but

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,860
that's not what's happening at that cop

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,910
it is your opportunity to get my

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,430
attention

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,640
undivided if you feed me enough coffee

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:23,430
and another thing to take consideration

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,900
is that when groups of people this love

00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,610
will get together you know exactly who

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,010
your target audience is and you don't

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,540
need to adjust your delivery at all you

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,550
just go straight to the facts traits and

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,780
what's important and know that the

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,520
person was since you understand

00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,590
everything completely so it's really a

00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,520
unique environment to discuss the

00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:40,080
problems that you're thinking about

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:42,560
every single day so that's basically

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,560
what it's all about

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,080
[Music]

00:16:49,490 --> 00:17:02,460
I'm not disagreeing until he leaves the

00:16:52,080 --> 00:17:04,829
room okay all right so will now go to a

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,800
slightly more fun version then so what

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:10,470
was the most fun disagreement from met

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,930
cons that you remember so and and you

00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,790
know use characteristics like oh man

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:18,300
this discussion ran for one and a half

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:30,960
of the two days or this thing resulted

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:33,920
in broken tables or takes the peace

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,920
table that's um

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:49,320
yeah but this is not this one no swine

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:52,800
takes two peas like in now but like

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:57,060
before if we had some people disagreeing

00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,400
heavily around around this that yes it

00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:07,650
was also at the account and get

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:08,310
discussions around this there's a

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,870
disagreement

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,170
but there's probably discussions I don't

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,090
know and not over yet like they would

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,610
join I may still have to talk to him

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:22,860
about being able to copy from one socket

00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:25,770
in one namespace to another I may have I

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:32,280
still have an issue is the flag you

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:37,620
wanna sit on you see the users wanted

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:40,380
but yeah so I mean what you're getting

00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:44,460
now is probably a unique preview into

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,080
next net cons contention topics and we

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:51,390
should be happy we're setting it up for

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,730
you so one more yes I just - I do - John

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,290
it's not that I dislike the idea I think

00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,450
it's a great idea I just thought I

00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:04,650
thought about it but nobody will ever

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:13,610
agree to me doing this I do remember one

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:28,260
of the songs I attended and in question

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:31,620
he jumped up and he he felt very

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:40,280
strongly about a point when we discussed

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:44,850
it suppose so so it's the criteria for

00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,840
good discussion 45 minutes one and a

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,470
half hours

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,700
today one-day duties of the individual

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,950
topics yeah

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,470
so the it's a fairly unstructured event

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,750
so basically Iran gets opportunity to

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,940
talk but how long they talk for is is

00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,159
set by by themselves okay my question

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,320
was for you guys do you remember the

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,440
topic has had a lot of discussion if it

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,960
went last half an hour one hour half a

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,289
day one bit what's the cutoff for you

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,610
guys I know in my opinion a good

00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:20,880
discussion a London comes to a

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:22,770
conclusion regardless of link what's

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:41,700
your favorite memory is it the one Jamal

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:43,350
disagreed with you just know most things

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,480
are sort of resolved after discussions

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,840
and sometimes a few things carry over as

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,809
multiple night comes and die and large

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:57,320
things get resolved nothing stands out

00:20:51,809 --> 00:21:08,760
really I think that's a beer talking so

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:10,860
the thing I remember from you know the

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,820
cutoff being at half an hour it's

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:17,549
probably better this way but and also

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,309
one thing I need to mention we had in

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:23,279
Prior on it confirms very interesting

00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:26,250
stuff about Q risks stuff being rough

00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,950
letters whatever and so sometimes you

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,990
reach an agreement of how it should be

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,820
done but actually with

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:40,230
which to other girls or date robes and

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:42,750
so that's gonna be so that's so

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,179
sometimes we agree to to have a very

00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:54,720
good solution but nobody actually

00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:56,580
implemented it so something any

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,440
disagreements from the audience

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:04,110
anybody answers no I think that's not

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:06,690
right no questions okay we'll keep going

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,330
along the same lines then and actually

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:11,970
again I will ask for more audience

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,450
participation I think that I think

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:18,120
always comes up right if I look at the

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,950
tragic view of Mein Kampf itself and all

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,010
the things that have that I have seen in

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,679
the notes or have been present for what

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,360
I see is that there is a lot of always

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,780
the things that drive the most

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,540
discussion is are things that have high

00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,640
importance it's typically quite well

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,580
correlated something that has deep

00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,230
impact gets everybody's attention

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:42,090
something that doesn't have deep impact

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,590
tends to go through very quickly there

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,710
are some exceptions that I can think of

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:49,500
but in general it is proportional to the

00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,350
effort that's put in but one of the

00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,929
things that is to carry on from where it

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:56,700
left off is how are things getting

00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,580
included right I mean there is there is

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,920
now a lot of discussion on as the pack

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:06,330
you managed how are is going to be

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:08,550
deployed how are what constitutes a good

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,100
development workflow right because if at

00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,660
the end of the day in that conf is the

00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,940
steering committee if you will of

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,440
important things to worry about how does

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,830
the mass audience of the general

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,840
audience benefit from that so anybody

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,780
want to talk a few minutes about things

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,830
that have been discussed in that

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,660
and things that that you guys think are

00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:32,210
important to be discussed in net dev and

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:35,090
in the vast and more general Linux

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,350
community because we need to move some

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,110
of these things in some of the

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,540
directions that the Linux nobody is

00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,890
taking into a more structure itself and

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,570
I think there's general consensus on

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:49,580
that but what are the things for

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,140
audience members questions to ask him to

00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,850
think about and maybe participate in

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,860
here is what are the things you would

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:57,560
recommend these guys and the other

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,780
Netcom people in this room think about

00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,090
as things that Linux needs as

00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,860
infrastructure enhancements in the next

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:16,010
few years

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:20,830
come on I think description under the

00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,830
side is actually in that we always

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:29,740
without having thought about that before

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,830
anybody want to talk about like what are

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,080
the things that we should be thinking

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,330
about tools that you know we talked

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,560
about in IBM yesterday there's a few

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:48,500
other things that have been discussed

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,930
like how people are you talking about DC

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,760
maybe a validator but like how do we

00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:57,020
make that thing such that the vast

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:59,480
majority can engage with the sort of the

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,160
steering committee if you will and come

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,600
up with a better together answer then

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,490
maybe I can just encourage people to

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,440
write self tests and have these

00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,450
automatically run and week

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,460
at least in the DPF space we have lots

00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,750
of lease and they they catch tons of

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,670
bugs to the point where it'd be almost

00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,690
it's hard to imagine not having these

00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:22,970
tests at this point be quite nice if

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,220
other subsystems got to this point where

00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:26,630
where we cut bugs you know before things

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,070
are even applied at this point because

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:32,660
we everyone runs the self test before

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:36,800
they push matches so that's a great

00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:39,140
segue we'll do a quick audience check

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:43,610
how many people know about the BBF we

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,720
have self best infrastructure it's also

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,970
maybe important to note that it's a

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,880
month specific to me Jeff Jeff is one

00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,880
subfolder and all self tests directory

00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,450
the fine point might be lost so so I get

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,980
a statement here is go look at the self

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,790
test infrastructure and make sure that

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,290
you run it before you submit battles

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,620
they are usually run by a bunch of build

00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,210
BOTS

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,650
so if you do submit something and it

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,260
fails a self test we'll also hear about

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,370
it so and they actually are the other

00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,510
way is more important if somebody else

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,740
breaks your stuff then you have a self

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,740
test for it you'll touch it right away

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:28,670
you're talking about sort of topics and

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,530
so on it's pretty clear maybe not

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:36,290
surprised given that the program of this

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:38,720
event but xdp BPF is it's pretty hot so

00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,240
if we look at percentage of of

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,720
discussion at the net conf that was

00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,910
devoted to that topic it was significant

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,350
whereas if we go back a few years ago it

00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:52,760
was not really discussed at all that's

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,040
interesting and I guess in general

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,690
things to kind of come and go a little

00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:01,670
bit as the features come out before

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,290
working on them and then maybe to go

00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:06,090
away because they're completely

00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:07,350
maybe less applicable to the HDP case

00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:16,140
because it's kind of large and looks

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:18,570
like it'll go on for a while just yeah

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,250
so so the more PPF stuff I I found it

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,740
was like the learning curve but quite

00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,720
hard so I've actually put some Indians

00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:28,470
who make it easier for people to consume

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,360
and I'm actually it is the new hot topic

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,990
like user programmable networking we're

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,520
calling it

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,380
yeah and that actually means that you

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,660
should like actually learn this ppm

00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,670
stuff and figure out if it fits your use

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,440
case and if it doesn't fit it and you

00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,170
need it and tell us so we can actually

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,000
make it fit your use case it's a pretty

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,650
powerful feature and I've tried to put

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,110
some energy into making it more easy

00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,660
consumable by people and I hope like

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,990
this audience will will look into it and

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,690
try it out we've had the samples BPF and

00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,880
it's actually quite should be quite easy

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:03,679
now I had a check so if you have the

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:12,690
wrong compiler or even a final version I

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:14,670
would say easy as a very strong since

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:20,460
you're speaking EVP F I'm gonna pitch TC

00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:22,980
and so there is a RT soft s 4 t see this

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,480
this offers two opportunities for people

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,040
who are interested one is actually the

00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,410
great learning tools if you didn't know

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,559
what PDF and you go and looked at self

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,929
tests EULA is there's no documentation

00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,270
to describe what's in there the simple

00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:38,340
code snippets that you can learn a lot

00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,270
by just looking at the self test the

00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,220
other thing is it offers opportunities

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:44,690
for people who are not traditional

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,040
coders we I think we could use a great

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,600
the expertise of people want testers

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,910
right will know how to build good test

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,990
infrastructures that typically wouldn't

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:57,120
be contributing patches so participate

00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:59,010
at least you don't have to be a coder if

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,870
you're a tester in an organization

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,559
there's a great opportunity for you to

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,559
take part in this

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,520
any any conditions it's kind of obvious

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,320
I suppose but the tests of course

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,120
important because the complexity of

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,680
what's going on there is is so great

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,930
that as John said without the tests

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,400
it'll be very difficult to modify the

00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,820
code and add new features and so on

00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,500
without introducing regressions it is

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,890
very nice we have the the growing

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:32,110
coverage clinically but there are vast

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:38,620
areas that have almost no coverage at

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:40,450
all such tests are important to Google

00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,780
we have like six Android packet real

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:46,920
test so package is open source but the

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:50,320
test names are not yet upstream because

00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,930
we still have to make over the sis

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,840
controller for TCP namespace / namespace

00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:59,470
so it's mostly done now so as soon is

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:15,780
completed we can raise our packet just a

00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:18,130
neutral is it will reach because so

00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,320
question for the audience and maybe a

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,170
chance for the code for the audience to

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,470
ask a question

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,470
thank you say

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:39,400
cause automation for testing being a

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,810
topic so so a lot of those self tests

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,340
are automated already they've run with

00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:48,010
the build servers that run at night or

00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,980
something and we get reports on the

00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:52,150
mailing lists every once in a while so I

00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,830
think I think you think it's a self test

00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:59,170
is automated by multiple build servers

00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:00,730
at this point so to continue along the

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,550
question line let me just ask the

00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,710
question and maybe semi-continuous for

00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,470
the audience members I'm assuming a

00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,970
significant percentage here I would

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:14,320
classify themselves as developers come

00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,720
on there's got to be more hands than

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,270
that you're not paying attention okay so

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,620
if you are a developer what are the

00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:25,450
tools that you find hard to use easy to

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,610
use what was the thing that was a great

00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,590
experience for you what was the thing

00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:32,320
that was a terrible experience and I'll

00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:34,030
start this off by saying why I said

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,730
better rather than easy

00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:39,220
like you know six months ago if you

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,250
tried to write an EDF program and forget

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,720
offloading it just tried to write an EVP

00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:45,880
of program and you got something wrong

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,640
and you got like your validator just

00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,570
gave you some sorry this is wrong

00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,280
message and then you're like I don't

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:53,740
know what this is I'll figure it out

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:55,750
over the next six months maybe unless

00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,760
you really tore open the covers and

00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:01,180
started looking inside there are many

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,010
subsystems like that and sorry Jamal but

00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:09,490
DC still is in that spot where you get a

00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:11,200
email men and we need to go are there

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,560
tools like that that you guys find

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,270
frustrating problematic things that you

00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,190
understand the power of but you would

00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:22,380
like to see more I would like you to

00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:22,380
think about is back

00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:32,809
specifically because at E in ballerina

00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,700
limb thing is kind of frustrating for us

00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:38,359
too and that's why we got a TSN and

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,249
attributes X and X so now any subsystem

00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,489
can annotate an error return on a

00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:51,080
network message with some strange

00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:55,279
happens so I think we understand it at

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,959
some point and it was brought up a

00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,759
benign calm yes like wizard Eckhoff

00:32:56,959 --> 00:33:05,119
thing and then the actual implementation

00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:07,489
was done during that day that's exactly

00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,259
my point that's a good example like and

00:33:07,489 --> 00:33:10,309
this is the point of the audience is if

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:12,649
there are things like that that is

00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,389
frustrating to you but maybe there are

00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,729
other people who don't see it as a

00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:19,190
problem because they have learned over

00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:22,039
the years the magic incantation that

00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,599
gets it to work wind up bring that up

00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:26,779
here because hopefully then they have

00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:29,239
their next net conf somebody over here

00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:31,039
will be able to be an advocate and bring

00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:32,629
it up and say yeah no this is a real

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,379
problem we need to worry about it so

00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:35,379
looks like

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:51,549
but even making the project I'm working

00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:56,950
on I have something in addition to this

00:33:51,549 --> 00:34:01,510
where I things up to EMU an automated

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:04,840
way that gets an error codes user space

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:08,169
for things having something like this

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,089
that's sort of upstream and for the

00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:11,050
natural testing things really nice doing

00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:15,369
Harold

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:19,750
yesterday mentioned builder project for

00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:22,149
this but at least for me of my own

00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:24,990
development has been really useful for

00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:24,990
Pacific

00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:36,290
with digging in trying to find where

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:40,820
these error codes are raised frequently

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:45,829
I just like go old after where I think

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,950
it might happen I could stop at three

00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:53,990
okay now I do it this is horrible

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:56,899
sometimes ladies have traits you know

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:58,760
only call these you know that sort of

00:34:56,899 --> 00:35:01,670
works or it doesn't and the whole thing

00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:10,310
is just it seems like it should be

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:14,170
possible to actually trace where integer

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:14,170
comes from with the attorney loses call

00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:46,140
sounds like you're asking for a KGB

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,990
plug-in or something that has metadata

00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,400
on on the call stack and returns

00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:52,950
something you could definitely go look

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,360
at something without you and that's

00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,950
actually a very clever idea I mean if

00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,780
you have like a debug kernel you could

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:01,260
definitely say compile it in this mode

00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,740
and we combine it with K pros do a whole

00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:15,900
bunch of things and like the debugger be

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:21,990
able to extract an eternity yes that's a

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:24,000
good idea any anybody else nobody else

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,520
has any problems with Linux oh we have

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,360
one more problem with Linux kernel

00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,360
development so far

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,130
so I think what we see in a lot of

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,290
subsystems is what the networking is

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:41,320
that there is this visibility problem

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:44,200
like what do do where did I have package

00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,980
drop because some rule did imagine

00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,750
whatever so the first step of that was

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,750
creating to consume skp interface which

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,250
allows you to trace dropping because of

00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,360
an error versus dropping because we're

00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:57,640
simply done with the packet it we

00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,920
transmitted it properly and this goes

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,660
into the area of tracing and annotation

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,040
and adding trace point specific trace

00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,020
points to different subsystems and I

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,820
think there would be a lot of benefit to

00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,790
adding trace points to the IPSec layer

00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:13,060
and all the XRF codes so that is

00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:16,420
definitely a good point and I think if

00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,400
you create a set of reasonable initial

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,600
trades points that will solve like most

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,410
of the problems that you want it's you

00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,030
can at least isolate a system generate

00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,940
the packet training that generated a

00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:30,700
problem see all a policy match did it

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,380
failed here or this is the this is the

00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,589
point at which we fail to set the

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,969
security Association

00:38:34,589 --> 00:38:37,589
properly or whatever and you could

00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:39,450
actually start to diagnose the problem

00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:41,069
or sufficiently so that's a good point

00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,180
and we definitely do prove that across

00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:50,910
many of the parts of the network

00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:54,869
resources totally on that point useful

00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:57,380
thing for debugging kind of invisible

00:38:54,869 --> 00:39:00,839
errors that I'd like to see more of is

00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:05,460
tons of air counters it's so cheap to

00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:08,160
increment an unsigned long and if you

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,249
can keep dumping a bunch of counters and

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,219
watch which ones are changing it you

00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:15,960
build up the kind of intuition it's like

00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:19,170
before we had SSDs we could hear our

00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,729
hard drive moving like got this kind of

00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,710
feeling of what was happening in the

00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:24,960
computer and when you can see the air

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,339
counters changing you get this the same

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:32,130
kind of intuition about where things

00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:34,650
happen can I come into that thank you

00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:38,039
it's not it costs something to income

00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:40,950
encounters I mean the nanosecond area

00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,619
and especially if you want this counter

00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:45,479
to actually because if you right so you

00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,489
have to do atomic operations on it or

00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:48,690
you have to it won't be expensive to

00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,759
have accomplished for everything which

00:39:48,690 --> 00:40:08,549
is perceive you because that day okay

00:39:50,759 --> 00:40:09,960
love me I agreed the error cases would

00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:15,589
be good and I think we have

00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,589
already and many different never cases I

00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:26,010
totally agree and if you really want a

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:28,890
good example of what's possible I've

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:31,710
gotten dragged into this before the guys

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:35,010
we were very used to Cisco routers or

00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:37,050
FDI oh you can give you can give one

00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:39,720
command and said basically what happened

00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,700
to this and it goes doubts that walks

00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,400
through the whole stack telling you each

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,740
thing each firewall rule it evaluated

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,750
his word it had to be Landtag here's

00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,420
read this here's where it went through

00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,580
IPSec it gives you basically a

00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,000
walkthrough output of where your packet

00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:00,930
way and given that 90% of the things are

00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,970
human error that it's so valuable that

00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:05,640
everybody was dying for it and it was

00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:38,460
like ah the wordix tak doesn't have this

00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:40,920
is really hard to do just even for

00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,339
example right that just captures I think

00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,470
they did say that before just have any

00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:48,570
metadata just like I'm traversing this

00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,280
layer of yours in this layer and in the

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:52,530
debug case so you don't even have to put

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,790
it in the performance part before any

00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,790
jumps up and strangles me

00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:17,760
just no books if we fry in speed very

00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:28,289
good point

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:32,880
I do agree there is some issues with

00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:34,890
debugging mention you especially drop

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,349
counters all over the place but if you

00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:39,720
have some packets being dropped to some

00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:40,470
your way or something somewhere or

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,470
something

00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:47,250
there's no convenient counters it each

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:49,529
place in the flow it's easily to get the

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:52,319
reason you combine the chordal of this

00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:55,589
stuff so I do use some issue with

00:42:52,319 --> 00:43:02,910
debugging they need to be addressed need

00:42:55,589 --> 00:43:06,000
to be of course efficient okay we are

00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,650
almost out of time so from what I heard

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,690
there only four issues with the Linux

00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:12,089
kernel development right now and we

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,520
covered them all so if anybody wants to

00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:17,279
sneak in the fifth this is about as much

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:20,579
time as we have if not we will be

00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:23,010
wrapping up no fifth okay only four

00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:24,839
issues well ok then thank you very much

00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:29,039
gentlemen for being here if you have any

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:33,960
closing closing talks now would be a

00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:36,500
good time if not we'll start no closing

00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,500
across

00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:42,770
