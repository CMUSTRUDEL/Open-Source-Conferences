	00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:08,260
I work for Cisco and actually I am the

00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:12,190
tetration says the attraction is a kind

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:15,400
of solution to the data center

00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:17,560
visualizer solution actually eat the

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,010
gathering all the plot all the packet

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,820
and analyze dependency also a lots of

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:31,750
other things but the hill are we talking

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:34,300
about some the rock device maybe two

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:37,780
years ago we announced open and express

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:42,040
its kind of the operating system in the

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:45,610
rock device is open means actually this

00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:49,420
device about fully Linux feature the

00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:51,520
previously we have same name and access

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,039
the name of our operating system or

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,719
network device actually not that whole

00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,579
end up they talked about them the data

00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:02,440
center perspective network device

00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:05,560
operated by an express but the times we

00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,990
did not use Connor stack only you just

00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,659
paste Nestor

00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,979
so sort part application or auto

00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:17,470
application not easy to integrate with

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,960
the rock device but the two years ago we

00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,110
announced open and access means fully

00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,659
adapt the network picture it means

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:29,380
Connor stack and we developed the TOC

00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:34,500
device for specific hardware for the

00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:37,900
metals each winter so means and another

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,170
we provide some the software

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,619
installation management appear al p.m.

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,320
to actually young theta at this times

00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:49,920
only providing young but we provided

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,899
another SDK was on the way to packaging

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,630
third party application our custom build

00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:58,329
application in the land of sweets

00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:01,540
because the these from the Google of

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:05,560
Facebook they want to the network vendor

00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:09,069
just to give me a box I will develop my

00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,950
own software and hardware you ol box it

00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:14,239
means we providing kind of balloons box

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,910
with lots of interface

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,760
10-gig interface maybe for you at sixty

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,160
Tanguay interface with a linux or system

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,140
then they will develop their own custom

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,480
application even the routing or

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,360
switching application and they integrate

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,750
their data center the kind but one of

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,190
the trends of the Google or Facebook so

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:42,900
the company is Internet company demands

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:48,950
is Trentham moving to just give me a box

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:52,110
I will managing and using this product

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:56,660
so this kind of the open and it was a

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,940
kind of trend to beat a demanding of the

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,239
pet Cisco's customer as big customers

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,700
demand and the last thing is some

00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,970
support in container at this time is not

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,110
the toka container just a taxi we

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,380
support a taxi

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,069
so another container is we call the

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:20,400
guest shell and the Castel shell is

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,620
secure isolated container so sulphate

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,500
application can develop some software

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,650
all their custom DS in Casa shell and

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,940
learning their own purpose one loading

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:37,220
or switching protocol on Linux this is

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:42,000
the depend amento the open and express

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:46,230
yet there are some so this another way

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,829
to use this feature so same command used

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,299
in IP config IP or other command and the

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:57,389
customer current kind of the Google of

00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,609
it who wanted to leveraging log protocol

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:04,739
the face will use PGP internal BGP and

00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:09,450
means they wanted to learn their own

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:13,200
customized bgp protocol how to adopt

00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,480
this customer's demands on not open the

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,900
perspectives so we're providing some

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,489
gusty shell it means as the runtime

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,240
environment and the development

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:26,430
environment put your code in my network

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,560
speeds and

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:33,689
pro-europe reports this kind of approach

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,310
the PRF is kind of the isolation

00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:42,389
actually but to Linux the namespace yeah

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:45,560
as Europe is used vegetable used in the

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,270
network device to isolate isolate

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,360
loading or some other things actually

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,080
Breeden is kind of the logical isolation

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,409
but does not specify the routing does

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:03,509
now sells routing process but Europe is

00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:06,419
the isolation about routing and actually

00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:09,689
the same I process of lapping allowed be

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:14,069
aware up so the barrier is directly

00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:16,439
mapped to rings namespace and custom

00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:18,889
application using new socket is well

00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:21,090
integrated because it's just Allah knows

00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:23,759
where the space being the talk device

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:27,979
will that work device driver for cisco

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:35,940
built and AZ yeah it's a kind of Linux

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:38,479
this is architecture actually shows how

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,330
to leverage this feature actually maybe

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,960
not to benefit how to use this real

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,770
spots as means this networks switch as

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,770
your Dean sparks

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,889
[Music]

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:07,420
yeah actually we moved to the open

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:10,720
architects because we think to adopt the

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:13,780
kernel stack then we get more the

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,900
Certified Application to integrate and

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,050
we're providing some the customer

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,230
demands but it means what lose what what

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:29,980
group we use moving to the stack to kind

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:37,980
of stack comes these things about what

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:43,050
the cons yeah this is architecture nx-os

00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:46,380
this is the device actually hardware is

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,940
the nerve which has some you think maybe

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:55,690
two CPU it means one pole inter CPU just

00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,900
control the system in town and another

00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:03,400
thing is this cheap another easy using

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:06,610
poll data pooling this means is that the

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,130
reporting cisco build Cisco AZ we needed

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,760
to develop this kind of device driver

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:15,850
and integrate with the constant and

00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:20,170
solve Pat application or the we built

00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:23,620
our request application means same used

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:27,420
in Congo and same integrate with other

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:30,790
application so the customer can choose

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:35,950
not just an address I will use other

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:40,270
loading protocol as well to boarding we

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:47,890
can do and this time replace with my own

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:51,660
loading stay overloading protocol issues

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:57,910
from the born again she'll just a shell

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,950
yeah here's the I pull out actually this

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:04,360
box shows some typing off the name is

00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:08,979
some different it hits 1-1 it's just a

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,340
naming and it show only optton interface

00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:13,550
actually presented

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,300
plate down larvae interface but just up

00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,330
into paste

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:22,160
and another thing is the this kind of

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:25,400
peop she is internally used controlling

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,510
network device so it's not purposeful

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,910
the sulphate application the that other

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:39,529
purpose but only internal propose

00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:43,339
managing network device here is the the

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:47,570
liberal URL it means you can update or

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:50,240
get the another software package from

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:53,000
here and actually this is basic and as

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,670
well sleep oh there's a lot of the repo

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,820
you can download it based on Wind River

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:01,040
Linux distribution at this time is been

00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,180
there five version and next person

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,010
between based on windows 7 version and

00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:13,400
another caste shell based on the Center

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:16,550
7 sure it's on how to use the VR app and

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,190
namespace this comment is Linux actually

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,100
directs which commands configure

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:25,220
compilation terminal and create the Arab

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:31,490
context they're both this is the default

00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:33,980
gateway for devil's name space and the

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:40,360
adding eth1

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:46,070
to devil's name space you can shade and

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:50,529
you may be here after addressing is I

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:55,220
see the devil's name space and especial

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:58,670
IP net and as list then you get the

00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:02,779
created from the and address and this is

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:07,970
really stop the devil namespace and the

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:12,260
IP not an FCS CC doubles IPA means the

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,589
interface binding to devil's PRF Devils

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,710
namespace short interface

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:23,149
previously I put here

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:26,540
and you can see this interface we just

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:32,050
showed how to be a rep and use new space

00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:38,810
related creation create namespace on

00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:45,890
links and create Europe on annex ways as

00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:48,279
interchangeable this is cast shell it's

00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:52,880
the purpose that gets the shell is

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:55,010
actually some providing another party

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,649
application development environment and

00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,860
the excellent environments the third

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:05,450
party can build their own application

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,959
based on CentOS 7 and providing some

00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:12,050
additional package II from the same

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,209
architecture Linux central 7

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:18,589
distribution same package can install

00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:20,060
from here and use and learn this

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,930
environment but there are some

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:26,870
limitation about the the main purpose is

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:30,230
data hoarding and switching it's the

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:33,709
main purpose of the switch II but custom

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:37,910
application maybe exploit the people

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:40,670
power other things then the maybe some

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,550
service interrupted by caste shell so we

00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:48,230
have a limitation about CPU city and

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:50,870
memory and disk that we can computation

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:56,050
but there are some of the top limitation

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,050
about utilization in gas teacher

00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:04,060
this is just a shell in guest a shell is

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:08,820
a securely isolated so there's a kind of

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:12,760
tool to integrate with metal seeds and

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:18,130
caste shell one command is changing

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,880
wherever it means similar to IP net

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,769
earnest

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,290
exe C namespace but in gas tishell just

00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,360
changing wherever means using the

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:38,230
namespace of a management namespace and

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:40,540
the land is commands a same similar

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,360
management installed some software from

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:50,410
the caste teacher has already we used in

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:55,019
the little spots another thing is to

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:58,390
just show just the shell in accessing

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:04,660
the previous create namespace tables and

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:08,079
the show IP address this is a reversal

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,270
computers in an exploit to switch your

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,450
plate system and the show in gas station

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:17,160
because actually some application may be

00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,779
long on gas the shell means they want to

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,839
control all they want to get the

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,560
information prom the main service

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:28,600
traffic

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:33,220
peer network device for example maybe we

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:36,220
have some the flow visibility some the

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,870
how many packet transfer from one

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,290
interface to another physical interface

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:45,070
then the gas station should be accessed

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:47,940
this isolated namespace and get the

00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:50,820
information prom this deal trappy and

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:56,949
summarize and delivery some other

00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:59,470
relevant - oh we if we install angel who

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,910
are we installed popular shop for the

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,300
complication manage computation

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,839
perspective the operating steam maybe

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:10,830
think I wanted to managing Linux varrock

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,260
device similar to

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:18,160
then we deploy same tools ansible

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:22,180
or Papa shop result with same to

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,180
managing different device one polarock

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,940
device 1 polio server then the gas

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:34,600
nature could be used for management that

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:38,100
is per perspective this is just access

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:42,300
to lead and want to do something

00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,750
actually modify then using utility to

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,720
host-to-host

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,720
then actually learn the NFS commands

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:58,080
this is computation little spots and the

00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:01,470
two hosts actually learn this command in

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,470
an Express

00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,810
the construction is the the purpose what

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,750
I've been focused is to developing

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:16,029
customized application and install the

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:24,070
software application to managing network

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:28,000
device perspective it's kind of the

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:30,490
architecture about your analyst and your

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,230
sketch to show a separation securely

00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,360
separated build your own application and

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,720
communicate with an Express then

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:46,720
configure and get the made data from an

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:50,980
Express to an Express lot of thing is

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,910
the military means previously means this

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,630
server well in its box manage the via

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:02,050
current tools managing the imaging tool

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:06,100
but how to integrate over how to utilize

00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:11,199
my current monitoring tool to monitoring

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,240
network device this perspective the mood

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,970
ring to open a store is providing

00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:23,250
similar pros steam is to same to

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:27,130
managing network device Linux server and

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:30,910
another tool is some this kind of the

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:35,529
yeah in inspection well getting get the

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:38,920
data from the actually up flow here

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:41,699
isn't kind of the the top law we see the

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,550
all the flow from the guest OS and

00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:47,410
summarize and delivery to some cluster

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,010
means cross means them the gathering

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,459
data from the whole packet and hope law

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:57,790
and analyzed this is done it could be

00:16:54,459 --> 00:17:00,220
done in network device without other

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,850
software although photo motion and a

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,679
another another box we just develop

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,839
software and deploying left ox ox which

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,809
then this looks like kind of server and

00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,689
get the data from the the all the

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,880
traffic between was to peer to network

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:22,410
seeds get information

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,410
utilize these tools

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,150
actually this is maybe not maybe not

00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,370
coming with you because it's a kind of

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,470
the management perspective the

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:40,529
previously we have simple error

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:43,440
management protocol as managing but

00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:54,330
mainly used for monitoring Network

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:58,309
device it says SNMP and SNMP is old LP

00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:03,179
and there is a lateral requires or that

00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:06,380
demands to were effectively control and

00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:11,929
managing the talk device so another

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:17,100
management protocol that comp came out

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:21,750
we want to resolve to the people of the

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,960
SNMP and we introduce how to managing a

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,809
lot of device network device and

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:32,090
effectively configuration and lots of

00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:34,440
other things so neutral is lack hump

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:39,539
welcomed providing first approach is

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:42,679
prevent paste the previous in SNMP has a

00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:47,429
kind of the API but as not well defined

00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:50,960
so another management protocol should be

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:55,220
providing the programmatic interface and

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,419
another thing is the long time data and

00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,990
compression data there is need to

00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:03,419
separation between runtime data and

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,669
completion data maybe it means we

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,659
configure that we interface in the

00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,390
compression file

00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:11,909
it's kind of compression data but we

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,720
gathering ARP table or others runtime

00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:17,429
data if we need to differentiate because

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,470
sometimes we wanted to get the only

00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,990
operation data actually on time data

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,960
it's not configured it's automatically

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:27,840
discovered and generated in the learning

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,220
that device addressing is computation so

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:35,330
we need to separation completion and the

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,330
runtime state data

00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:45,530
another thing is to not not specific the

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:49,550
device we want to configure enable us to

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:52,730
develop a service the SNMP actually does

00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:55,970
not have capability to configure network

00:19:52,730 --> 00:20:01,310
device but normally just to get the data

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:03,920
from the device is poetry and but here

00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:07,310
another protocol wanted to compute our

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,520
kind of a service it means not not one

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,680
barak device kind of the street or

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,500
device we have to configure the

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:21,980
perspective is kind of service and

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,020
another thing is the the computation

00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,590
checking and recovery

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:30,310
it means similar to database two-phase

00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:33,310
commit protocol virtual database has a

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:37,000
skilled sum command of dating or

00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:40,460
actually of their own deleting and then

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,540
last comment is of the comet this the

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,620
delete affected to real database but

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,760
previous command

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:52,280
just put the command is on the fly just

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,060
affected some the state worsen database

00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:58,940
there is no meaning of comedy so the

00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,970
camp provide there is another capability

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,160
check the commit it means if the

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,190
computation I put computation was called

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:10,690
API other things and I found it's wrong

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:13,670
then we need to roll their welcome in

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:16,130
the previous lesson the way actually

00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,640
this computation maybe is not the bad

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,680
way

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,330
the IP address used put the IP address

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,360
then is up to command

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:29,080
Lytton immediately affected the device

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:33,970
but this one to do some isolation about

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,970
computation and commit or over

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:45,340
this is a kind of the means though that

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:49,630
comp let's come see our PC Google RPG is

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:55,400
management protocol to management tool

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:58,370
this is another modeling how to model

00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,790
metal device that your network device a

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:04,430
lot of the benders the means their own

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:10,640
their space big compilation actually

00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:15,650
Cisco has the well-defined the data so

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,470
other another company means that the apt

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:20,780
or Cisco it's the similar data structure

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,820
similar command of the Cisco but

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:28,310
actually they want to develop another

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,110
feature or external feature then there

00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:32,300
is a new comments that when you they

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,710
remove their how to describing these or

00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:40,550
get the data it means they want to say

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:43,940
ok we want to mike made another data

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:46,130
model if we have data model then we

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,220
easily get the data how to configure how

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:54,950
to get data from the device similar to

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:59,900
XML schema XML schema define how XML

00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:03,800
documents will describe if we see the

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:07,430
schema then we can say this document has

00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:11,120
converted the XML schema or not and how

00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:14,270
to use and what the element should be a

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,730
fear or not same similar meaning is

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:20,300
theorem young dear amore young poor

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,690
network I understood why use another

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:27,380
young its example baby enough but

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:32,030
network vendors and other group develop

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:35,210
new data model young we show some the

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:37,340
how the young is describing and there

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:41,630
are some to type of data can creation

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,760
and operation in compression means some

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,660
data I can computer but operation data

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:52,940
is gathering from the in operation state

00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:55,910
is ARP table or from the routing table

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,799
this means operation area and there are

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:01,730
some the vendor specific or a standard

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:04,010
item poor operation specific operation

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:13,760
standard computations vespi compression

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:15,919
standard actually Jung has three meaning

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,289
a young means from the kind of abuddin

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,200
language similar to XML schema how to

00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:24,309
describe Murdoch device feature or

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:29,419
narrow device capability within young

00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:32,510
and another meaning centerra Morin it

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:35,809
means what the data structure the actual

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,929
in data was dependency not dependency

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:40,760
the architect actually architecture

00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:43,700
organization of data in Stata tera Maria

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:47,659
and unseasoned device data

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:52,159
it means block device has young mobile

00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:57,130
then the device give us what management

00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:03,710
software to network data device data

00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:07,880
looks like this this is the kind of

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:13,100
young one young 2py young just to show

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:16,610
this is a hierarchy and here is the bosu

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:19,820
lane IETF interface is a standard Ian I

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:24,049
taped the pint we describe interface

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:27,770
like this and there are interfaces it

00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:29,929
means there's not single interface there

00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,710
are a lot of interface then kind of list

00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:40,090
we describe list interface and interface

00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:44,870
heads key name and another attribute

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:46,270
name description type enabled other

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,900
things

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:53,600
the data is can be interchangeable means

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:57,159
XML schema or some this architecture

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,810
singular but describing this way and

00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:05,260
young use

00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:08,660
the mini container and released and leap

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:13,540
necklace terminal element does not

00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:18,430
containing other children dolls and

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:22,850
least a kind of the elements have

00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:26,810
children's and it's the key and value

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:33,790
actually the type of value D is modeling

00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:33,790
just type string type and name his name

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,590
data type is defined in ITF and

00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,160
vendor-specific also defined their own

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:49,550
they are tied it depends on what the

00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:59,240
feature or what the capability provided

00:26:49,550 --> 00:27:04,340
by the bender XML actually young young

00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:09,380
mother can transform to XML there's a

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:13,280
well-defined to too young to XML XML

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:18,410
means this is namespace at some Alain

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:21,950
space this is a dentist's name and at

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:25,190
instant interfaces easy and a lot of

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:30,920
interface here and pace and we eat

00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:36,710
easily expect 9 element and tie tie

00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:40,340
means kind of the string yep tie and

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:44,350
enable the kind of value through apples

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,350
this is changed to XML

00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:51,870
you must leap previously on Moodle has

00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:58,590
leap is another element without children

00:27:51,870 --> 00:28:02,510
and another list is the interface is

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:06,780
container container hands or children's

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:10,200
so this is the buidling Network divides

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:14,100
capability and they're all device that

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:17,190
the data what data can get from network

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:20,460
device and put to network device just to

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,640
describe in young and commercialized

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,670
tool opens us to get the young they

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,970
understanding how to configure little

00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:36,150
device and what data can get from this

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:39,930
device and the type is defined in same

00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:42,710
young that means same type date data

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:46,290
about different name or different data

00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:49,260
different same data name for different

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:52,320
type the tool understanding the young

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:57,030
and identify the capability of varrock

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,490
device and easy to interface with device

00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:04,670
and the management to this is purpose

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:08,970
how we develop the young and this day

00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:11,850
young is popular used popular in and a

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,000
probably it means an app really means

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:18,030
there are some kind of the neck function

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,070
but is fundamentally virtual they want

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:22,350
to deploy in cloud or some

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:25,530
virtualization environment and they want

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,770
to leave agile to deploying this virtual

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,870
appliance with a specific purpose that

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,060
times the understanding okay we love

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:36,450
this young we get a young from the walls

00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:39,090
Olympian app and then we put the some

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,340
value from the young it's the meaning of

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:44,910
the IP address its meaning of the center

00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:45,480
function and then deploy easily and a

00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,800
poppy

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:54,120
so telco company kind of decay in Korea

00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,310
clitoris Katie heavenly depends on the

00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,550
rock device orchestration in young

00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,550
Buddha

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:07,450
we understand sin can be young

00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:09,960
what is young and why is leaves for

00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,700
describing the rock device the device

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,840
capability and then we introduce that

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:20,309
come for call the control is kind of the

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:25,299
Alpesh protocol the payload is XML and

00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:28,479
the XML the element schema is similar to

00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:31,899
the previous young Moodle but the XML

00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:41,429
schema has that the same not actually

00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:45,909
not the same but similar to basically

00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:49,239
the deccan protocol using SSH secure

00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:52,629
shell and al peace message alpha silly

00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:55,960
classed and apply and there are some the

00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:58,649
operation means get just lead actually

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:02,590
get to compete just get the computation

00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:05,919
and I did compete wanted to modify the

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:09,700
configuration get operation means just

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:15,039
the operation data and content is the

00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:17,590
XML data payload it looks like this if

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,109
you want to using cap information for

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,119
learning computation that get it's

00:31:20,109 --> 00:31:24,099
learning computation it means not the

00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,649
conversion data it's automatically

00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:30,549
gathering from the traffic the at the

00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:33,129
table or loading table is that prom get

00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:35,950
operation and get complete it's a

00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:37,989
compression we put the IP address speed

00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,210
and the description and name its

00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:44,200
interface it's kind of a configuration

00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:48,330
data we get this data from get compete a

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:52,450
diff config is what to do modify delete

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:55,269
other things to the completion data the

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,399
copy compete until it can pick is very

00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:00,940
specific in the rotavirus lot of device

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:03,580
has kind of a state normally two states

00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,830
one is the running state and another is

00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,739
the start of state it means learning

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,630
state is boot on the rock device using

00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:13,570
the word compilation in the memory

00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:16,090
it means memory means is Palatine the

00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:19,330
starter computation is permanent storage

00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:22,900
save the configuration and every time

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:25,660
there of device boot up using the

00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:28,419
starter configuration and getting all

00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:32,260
data in learning computation another

00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:35,500
thing is the black camp used to commit

00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,630
it means some the roleplay welcome it

00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,080
means there are some the another way to

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:45,610
not immediately applied all the command

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:50,309
up to checking validating and commit

00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:53,110
well over so another one can't

00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:56,559
computation is candidate computer or

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,620
some the nut resistant but not learning

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:03,220
computation is kinda complete in the

00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:06,390
comp context and that some lot or not

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,450
means a kind of locking in database we

00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:12,669
called people updating some low we have

00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,669
to lock the lock code world table or

00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:18,400
some other granularity but same similar

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:22,179
conserve is when you're updating in case

00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:28,659
of edit computation then we can lock the

00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:31,659
compression and update this is some

00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:34,630
simple code via Python within the camp

00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:38,350
code actually some the libraries

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:41,380
imported from the Python and specify

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,620
what device were put and what user and

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,620
password

00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:55,400
the companies are the packaging actually

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:58,260
the previously you import here

00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:02,130
Nancy Klein Beckham client important

00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:06,090
manager and connect host port user and

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,490
password and this is using SSH so there

00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:11,910
are some the host key check verify or

00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:13,680
not and another thing is device

00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:16,200
parameter to what device you want

00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,900
connect because and there is a lot of a

00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,170
network device means there is a lots of

00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:24,860
vendors developing that device and there

00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,770
are some specific vendor specific

00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:31,380
nakum attribute so we're going to say

00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:33,510
specify what device is kind of land

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:38,280
access ways were kind of juniper chinos

00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:42,150
who are some another iOS Excel and this

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,450
is configuration and then connecting and

00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:50,660
this is just some Pinto I wanted to see

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,660
only hostname and presume the means

00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:00,570
you can specify the fight over some just

00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:08,070
a stream it's enough means hostname and

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:13,350
burden and then you get to reply just to

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:15,930
change the XML just parsing XML and some

00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:21,230
of the external data LPC reply contains

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:23,730
data and native and hostname it means

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:28,140
just like this

00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:31,980
a cannibal response from the XML that's

00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:36,900
just animal data and the data element

00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:40,400
contains this item this is Cisco IOS

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,960
exceed native and person and hosting

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:50,130
this is simple how to use the comp and

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:54,690
that comes just using the payload as XML

00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:58,020
the XML data is defined poor vendors

00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:01,620
best people so how to get this data is

00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:04,710
very questionable in interest first time

00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:08,310
you want to use neck comp then how to

00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:10,860
get prominent welcome message the

00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:14,330
template when I change the computation

00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:20,130
will get the data so the network device

00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:24,390
has some capability to changing all the

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:26,880
information to XML it means analyst has

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,440
a kind of command command Mindy show the

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,250
running data show the comparison data

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:37,320
and pipeline XML then this change it

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:39,930
looks translate XML format then the tool

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,600
well some people understand ok when I

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:45,090
get to some the interface brief then

00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:48,420
this format of external data will pass

00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:51,000
to prom dialog device to management

00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:55,500
software so understanding what element I

00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,850
want to interest and I used how to the

00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,490
architecture of the documents another

00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:05,280
thing is the hot configure actually

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,930
added configuration then what payload I

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,200
have to put

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:15,539
- Network device tells another utility

00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:18,450
XML in then the compete prepared how to

00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:24,990
generate XML data poor computation not

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:28,670
to get the completion here I want to

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:32,430
configure hostname changing this then

00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:36,170
this documents actually the data payload

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:41,010
of the comp generated I want to change

00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:43,470
here the value actually I wanted to

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:46,109
change in host name the name of switch

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:50,369
and I put the name of switch Berryhill

00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:52,589
and the whole data could using the come

00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,500
protocol then the rock device understand

00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:58,829
and the changing hostname this is the

00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:02,549
XML data is not easy understand actually

00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:05,609
not get hold the promoter of the XML so

00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:09,299
the answer is providing two commands

00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:12,510
pipeline XML and XML in to generate data

00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:17,000
to manipulate with a management tool or

00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:17,000
some other code

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,260
lastly is kind of the deck hump and left

00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:30,800
camp yeah we mean left already knows the

00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,470
similar to HTTP protocol yeah we adopt

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,860
HTTP protocol same functionality in the

00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:39,400
camp

00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:39,400
but just to adopt Blessed API is feature

00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:54,700
but very easily here yeah nest comp only

00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:58,270
used HTTP method get post could patch or

00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:02,550
delete and it's the corresponding the

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:05,500
come command get sames get and get comp

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:09,220
post may be added computer actually this

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:15,040
is updating data to means all edit

00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:18,690
compete this is here is the less comp

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:26,140
command and that comp operation are

00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:30,730
mapped like this and payload previous in

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:34,780
the comp only XML data but the last comp

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:38,560
at last mostly used adjacent not XML

00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,620
yeah it can use XML but this day most of

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,190
JSON API last ap I use Jason time so

00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:48,390
there's two contents payload type one

00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:48,390
part ml 1 / TC

00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:58,090
and another thing then how I get the API

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,050
endpoints actually API endpoint is

00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:08,080
address of the network device and what

00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:12,660
data I pass to and what the path I have

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:17,380
to specify for what operation forget or

00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:20,080
update here means this is IP address

00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:23,560
management IP address of the device and

00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,670
loot is a last company cast normally

00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:30,010
duty is API and their store is destroyed

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,980
learning comprehension who are running

00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,710
overcome actually get the learning data

00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,700
it's just the learning and update

00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:42,850
computation that computation and this is

00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:46,120
Jung Basel and container the previously

00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:48,580
I showed young about pre-plea and there

00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:54,910
are concepts of module container and

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:58,250
leap this is module aim and this is

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:02,120
container and leave what means with

00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:07,790
what they should be changed or I'll get

00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:11,690
a similar to conserve of last and there

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:14,410
are some other options for example you

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:18,550
can see the net of death management and

00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:22,940
API we want to get the running data and

00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:26,090
interfaces as Muslim interface kind of a

00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:30,590
container name and leap the interface

00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:32,870
actually has key than of the name then

00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:36,080
the interface name is key so this

00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:39,800
interest name and the deep means detail

00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:42,140
information of these elements so we get

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,220
the data from it with some the

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,540
architecture hierarchy of data

00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:51,640
interfaces interface

00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:54,710
this means key and type of string and

00:41:51,640 --> 00:42:00,380
description type neighborhood was model

00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:04,640
data we can specify this API then we

00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,920
update or get the data here left comp

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,380
maybe last comp is more easily

00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:15,530
understood because if not device

00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:19,750
providing this young then we get to how

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:24,710
I call or how makes on the API call weed

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:26,810
young the previously that comp is XML

00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:30,020
data we needed to understand how to XML

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:33,500
format generate and when I the caster

00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:37,370
than what the XML opponent get from the

00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:42,140
network device we utilize XML in oil XML

00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:45,980
but in last quest comp the yarn specify

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:49,160
and the young tailed the hierarchy of

00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:53,390
documents how we how it is organized so

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:55,930
easy to understand and is to call based

00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,930
on the arm

00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:14,900
yeah this isn't the uproot Our Blessed

00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:18,410
come live well I actually I delivered it

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:23,780
about opening a phrase this short time

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:27,620
but I said the analysis Cisco's the

00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:31,700
octopods open system but adopt means

00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:34,990
picture and open means adopting Linux

00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:38,180
and providing some salty party or

00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:41,120
custom-built application run time it

00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:44,930
means the management perspective or some

00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:47,930
other interesting job done in network

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,150
device not separate server we do not

00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:52,610
require on a separate server on the lawn

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:55,150
in the land of produce device there's an

00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,150
SDK

00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:04,010
there is SDK developing this software

00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:06,830
application based on central 7 container

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:10,000
or a3 container you build your own

00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:13,700
application and learning the news box

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,120
that isn't easily testing we provided

00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:20,060
sandbox actually developer site is kind

00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,600
of the Cisco's the environments to how

00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,760
to develop software on Cisco device

00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:29,060
server networks model things and this

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,700
standard box is a longtime instance the

00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:35,240
demo was on the longtime instance easily

00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:39,950
connect and to see the computation over

00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:43,430
some kind of did some sass trial bottom

00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:45,460
it means each device and there's some

00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:49,640
another thing is the virtual appliance

00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:52,490
we sell physical metal fridge and we

00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:56,500
provide same open system but learning

00:44:52,490 --> 00:45:02,240
your virtual box or premiere fusion ESX

00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:05,420
in KVM so you get to some teeth patrol

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,690
imagery and you can easily testing young

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,330
your last composite ease and if we set

00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,730
up the virtual

00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:14,880
pathways then you can see this developer

00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:17,970
sandbox

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,410
Center box inside the rock device looks

00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:25,380
like this you can easily API young XML

00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:27,720
and annex API basically testing

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:30,230
management perspective this world's poor

00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:33,779
narrow device and testing latest

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:36,660
response and you understand okay I will

00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:42,779
program managing this network device

00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:47,160
beer developer sandbox okay this is what

00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:51,109
I prepared for my session and a question

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:55,470
actually is maybe most of the guys not

00:45:51,109 --> 00:46:00,930
expected what I presented here you will

00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:03,329
you know maybe some kind of the

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:08,180
difference between I want to show some

00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:11,160
the lean of one and to show some the my

00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:14,390
link feature on the device and how to

00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:18,980
management but maybe you expect more

00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:18,980
deeper in little networking

00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:39,300
rest comport do any of your github

00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:42,620
open-source things include the rest come

00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:49,830
for Netcom servers or are those

00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:53,610
proprietary open source project indeed

00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:58,170
here is one of the github system that

00:46:53,610 --> 00:47:01,460
Deb and asked SDK and here you visit

00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:04,350
then let ever sandbox it's kind of the

00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:07,050
long tiny environment you connect

00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:11,190
remotely and the testing you means an

00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:14,090
accomplice conserva this one you want to

00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,090
try okay

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,250
first of all thank you for your

00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:32,300
presentation

00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:35,210
yeah I I heard I thought this case

00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:39,860
really good for the completing the MPD

00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:42,320
dual switch were louder but in a real

00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:45,290
environment you need to orchestrating

00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,420
the configuration of all the switches

00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:53,470
and louder's is there any way or Israel

00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:59,240
of a source for that yes it could have

00:47:53,470 --> 00:48:01,580
occasion to for the huge directive as

00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,280
management to have one per

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:08,060
commercialized version and another thing

00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:09,920
is the the open source management to the

00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,500
originally see the open source means

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,650
ignite a kind of an exercise management

00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,130
tool that has put the computation POA P

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:21,770
and allows put the data from to

00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:24,620
telemetry data of the deans and NSO

00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:26,510
network service Orchestrator is a

00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:30,050
commercialized software to managing

00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:32,440
owner of device beer young and the

00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,440
country

00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:44,130
so so all of this you know all of this

00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:46,920
is great for like doing an orchestrating

00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:49,320
configurations modifying some Reb

00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,840
information are you guys thinking of

00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,450
kind of like taking it one step further

00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:58,380
and possibly trying to do something with

00:48:54,450 --> 00:49:00,450
like switch dev or si I before so that

00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,370
people can actually start developing

00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:05,700
their own you know data plate

00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:15,930
applications so that people can actually

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:21,330
start doing things with the a6 I didn't

00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:24,240
catch the URL is there any is there any

00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:28,800
intent to start bringing certain like

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,930
api's like smudge dev or like si I so

00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,570
that people who are that's a developing

00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:36,540
their own routing protocols could start

00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:39,620
developing them for the nx-os platform

00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:43,470
they need to do certain custom things

00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:46,700
you mean something their own routing

00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:51,500
protocol in an actress yes if some

00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:55,950
outside of what Sisk is offering like if

00:49:51,500 --> 00:50:02,010
in access also has some the contribution

00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:04,920
about the contribution about actually

00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:07,740
the developing environments but the open

00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,390
community what I learned from my

00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:13,680
customer they looking for

00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:16,490
Kouga is l2 l3 switching the open source

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:20,250
project and they wanted to using that

00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:23,730
the protocol in and access they wanted

00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:27,750
to try to learn the Kouga because they

00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:30,410
have their own management scheme and an

00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,790
address maybe it has none beat the tell

00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,910
requirements they wanted to adopt a new

00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:38,540
protocol and they wanted to managing so

00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:41,520
cisco doesn't and maybe not actively

00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:44,100
involve or encourage the short part

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:47,790
application but it depends on what

00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:50,520
customer needs ok we have advanced

00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:54,180
service team and we have

00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,980
some the consulting the Dro so we

00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:59,850
understand in customer commands and that

00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:02,340
we get involved with developing some

00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:05,310
code or some of the product delivery but

00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:07,560
the not specific requirements on a

00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:13,620
specific intent from the customer maybe

00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:16,080
we didn't engage to open and from extra

00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:18,750
outing protocol maybe we focused in our

00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:22,470
products our protein our core and where

00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:27,630
I will invest our feature yeah it's the

00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:31,070
answer for you okay thank you

00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:31,070
any questions

00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:43,809
Hey yep I would like to run my own Linux

00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:45,790
distribution on a switch without the

00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:49,119
nx-os at all

00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:55,300
is it possible will it be possible and

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:58,030
one contribute to your Linux without and

00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:01,240
afterwards yes I don't want it some

00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:03,040
binary think I just want my what I'm

00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:06,339
used to do non servers

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,430
I want the same thing on switches so is

00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:14,109
it possible will it be possible actually

00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:16,540
it possible means you want to your own

00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:19,000
lives distribution on an express

00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:21,430
actually the non-tariff is actually the

00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,069
nirach device means the danger Nexus

00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:26,650
which you replace operating system you

00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:34,109
know on us things a usual distribution

00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:34,109
is good you can you can you can do that

00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:44,140
for Isaac library plays it everything

00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:48,690
means to talk device device driver kind

00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:52,630
of I will Chuck I understand I

00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:55,030
understand this is possible we are some

00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:59,410
kind of contract for Cisco and the

00:52:55,030 --> 00:53:02,380
customer but basically this code also

00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:08,440
may be open because we adapted Linux so

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:11,829
I will check and reply to you I I guess

00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:14,349
I got it so open Nexus has been out for

00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:19,540
a couple of years how much adoption are

00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:22,540
you seeing by customers next was it's

00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:27,160
just three years ago has opened the open

00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:32,890
interest and actually I not the adoption

00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:35,920
rate but this day we providing cloud

00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:38,559
scale that works it's a test which has

00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,740
the Lebanese all the pizza do we have to

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:45,910
deploy this open address so there is a

00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:48,980
number of reporter named 7.30

00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:56,090
bose-einstein princely is all or

00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:58,430
from there first so our customers asking

00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:02,660
for open Nexus and actively deploying it

00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:05,710
outside of a lab my understanding is as

00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:09,490
I know that us on Facebook and Google

00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:12,740
asking to his future opening address but

00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:15,680
normal enterprise actually a snotty cast

00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:18,410
this kind of return they just used an

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:27,609
Express even they deploy open interest

00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:32,680
just to using a nice feature is always

00:54:27,609 --> 00:54:32,680
is all licenses attached

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,660
actually not maybe I don't know actually

00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:45,280

00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:47,700
at you or not but based on yeah I needed

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,700
