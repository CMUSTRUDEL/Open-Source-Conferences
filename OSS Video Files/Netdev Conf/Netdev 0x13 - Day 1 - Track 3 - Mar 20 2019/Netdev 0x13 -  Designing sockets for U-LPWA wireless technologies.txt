Title: Netdev 0x13 -  Designing sockets for U-LPWA wireless technologies
Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 1 - Track 3 - Mar 20 2019
Description: 
	Andreas FÃ¤rber created a design to bring LoRa PHY sockets
into the Linux kernel, with LoRaWAN MAC layered on top.
As he interacted with other LPWA or WPA network technologies
stake holders it was natural for more discussions
to surface.

This talk gives an update on where the discussions
have gone for LoRa, FSK, etc., with focus on netlink
layer, protocol families and socket addresses.
