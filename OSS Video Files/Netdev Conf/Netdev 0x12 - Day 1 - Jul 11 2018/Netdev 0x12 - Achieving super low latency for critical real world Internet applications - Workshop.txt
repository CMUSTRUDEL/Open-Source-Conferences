Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 1 - Jul 11 2018
Description: 
	Tom Herbert chaired a session which went into requirements for achieving super
low latency for critical real world Internet applications.

Field applications and IoT require low latency (we are talking Sub 10 msecs),
high throughput and secure, and highly reliable communications.  Think traffic
intersection monitoring, remote surgery, industrial robotics, etc.  How do we
get there on Linux?

He attempted to motivate the discussion with a live physical demo of traffic
intersection using a slot car track.
