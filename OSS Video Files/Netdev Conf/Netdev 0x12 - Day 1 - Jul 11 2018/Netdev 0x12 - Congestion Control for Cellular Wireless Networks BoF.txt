Title: Netdev 0x12 - Congestion Control for Cellular Wireless Networks BoF
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 1 - Jul 11 2018
Description: 
	Hari Balakrishnan chaired a BoF discussion at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal on July
11th, 2018 to help formalize the constraints of the problem and ways in which
the community should evaluate congestion control protocols for cellular
networks.

Cellular networks exhibit significant variations in bottleneck link rates even
over short time durations. AQM techniques like fq-codel with ECN feedback are
insufficient.

It is challenging to properly evaluate congestion control approaches over
cellular network paths; it gets difficult when it involves in-network
mechanisms since it is not easy to deploy a test network running new
network-layer mechanisms in such setups.

This BOF put forward an evaluation technique involving collection of real-world
cellular network traces and then replayed them on Linux based infrastructure.
The Mahimahi toolset facilitates such a setup utilizing Linux containers.
This approach allows for experimenting and validating newly coded algorithms on
Linux in an accurate environment.

To kick things off in this BoF and frame future discussions, Hari illustrated
how to use collected traces and evaluated the Accel-Brake Control (ABC)
approach using the Mahimahi toolset.
