okay so what's the on time then that is

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,220
being set up I'm gonna increase DJ DJ is

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:26,310
the director of network architecture and

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,070
security at verizon just to give you an

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,200
impact of this verizon is a sec second

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,140
largest provider in the world after

00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,140
china mobile you think of china mobile

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,530
the big monopoly in china 500 or more

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:48,390
million subscribers brazzers the second

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:51,240
in the world so they are using linux DJ

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,620
for some time okay he has already paid

00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,600
for his sins so he doesn't do a lot of

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,860
coding but occasionally he's not to get

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:09,689
angry and start coding i'm just going to

00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:13,590
hand it over to him okay so why does i

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,440
just chose a very simplistic topic it's

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:19,050
not as technical heavy where's the

00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:25,290
previous talks I'm just going to frame

00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:29,430
up why we are so inclined to get to a

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,530
Linux way of doing things we have been

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,770
doing a lot of things outside of Linux

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,930
for longest time and some of us within

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,920
verizon we believe that Linux way of

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,900
doing things has a lot of advantages to

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,040
give you some idea about the growth of

00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:51,110
the network traffic if you look at the

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,810
latest vni document published by Cisco

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:58,890
they claim that by 2020 there is going

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:03,560
to be 2.3 zettabytes of data that will

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:08,670
be traversing the internet and between

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:12,840
2005 and 2020 that's apparently about a

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,230
hundred times growth and it's the last

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,540
twenty two percent comes between 2015

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,090
and 2020 and so this is how

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,799
the data is growing at a rapid pace I

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,590
mean for all the people that actually

00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:30,310
take small videos and share with one

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,730
another all of that stuff actually has

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:37,870
an impact on the network traffic acid

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:41,379
happens in the internet and we see quite

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:46,209
a bit of the growth combine that with

00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:48,370
the the reduction of awkward as they

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:51,489
would call it because a lot of services

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,750
these days are going out for free and if

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:58,239
everybody wants everything for free the

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:01,450
transit bite must carry the lowest cost

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,239
otherwise for 2.3 zettabytes I can't

00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,700
build network big enough to handle that

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,489
kind of traffic so you constantly have

00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:13,090
to figure out what is the best way to

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,970
reduce costs and increase efficiency to

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,730
deliver the network traffic it's not

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,700
just the network traffic we also had to

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,439
figure out that the size of Verizon how

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,169
do you keep the lights on how do you

00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:31,359
keep the bills paid how do you keep the

00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:34,510
business going when the it's there's a

00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:38,049
constant commoditization of the stuff

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:41,409
that you're selling so it naturally

00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:45,150
lends people to go and look at what is

00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:49,479
the best way to innovate and deliver

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,139
services and applications so that you

00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,900
can actually stand the curve of the

00:03:52,139 --> 00:04:00,790
declining pricing power with the

00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:08,769
increasing traffic patterns so with that

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:10,780
said I just wanted to I just put a

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,290
couple of life together if I can make

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,290
this work somehow

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:35,050
this page done you so this is a pretty

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,520
much saying what I just said so this is

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,580
the absolute requirement that we

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,110
currently have and what do we have to

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:47,020
use to solve some of these problems and

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:50,770
when we looked at the innovation curve

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,419
as other people up to the northwest the

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,680
United States I've also figured out it

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:59,460
looks like that if you don't adapt the

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,539
pace of innovation that happens in Linux

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,930
sooner or later you're going to get left

00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:07,419
behind there's a lot of people working a

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:11,560
lot of hours and a lot of them are

00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:14,349
working in fact in their spare time in a

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,220
basement somewhere and they are never

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:20,080
being on a constant basis and you cannot

00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,940
ignore the fact that the number of

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,400
people that are putting time and effort

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,460
into these activities is quite

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,729
significant and the innovation as you

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,210
have seen in the previous speakers the

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,560
innovation is actually happening on

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,199
linux and especially the networking

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,169
layer and the linux every day every week

00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,419
and if you don't take advantage of that

00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,750
it's going to be almost impossible to

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:52,479
actually still stay the curve that i was

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:54,310
mentioning before and if you look at at

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,370
the network operating systems that exist

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,199
today I think Linux actually by four

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,860
beats almost anything else out there I

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,599
mean the enterprise market hasn't caught

00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,940
up yet but if you look at all the data

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,620
center markets and everybody else they

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,150
have figured out the value of Linux in

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,400
the space and there is no question about

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,690
it sooner or later everybody is going to

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,139
come to that same conclusion and combine

00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,389
this with of the the operations that one

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,249
has to run when you have thousands of

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,019
servers star

00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:30,899
switches its you had to automate it as

00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:33,329
much as possible you cannot use the same

00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,579
old as somebody goes and types logs into

00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:38,099
a machine and the stuff that doesn't

00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,409
work anymore as well have figured out

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:44,089
that it has to be fully automated if it

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:46,589
has to stand the test of time because

00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:49,559
nobody can log in two thousand servers

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,569
in the night so the what we used to know

00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:53,819
as a one-night process because we used

00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,189
to have to machine sitting in a room so

00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,409
whenever there was an upgrade that used

00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,389
to be done as a one-night process or

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,999
somebody does something in a night they

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,419
switch over they reboot the box the load

00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:08,189
video that stuff cannot happen anymore

00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:11,939
so what has to happen is that you really

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:14,429
have to go down the model that some of

00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,839
the large data center operators have

00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:18,569
already figured out do you have to

00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:22,049
figure out a way to upgrade a portion of

00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:24,419
your environment first to make sure that

00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:27,149
it is running fine and then expand the

00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:30,869
footprint over a period of time so

00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:34,469
eventually probably in about a week the

00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:36,629
whole footprint gets upgraded that kind

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:40,199
of innovation has happened in order for

00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:43,619
you to do this work correctly and if you

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,449
had to integrate a new like I said

00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:48,719
before in my last dog as well the new

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:50,669
CLI a new model of interacting with the

00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:53,369
box every time somebody drops a new box

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:55,919
the automation cycle is going to take X

00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:59,129
for a long time so if I had to have a

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,249
very efficient DevOps model where people

00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:05,189
understand how to upgrade how to do

00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:08,519
things fairly quickly you have to have a

00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:12,059
common API interface that I can actually

00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:17,069
use and when we went looking for it i

00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:19,439
think by the years of pain that other

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,479
people have suffered there was a very

00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,539
standard interface that exists in linux

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,699
that actually fit the fit the bill so if

00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,680
you can't take advantage of it it's

00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:33,870
going to be very difficult to

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,979
surely stir that curve again and the

00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:40,620
other stuff that we were actually very

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:45,810
attracted to was that the networking

00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:50,580
stack is extremely flexible did a

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:52,790
virtual machine be it a a container beat

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,680
anything in between that you want to do

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,880
then I the Linux networking stack is

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,750
probably by far the most complex and

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:06,149
also it is most adaptable it runs from

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,300
your Android handsets all the way to a

00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:11,910
large server so it has proven the test

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,010
of time thanks to all the contributions

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,490
by a lot of the people that are sitting

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:21,390
in this room here this is what we see

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:25,040
and that's exactly what we are taking

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:29,220
advantage of so when I actually look at

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,520
Linux as interface for DevOps and other

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,770
activity we actually went looking for

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,440
who all have everybody comes and tells

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,270
me how we run linux I mean that's that's

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,150
a common cliché now everybody has a

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,740
linux operating system it boots up and

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,500
then it gives you a management interface

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,330
and then they hijacked the whole thing

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:55,230
so when we went around looking at who

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:59,690
has the most closest to the MINIX native

00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:02,279
interface implementation we found that

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,980
there are a few vendors that actually do

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,430
better than others so we actually went

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,459
looking for it and we found cumulus has

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,730
one of the most native interface that's

00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:16,410
available today and we also looked at it

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,170
from a futuristic perspective what

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,950
happens when switch there comes to being

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,959
in the 2017 timeframe I think cumulus is

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,529
by far the closest interface that I can

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,970
actually use for a seamless transition

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:35,430
so we actually standardized on cumulus

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:39,290
for better for worse to actually start

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:43,250
that transition from the get-go

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,410
so when cumulus starts when sister

00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,509
starts appearing on the switches in the

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,579
future we don't have to do a lot of work

00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:52,040
in order to integrate our DevOps

00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:55,040
environment into that new switch their

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:58,699
board the other thing that we actually

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,279
went looking for was a fairly

00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:03,259
straightforward way of doing isolation

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,500
and policy management and traffic

00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:08,750
control and there is actually a tool by

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,610
the name traffic control probably there

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,610
are two people in the world that know it

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:17,420
best there's one person here in this

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:20,269
room and I think Eric may know some some

00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,730
about TC but he will not agree to it

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,589
because as soon as you agreed to knowing

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,060
TC there's going to be a lot of

00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:29,120
questions and you would not be able to

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,579
answer them so there is probably going

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,380
to be a TC workshop I think I would

00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,680
advise everybody to attend that so that

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,990
people would know what TC means we

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,259
actually use TC quite extensively in our

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,350
environment to do certain things like

00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,510
policy management and inserting policy

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,069
rules and stuff like that a lot of

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,709
people that have discovered it use it

00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:53,930
quite extensively but it's not well

00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:56,120
known because nobody wants to own the

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,209
headache of explaining to somebody else

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,329
how it works so I would leave it at that

00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:07,370
but it actually is a very rich interface

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:10,130
it works extremely well and uh and we

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:16,130
had no qualms using it and so far it

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:19,550
does what well to our advantage now I

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:24,110
can see harness and jabal saying

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:27,740
something to each other here the two

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:34,130
people that though TC well I guess now

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:38,029
having said that if if if all the things

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:40,790
of your doing line up by the next mednet

00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,450
death we'll probably have one or two

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,670
switches that are good

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:50,190
um switch deaf and one of the early

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,980
switched of contributors i think is not

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:57,480
well he didn't show up today is jennifer

00:12:52,980 --> 00:13:00,900
mellanox i'd only easier today well the

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,070
vessel a metallic steve is here and so

00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,200
there are some people that are actually

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:10,680
actively developing and and contributing

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,110
to both the switch bev as well as the

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,720
traffic control or the TC environment

00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,370
and the additional eat for their

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,300
hardware acceleration pieces that

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:26,760
actually is going to be a huge help in

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:30,930
our keeping their the gap of that the

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:34,110
price versus the growth gap as close as

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,350
possible without which i think it's

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:40,650
going to be a pretty tough time for

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:45,150
people like us to actually do the

00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:49,790
business w do today with that said if

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,790
you have any questions I can answer them

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,180
I'll just make a call me with other

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,600
people who understand to see around you

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,649
know just me how many people have the

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:21,470
same TC in this room okay take down the

00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:30,350
names any questions any questions any

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:31,940
comments well okay so i can actually

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:43,970
give you back for a minute so you can go

00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:49,070
to lunch early so this is a big focus i

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:53,690
should say on TC offloads correct yes we

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:57,290
are quite actively working with a few

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,720
people in this room I should actually

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:03,079
call out mellanox and there they are

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,779
here in large numbers they have been

00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:09,529
actively working with us just like

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:12,640
metronome has in the past to actually

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:16,240
providing a TC interface to their

00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,490
hardware acceleration for their chipsets

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,589
it doesn't just come for the kinect x5

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,800
or connect x4 they are also doing it for

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,810
their NPS line of product as well so

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,589
they are quite active in this

00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:34,550
environment and we are actually actively

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:37,300
looking at deploying them in our

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,300
environment as well

00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:47,029
so would this be a Q&A between you and

00:15:42,769 --> 00:16:04,009
me nobody else wants to ask anything so

00:15:47,029 --> 00:16:07,699
that's good so um if I could correct the

00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:12,499
use of you using cameras like like the

00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:17,420
rocks like the works kind of thing I'm

00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:19,910
using some data centers part of the

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:21,589
child in network or no we are not using

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,189
it as part of the carrier network we are

00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:28,029
using it in in five relatively large

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:31,550
data centers that we have set up for

00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,949
some of the services that we provide the

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,680
services are provided on our carrier

00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:41,089
network but they're not in the actual

00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:44,480
carrier network path but they are fairly

00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:46,579
large data centers they are not they are

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,490
not the IT data centers so to speak they

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:51,709
are actually service data centers so

00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:57,939
what is the reason you are not currently

00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:57,939
using the carrier network any hurdle or

00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:09,829
what the carrier network side has a lot

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:14,059
of deployed systems and they have a lot

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:15,649
of body call it the old method of

00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:18,740
operations and procedures that are in

00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:21,500
place they are not ready to transition

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,289
into a DevOps model yet there are

00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,669
multiple reasons one is if you work in a

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:30,490
carrier you will know there are some

00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:33,320
significant lines of what you call it

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,470
responsibilities and roles and you can't

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,720
cross over so that actually determines

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,630
what how fast you can innovate in the

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,650
carrier space but then the data center

00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:48,020
the same rigor doesn't exist so that

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,790
it's easier for us to deploy in the data

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,360
centers that then move into the courier

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:56,060
space as opposed to the other way around

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:59,600
so do you expect that to expand to Terra

00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:03,440
network in a few years enough in a few

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,950
years once the web as I said that once

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,680
the price point becomes unbearable it is

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,620
going to happen if you looked at how

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,170
many carrier members there were in the

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,600
past you can see the number is dueling

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,580
quite rapidly but now it's actually

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,370
about three or four of them that are

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,450
standing at they are also cutting down

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:29,030
the head come because they're the you

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,340
need a certain amount of volume in order

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,240
to do it but when the pricing power is

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,430
not there it's going to be very

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,820
difficult for you to just keep on doing

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:39,320
that stuff over and over again so at

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,520
some point they had to come to terms

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,710
with using different kind of hardware

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,900
and software model in order to achieve

00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:53,470
that they are achieving at a very high

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:59,390
price today so that's the fact thank you

00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:01,630
hi Steve so ten years ago or so there

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,940
was a big push for carrier grade linux

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,280
seems to died out disappeared in god is

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:14,000
there any of that lingering around and

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:16,280
left is there any thing um so i can

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,770
speak from a personal experience about

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,560
carrier-grade linux carrier-grade linux

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,360
as being there for a while and everybody

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,510
said oh this is the most secure thing

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,900
and this is what you need to use but the

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:32,180
innovation lag so far behind that every

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,370
time I need a feature I have to actually

00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,530
wait in line to back toward a whole

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:40,400
bunch of features back into the carrier

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,860
grade Linux and that told me that not to

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,870
adapt something like a courier bird

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,090
Linux and stay with it because it

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,990
actually made

00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:52,860
criteria OS environment out of an open

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,419
source environment which doesn't help us

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,700
the better way to do better way would I

00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:01,380
be to just give me a profile that I can

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:05,380
run on any Linux that makes it more

00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:07,029
carrier-grade so to speak so I always

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,710
ask the people when they come and pitch

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:11,890
me carry a great Linux what is the

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:14,830
difference that you have that I need

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,470
carrier-grade Linux for and the response

00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:20,549
is always almost always is it's a

00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,549
profile kind of thing

00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:37,780
so just about TC of it so various things

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,760
like OpenStack and lipford and OBS all

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,920
use TC under the covers for bandwidth

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,300
management at like are you using TC

00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,400
directly or is it through one of these

00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:49,240
sort of third-party layers no we are

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,300
using TC director we don't use your abs

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,610
or any of that middle you perhaps talk a

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,900
bit about your use of TC and how you use

00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,970
it what for right so we are actually so

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,540
to go into a little bit of detail we

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,760
actually have a containerized

00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:09,460
application environment and the

00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,440
containerized application environment we

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,720
are probably unique in the sense that in

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,870
a single containerized environment we

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,360
are planning on doing application

00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:20,980
tenancy that means that the river run

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,380
multiple applications on the same

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,570
machine they are all in a flood network

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,000
but they actually had to be isolated

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:31,180
from one another and for that isolation

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,940
purposes we are actually using TC as a

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,850
primary source of isolation we do not

00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,310
use what most of the other people are

00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:42,370
trying to use something like the X land

00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:44,560
kind of contract we do not have the X

00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:49,390
land we don't run bgp across all the

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:57,040
machines we have a very flat network and

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:59,050
its policy control at each node yes what

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,850
is the biggest problem we need to solve

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,910
in the network stock in the next 2-3

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:06,670
years see i think that friend that I see

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:09,210
is that the hardware offload seems to be

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,720
the trend and if that trend continues

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:16,930
then the CPU can be used for what it's

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:19,170
meant to be used now what we are seeing

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:22,810
is there's a lot of networking stuff

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:28,120
leading into the into the processing

00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:29,110
environment a lot and I'm personally I

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,879
don't know whether that's the right

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,609
place or not because we are taking

00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:37,369
and now some people are now trying to

00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:41,299
move that back into a network realm by

00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:43,339
pushing hardware accelerations so we

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:45,409
have been adamant about having the

00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:48,949
hardware do the acceleration piece and

00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:52,099
leave the application piece at the CPU

00:22:48,949 --> 00:22:55,209
environment and as long as that trend

00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:58,279
continues I think we'll be in good shape

00:22:55,209 --> 00:23:01,069
with the higher speeds we should be able
