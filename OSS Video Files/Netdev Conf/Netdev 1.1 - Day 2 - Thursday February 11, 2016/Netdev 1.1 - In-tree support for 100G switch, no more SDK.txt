my name is allowed this is jelly and we

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,429
are going to present you to switch valve

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,469
and this time it's not going to be just

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,389
talking presentation but the real life

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,179
demo so this is what we are going to

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:17,369
show you I see that some of some of you

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,000
came with the switch dev t-shirts that

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,740
mode and in the coffee black we are

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,310
going to we are given them away for free

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:32,130
so you can have one okay so today we are

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,200
going to answer three questions what is

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,500
which dave weiss which there is needed

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,120
and well switch wave is going to and of

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,690
course after that we are going to show

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,320
you a real live demo on a will to pology

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,690
line somewhere in israel ok so what is

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,320
which dev and this is just a quick brief

00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:00,030
for those of you who hadn't attend the

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,879
previous talks and both so switch there

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,170
is a way to extend the linux networking

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,159
and having switch operations so first of

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,439
all in mellanox witches it just by a

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,189
linux box you can have any distribution

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,330
that you want either edit fedora ubuntu

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:23,520
souza whatever and when you put our

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:28,290
driver you just see an ordinary net

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,240
devices and you can do whatever in the

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,610
operation that you did before either

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,939
just stand in a massive in pocket or

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,270
using eth two to see statistics change

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,140
the third state and some of em do of

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:46,320
floats like a villain filtering now

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,270
these devices are just normal devices

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,390
there is nothing special about it except

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,399
that there are no on a real silicon but

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,450
the cool thing about it is the switch

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,320
the verbs which is a new way of the

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:06,149
colonel to do a internic operation such

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,459
as bridging and routing and even moment

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,300
we'll talk about flows and other cool

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:16,150
stuff later on today we have implemented

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:21,340
our driver completely from scratch its

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:23,530
rider in the linux 3am Alex SW and right

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,280
now Van arks is the only event of having

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:31,380
a wheel walking switched up so it went

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:37,120
very cool and we'll talk later on about

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:41,110
the normal SDK our driver was written

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,630
from scratch mainly because having an

00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,330
entry a driver meaning that we are using

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,110
the camera data structure and cannot

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:55,180
databases to have the repository of the

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:57,250
routing or switching and SDKs I don't

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,590
know how many of you uses decay before

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:06,550
but it has its own databases and it's

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:08,880
separate from the camera so why do you

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,850
need to switch Davis there is as decay

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,550
all the other solutions and the keyboard

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,090
around here it's open we are providing

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,130
an open solution so it's a

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,860
community-based we are sending our

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:27,489
patches every one of you and some of you

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,260
already did can send their comments it's

00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,239
open source which means that it's cool

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,690
and everyone can see what is going on

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,030
and not guessing what is going on and

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:39,910
the two more important aspects of the

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,090
switch dev is having a standard behavior

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,230
and standard API everyone can use the

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,989
idea out to package or just taking a

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:53,500
server module eight whatever networking

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,570
activity they want and just use it the

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,940
links already defined the behavioral

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,780
model whether it's dot Wanda bleeders

00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:05,320
dot1q bleeders it's simply they're

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:07,870
walking defined well defined you can use

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,420
it on with yams and multi-talented sent

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:14,320
up and then just exited to deploy it on

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:16,750
a real environment in a second so switch

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,310
stuff is really really important and

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,310
really really cool

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:31,600
yeah so so the question is what we want

00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,880
to do it forward in the future I told

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,460
you tell you what what is implemented

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,449
and what we already have but the future

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:44,259
is ahead so the first thing we are

00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:48,940
working on is a new type of interface

00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:52,440
it's called dead link and basically it

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:56,620
was very hard to or it is very hard to

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,139
handle the ASIC white stuff with the

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,060
existing interfaces like Artie not

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:08,949
linked or ETH too so there there is a

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:14,080
room for something which actually uses

00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:17,410
with the with the idol Nick chip or ACS

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,990
which a sick as a as a handle and you

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:23,620
can do stuff with that for example if

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:27,010
you want to set shared buffers in the

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,960
ASIC it's it's not port specific it's

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,750
shared among the board so you need to

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,550
have something else some other interface

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:40,599
this is dead link we are we sent RFC

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:45,340
next week last week and now the first

00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:48,010
IRC was just implementing port type

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:54,430
setting so we can either set in Finland

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:58,620
or internet so it currently in mlx for

00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:01,780
driver it can be done only by a Sisyphus

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:07,530
non-standard way it's very hockey so

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:12,090
this is redoing it in in the correct way

00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:17,440
okay so next thing we are working on as

00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:20,710
qos so basically what we do is we reuse

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:25,030
the existing dcba now which is in linux

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,370
kernel already eight lines with it

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:32,560
aligns very good with what we have in

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:35,050
hardware so we just we use it and there

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,800
are a couple of things that might need

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,800
to be chained

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:46,599
reached but I think that's mostly it's

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:49,389
okay next thing is l3 afloat the problem

00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:54,610
with the current implementation which

00:06:49,389 --> 00:07:00,069
uses a rocker as a as the only consumer

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:04,509
is kind of broken because after you add

00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:07,270
some some roots and they are floated to

00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:10,810
hardware the problem is then if the

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:13,719
hardware has not enough space to handle

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,069
another route it just everything is

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:17,889
flushed from the hardware and everything

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,469
is done in the inner software again and

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:23,710
the only way to get the roots of load it

00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:26,560
again need to reboot the machine so this

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:30,669
this is really crappy so we need to fix

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,659
the current the current model and also

00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:37,780
we want to look at the vrf support for

00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:45,300
our driver that's not the big thing I

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:51,219
guess here and we always discuss flows

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:55,120
so we plan to implement most probably

00:07:51,219 --> 00:08:00,300
CLS flower as it suits neat and also it

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,300
aligns good with it with the hardware so

00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:10,930
we probably will go in the way that

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:16,419
extends John fast bands patches he sent

00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:19,930
it last week including DC afloat for you

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:22,930
32 classifier I mean he says that he has

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:27,310
flower classifier afloat prepared as

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:34,899
well so we will probably base it on this

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:36,640
pad set and yep a lot of people i talked

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:39,760
with a lot of people yesterday about

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,750
flaws and Alex I for example asked us

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,930
what our hardware is capable of and how

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,480
does the hardware know if you

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,330
just put a key which is a feel inside

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,610
the packet however hard we know where to

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,130
locate the packet well this is how the

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,920
hardware password work works right now

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,570
in our silicone is able to pass the

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,540
pocket no matter if there is tunneling

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,029
or any other will headers valuable

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,459
length headers and that's why we so much

00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,770
love the flower classifier because it's

00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:15,540
very very natural for LASIK which has

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:20,870
built-in puzzles yep so the question is

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:25,459
I think I put the question mark to be BF

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:29,310
so it's it's it looks it bridged that

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:32,300
BPF is the next big thing it's already a

00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:37,740
big thing you saw like saying here

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:43,890
that's good so you have to figure out

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:46,350
how to how to how to handle the the pp

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:52,110
effort and if it would be able to upload

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:55,200
it to existing hardware or not and it

00:09:52,110 --> 00:10:00,300
might be doable but the thing is that it

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:04,529
might be very complex so therefore the ?

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,880
we are not quite sure how to how to

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:14,339
handle this situation yeah we'll see

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:16,950
we'll see about that let yep okay okay

00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,910
so for those of you who wasn't here when

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,010
we started the presentation so I thought

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,529
what we did is just talk about what is

00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:28,970
which they're wise using switch dev and

00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:31,980
well switch stuff is going to and I

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,870
think it was July that we started to

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,470
work on the mellanox implementation

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,529
which is the M alexis w there the

00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,380
silicone driver for and actually we use

00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:45,410
we have two drivers upstream one it's

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,600
called Sweet Cheeks to which is the

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:51,360
previous generation asetek supporting

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,320
30g and the other one is called spectrum

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,940
its day 100g and doing this half a year

00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,640
we work very very hard

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,470
I think yeah we work very very have and

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:07,530
we were able to complete the letter to

00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,420
which was just simply written everything

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,880
from scratch and we are very proud of it

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,190
and now we are going to show you a demo

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,280
of everything we did we did well not

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,830
everything but everything which is

00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:23,820
interesting so we would just show you

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:27,000
how we take an ordinary device and we

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:32,340
have these typologies we have this 100g

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,170
a switch connected to two servers the

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,770
servers are not so much strong so don't

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:40,350
expect a Bigfoot put and they are

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,680
connected with two ports each so we can

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,360
show you lag and region / lag and the

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,660
purpose of this tutorial I'll show you

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,000
that it simply walks there is no need of

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,550
anything just put a travel on and start

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,510
playing with your networking and

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,730
everything that you're putting on your

00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:59,010
console will get reflected into the

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,010
harbor this is the cool thing about the

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:04,350
switch dev there are no inside if if

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,330
anyone will clone the source code you

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,070
will not see a wheel state machine or

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,640
where databases the Linux managers

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:17,700
everything we are just a clean little

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:21,660
driver doing everything em so welcome to

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:25,110
my team ox and you don't see the wet so

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,900
wet ok so in the upper left corner we

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,850
have the console of the switch in the

00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:34,770
bottom you can see the switch statistics

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,810
as Jamal we have a software contest and

00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,630
how to account tests on the right side

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:43,230
we have the two servers connected to the

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,180
switch the reason why we are showing the

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,770
software and the hardware counters is

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,850
because when you are doing a bridging

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:52,980
between two physical tenants the packets

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,440
will not go to the CPU of the switch and

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,810
this is the way to prove you that I'm

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,440
not lying and actually packets are going

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:05,070
for the ASIC silicon if it will go over

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,470
the little CPU on the switch you will

00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:10,010
get like five gigabit of faux pas to

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,010
normal

00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:18,180
okay so GE will talk while I'm tapping

00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:25,400
the commands so give me just a second

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:25,400
organize everything okay

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,710
do you see the phone do you need me to

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:43,000
increase it everyone is able to read it

00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:45,640
yes now bigger I I suggest I don't

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,290
understand you doing like that I this is

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:53,980
bigger okay you don't see it you can

00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:57,460
move to the first life okay I can but

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,870
then what okay so um but then what

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,570
happened is that you don't see the

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,700
statistics so I would just do assuming

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:12,340
it will be not so nice demo as it use is

00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:14,470
it better yeah okay so you will talk

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:19,060
because I'm a man and I cannot do to

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:21,340
thing at the same time ok i will try to

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,790
catch you might and by the way this is

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:30,310
VP m2 is that so it's the latency is

00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:34,360
grab so please forgive me yeah so you

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,750
see the way we have loaded a couple of

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,700
modules so we have Alexis WPC I which

00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:45,460
take care the pci interface we have core

00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,560
just glue with the pci and the drivers

00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:54,220
and we have also the specific a cig

00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:55,990
beverages kodama xsw spectrum and this

00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:01,420
is the ec a drop you can actually

00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:03,250
actually thought no I cannot talk and so

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,740
this is just to prove you that we really

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:14,310
have mellanox IC connected to this

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:14,310
machine and what happened

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:23,590
what happened when you connected just

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,960
load the driver you can see a 36 port

00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:29,140
which is this is the real physical ports

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,710
connected to the switch and you see some

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:38,440
of them is in this connect mod also you

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:41,920
see the switch ID of switch IP value by

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,740
by which you can tell that all the ports

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:50,170
are belong to the same asic if it would

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:54,150
be to a 6 you would see like eth devices

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,150
with to switch IDs

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:09,269
yeah that you have here the technician

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:17,140
meanwhile item Jamar is asking this is

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:20,800
LM stencils simply walking we implement

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,480
that on the asic and yeah and you can

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:28,390
see the files and the temperature is

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:33,070
running on the amex is WPC is so put

00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:35,320
back the IP link so the you're going to

00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:37,029
break scripts right to this why the

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,820
switch ID I don't know that's something

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:41,620
new this number what does it mean no I

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,370
know I know what it means he described

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:49,450
it but it people do pass this output but

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:52,540
that's their problem it is yes actually

00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,149
well come on the party house here yeah

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,730
well Jim out it's true the thing is that

00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:01,050
this output changes all the time you did

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:08,110
you cannot rely on output changes yeah

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:09,970
what's that so anyway that's that's not

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,610
true if you if you if you add something

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,100
if you add some value you can you just

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,530
add it there and it that's it this rich

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,780
idea exist for over a year maybe maybe

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,339
it's in the wrong spot that's why right

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:23,439
maybe that spot there doesn't belong

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,240
you're backed up a favor here's my

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,069
question to you why so just some

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,110
feedback right why do I need to see the

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:33,549
society I can tell from the if' index or

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:35,530
the name no and I can go and tail there

00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:38,049
should be another utility maybe dev link

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:41,080
or some other tool that tells me where

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,220
does this I've index belong yeah okay

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:49,290
but I'm not sure if that's the right

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:52,870
spot all the details option here minus D

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:55,780
command line option to enable or disable

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,419
the switch ID I think that's what the

00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,210
minus D minus D gives more details I

00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:03,760
thought it is in my SD it's not all

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,960
right it's same thing as physical port

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,280
ID for sre devices actually that shows

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,280
up in bindi yeah

00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:20,409
you can come close i work on ya is this

00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,590
an upstream patch to add the switch i D

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:26,470
D and doesn't yeah yeah it's there it's

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:30,389
there for half a year at least and does

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:34,119
it get call for every link or does it I

00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:36,580
mean d it should be an eye Fla attribute

00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:39,700
right yes I was wondering does it get

00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,549
populated for every link or just if

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,970
there is a switch to walk so I don't

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:50,019
remember seeing this that's why hmm yeah

00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:53,200
only it's count yeah only if you have a

00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:56,919
switch default defined and you have you

00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,309
have to have the parent a parent ID

00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,919
attribute I guess it's cold like that if

00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:05,529
you have it defined its it shows there

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:08,289
ok I mean port which doesn't have a

00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:12,220
switch ideate we're not showing it say

00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:14,889
anything yeah and I did I didn't

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,710
mentioned but this is a net next forum

00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:20,080
last week just compiled and this

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:24,190
operating system here it's Ordinary

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,749
fedora fedora 22i I believe we didn't

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,359
modified anything you just put our

00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:30,039
driver on it and change the camera bed

00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:31,989
and this is the cool part of outreach

00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:37,169
stuff just take whatever you won't put

00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:37,169
the driver and that's it ok now

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,520
here's the way that you can query the

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,350
firmware and in the future we are

00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,230
planning to use the eth two female

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:55,150
mechanism to just burn on your femur so

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:59,810
it's just a standard Linux nothing mo

00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:02,270
now let's show a demo that we are

00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:09,070
talking with each other so I'm going to

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:09,070
take just an interface and put it up and

00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:18,400
just pink from a machine to a machine

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:35,299
and right now what happened is that this

00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:37,850
server pinks this week and we can do so

00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:40,820
this actually shows the slow path of the

00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,760
of the switch so get the switch actually

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:47,600
that in this case it doesn't forward the

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:52,640
traffic within the asic but the packets

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:56,240
go to this to the CPU yeah again as as I

00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,200
said before switch to adjust the plan

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:16,900
all my devices nothing nothing fancy

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:21,410
death sorry and now let's do a bridge

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:27,020
sure ok so i will configure these two

00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:29,660
servers we've just say dot1q bridge so

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,090
first of all we give them an IP address

00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,240
i'm going to reuse the same address as

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:39,620
they used before for the slope off why

00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:44,059
because it's faster and we are all lazy

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:50,929
i will do a full screen showing you how

00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:53,750
i configure the bridge which is cool so

00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:56,150
what you see here that i created the

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,690
bridge i enable villain filtering so i

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:01,610
would have a dot 1q bridges and I said

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,500
agent I'm that when the traffic will

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:08,570
stop we'll just see they have the bees

00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:12,040
entries aging out from the bridge let's

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,040
put some pot into the bridge

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:23,679
and if you don't believe me we can see

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,529
the vellum show so we see that when we

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:33,340
created the bridge we got a pivot

00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:34,509
vlan-id one when we do the dot want a

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,419
bridge i'm going to do a villain

00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:44,200
interfaces and show you how it works and

00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:45,909
let's do a su madre right now this is

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:53,039
showing the ftp entries of the bridge

00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:53,039
and whites not zooming out

00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,330
something here's one

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,240
and

00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:21,330
wetumpka duck ok is because of the

00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:27,320
layton think now of the type of the OS

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:27,320
you are using ok

00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:44,590
so let's start with a pink right now I'm

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:47,440
pinging this server with this server I

00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:51,520
don't say if you see the castle but 157

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,630
talks with 1 158 and then we'll go and

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:59,050
see the counters which are now a bit

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:01,540
small and I can prove you that this

00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,550
number the Alex packets with not changed

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,190
and the reason why there is no change is

00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:09,880
because a bridge i hover and once a

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:12,460
bridge a hardware the packets will not

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,910
go there so first of all I mean do it in

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:19,300
pink and then we see that the the switch

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:26,110
learned those mac addresses so they will

00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:31,150
just appear so pinky and then we are

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:33,010
seeing that we learn in you and you see

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,230
the offload over here this is mac

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:37,440
address that we learn and the other way

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:43,540
around we also learn the other direction

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:45,040
pink is walking and now let's look at

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:47,470
the counters they are simply not

00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,560
increasing so where the packets are

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:52,660
going through and this is this window we

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,090
can see that the packets are going for

00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,650
the hardware counters so packets are

00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,830
coming to the boat and going from the

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:07,420
port but the software simply don't see

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:11,980
those packets and now let's see some net

00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:14,740
super buff we want to ask a question

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:20,470
along you want to see a full performance

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:23,740
that's what is that okay hi do you have

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,500
an option standard option using standard

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:31,510
to switch the interface to configure

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:35,740
port mirroring to a certain logical

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:39,640
linux devices so we can use a you know

00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:41,380
TCP dump and have a capture of all the

00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,650
traffic which goes through the ASIC

00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,380
internal in does not

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,320
my default goes up to the colonel so I'm

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,390
not sure we have an option inside the

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,330
silicon to make sure that all the

00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:57,330
packager on the bridge will go also up

00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,830
to the CPU which will just kill the CPU

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,630
and the protocols which are running on

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,160
the cpu for you for example if you are

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,750
running quagga and the whole purpose of

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,410
switch there is dotted you can take a

00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:09,270
plan on quagga run it and the route will

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:13,020
go down to the to the city code it will

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:15,510
just drag that this film pci channel

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,330
that going to the cpu so we thought

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,670
about having like a and you cannot

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,680
capture the promiscuous flag of the net

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,270
device because once you're put in port

00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,840
inside the bridge the promiscuous is

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:30,960
enabled by default so we thought about

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,500
having some kind of special commands

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,440
that let you get those packets for debug

00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,840
purposes but we'll push it way later on

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,270
and about million we are going to

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,020
support me when using flows and you can

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,850
have like a cura same or the drop

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,160
packets or the packet which that you

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:53,160
want we'll just go to another pot and

00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,640
then debug it like that so we are going

00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:01,890
to support that but its way along the

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:06,840
other line it's not ok thanks ok so now

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:09,540
what we'll do is just super path between

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:15,930
those two servers and you will see that

00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:20,240
the help counters are going wild now you

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:20,240
can see that and

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,380
let's wait another five minutes it's not

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,720
five minutes even less and we see that

00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:39,330
we got 40 g which is the PCI gen3 by

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,230
eight that installed on those servers if

00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:50,790
we use a battle server we can get 100 G

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:53,130
and we did that already ok you sure tell

00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:59,970
me that this is not cool it's cool man

00:27:53,130 --> 00:28:03,660
cool how do we account us with software

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:06,830
counters I do they get summed up when I

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:10,740
do I've config or something like that

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:15,150
when I look at that IP link sure you're

00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,520
not summing up you're not oh yeah we all

00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,320
know that everyone we are not adding the

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,770
hardware come to study today I peeling

00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,780
shoe and that's the it's probably a

00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,410
mistake and it should be probably done

00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:30,780
in a different way I know that compose

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:37,710
guys they are doing it they're adding it

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:40,680
yeah but at the first we wanted to have

00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:43,380
the hardware statistics in eth two and

00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,560
in IP link just just the software

00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,940
statistics but i guess we need to extend

00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:53,490
the colonel I pi/2 to have both to have

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,070
like you know celebra gate is that and

00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:59,100
then just harvested so you can actually

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,170
get the software stats from that might

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:03,930
be one way I don't know and regarding

00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,780
your question from yesterday from your

00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,000
talk once we will have a flaws will have

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,730
the ability to put counterspell flecks

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,040
in it but air so you'll have flow

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:15,570
counters but in this case I think what

00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:18,060
cumulus is doing seems to make sense to

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,890
me in the end if I if once you have some

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,910
sort of net link API to each tool I can

00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:25,910
grab the hardware count as if I want to

00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:25,910
yep

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,120
ok what next so so when you rang King it

00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:46,260
looked like the first nine pings were

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:49,130
lost the tenth thing was the first one

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:51,659
that got a reply what happened there

00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:55,020
what was the question I didn't

00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:57,059
understand so when you rent ping the

00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:02,789
first nine pings didn't get a reply the

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:05,970
tenth one and I yeah yeah and we need to

00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:14,669
check it I'm not sure no baby in a

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:16,980
mature now he's asking I mean the first

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:21,419
packet supposed to be flooded and then

00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,820
the packet no need for slow path once

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:25,950
you configure the bleach all the ports

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,230
are banned in the bridge and even before

00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:32,399
the FDB learning the packet supposed to

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:34,260
get flooded and actually they get they

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,770
do get flooded there is something here

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:41,309
in this topology my server I need to

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:48,330
check it but it shouldn't happen that's

00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:52,830
about it ok so let's move to da 20

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:55,559
bridges okay that went deep bridges is

00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:58,230
actually having to villain interfaces

00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:02,159
and bridging on top of them and the

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:06,450
bridge ian is unaware for these two

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:11,039
villain interfaces and only those two

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:12,720
villains belong to the bridge so what we

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,090
are going to do is use it put in here

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:22,200
villain 5 and put in here will and fall

00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:27,110
and hope that it will work ok so i'm

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:30,740
configuring on the switch the

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:35,960
m the villain villain 5 which

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:41,630
corresponding to this server and then

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:44,120
that's giving an IP address and make

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:53,240
sure that the villain interface is an

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:56,360
update and let's do the same on the

00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:04,970
bottom server you just give them didn't

00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:07,429
fall and let's if people doesn't see

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:10,340
what I put just added these two villain

00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:13,840
interface to be a one and change the

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,840
stead of the BR one to be up

00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,610
let's create human interface

00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:44,179
and let pink those two for the villain

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:48,969
interface so there is no but there is no

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,969
pink toe on the villain interfaces

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:21,520
br1 so we see that the MAC addresses got

00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,610
land on the villain interfaces not on

00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:27,460
the physical ports themselves and pink

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:34,090
is going well let's do something a bit

00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:39,820
more crazy like super perv it's not

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:42,820
crazy and again you can see the hardware

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:45,299
counters of the port counter is going

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,299
wild

00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:02,420
and we see 40g around 40 g it's a bit

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:08,660
less than previous time any questions

00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:16,520
about the doctrine diligence hey how

00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:20,120
cool is it yeah and let's see luck cap

00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,920
you want to reveal use bonding mmm okay

00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,920
just use team is better okay

00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:45,740
let delete the villain interfaces it

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:50,690
really quick we need to change the

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:52,970
interface and down and this is this is

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,060
the switch just to remind you and what

00:34:52,970 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm doing is just created a team and

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:04,400
added two devices to the team that's it

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,200
and I created another team for the other

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:16,790
server and we have two logs and now what

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:22,310
we need to do reach them so now we have

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:32,650
two teams working on the same a bridge

00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:32,650
that it let's do the same on the servers

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:59,440
yep so now now a lot this setting up the

00:35:55,089 --> 00:36:03,230
the team on first server so we will have

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:07,160
on the switch will have to two teams

00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:08,990
each with two ports and are on the

00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,510
server's we will have the image with

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:13,510
each with two ports as well

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,520
yep

00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:46,040
okay okay so that it this is for the

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:49,880
typologies we created the hell we

00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,880
created we created a team we created

00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,890
another team and this in the switch side

00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:01,570
we just created two teams and preach

00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:01,570
them now let's do a performance test

00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,210
let's do the other way around

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:46,550
and the first one finished that's it ok

00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:49,700
so now and we don't have what to show

00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:53,210
anymore we can think we finish the

00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:57,730
tutorial yep yeah and if anyone has a

00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,730
question or answer yeah

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,520
pardon my voice does igmp work yet or is

00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,730
that a work in progress yeah it did we

00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:22,370
submitted a pet that I think a month ago

00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:26,090
before the closing window and another

00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:28,850
one doing the IP route to a print him

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:31,640
the way that its work is that we reflect

00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:34,400
the MDB entries the multicast entries

00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,610
into the hardware and we just add ports

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,740
and we have a rule that all I GMP

00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:42,980
packets will go and slow us to the CPU

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:47,150
so the colonel came the bridge component

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:49,640
can learn the multicast group and then

00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:53,000
it's considered a hard work so multicast

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,740
is not being flooded but just a plain

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,550
normal logic be snooping nothing special

00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:00,620
about it we didn't show it here because

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,930
we were lack of service we could do a

00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:12,100
namespace an expert in the NS basis but

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:12,100
ok ok any more questions

00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:29,070
a question regarding 80 two dot one AD

00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:33,570
the queuing Hume do you have any plans

00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:38,820
for making any user space a hierarchical

00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:41,790
tree representation of which see

00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:45,540
villains belong to each s villains so we

00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:47,700
can you know when user has to manage

00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,190
let's say thousands of villains it's

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,460
more easier to see it in hierarchical a

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,230
kind of way ewan q doesn't related to

00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,470
the number of villains just tacking the

00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:01,200
villains on each other it was plainly

00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:05,040
that Florian wanted to submit the

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,690
patches is not here but I think that we

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,670
talked about in florin wanted to submit

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,140
it a patch to switch dev and then we

00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:12,650
said that we can implement that because

00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:17,849
our hardware supported it it's about it

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:21,750
but we can do it later on in the

00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:35,640
immediate time our customers didn't

00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:39,300
request it a yes we have but oh but I

00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,790
can i canna x a white now we a we are

00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:45,510
going to do flows of lot flower

00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:47,160
classifier the eth tool and peppers this

00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:52,790
is what we are going to start with and

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:55,260
the left we offload a vrf no spaces

00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:58,290
first of all we we have quality of

00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,320
service shall buffer and that we're

00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:09,000
going to submit soon and port splitter

00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:15,810
by though this dislike there but what is

00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,310
being expected in 2016 so we know we

00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:23,250
gonna have everything

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:25,530
I hope that another hardware vendors

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:28,800
will follow our path and join the switch

00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:32,070
deaf community I think that this is one

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,690
of the most lacking in the switch dev we

00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:39,060
don't care what other vendors will just

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:41,880
use your switch yeah but hopefully soon

00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,130
yep though well if my boss is here

00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,870
actually no budget they are other

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,810
hardware vendors which are actually

00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:54,180
doing it and do start the small DSA

00:41:48,810 --> 00:42:00,620
devices yeah they esa doesn't have first

00:41:54,180 --> 00:42:08,610
in the face this is the major problem

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:11,850
cannot run quagga regarding when so

00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:14,550
basically is lad said it's a matter of

00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:16,620
resources and business opportunities so

00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:20,400
we are pushing it all the way to the end

00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:22,650
no matter what the question when is you

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,830
know a matter of first we need to have

00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,900
the help of this community to work

00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,910
around those issues like we presented

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,920
yesterday in the buff how do we make

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,110
those baby steps not reinventing the

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,670
colonel from beginning and try to make

00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:41,250
it a production worthy a device and

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:43,740
hopefully you know we were labeled we

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:46,770
will be able to pull in the team to grow

00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:50,610
and come up I believe that we will have

00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:53,670
a solution that we are proud of them we

00:42:50,610 --> 00:43:01,200
can you know start to deploy by the end

00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:05,250
of 2016 okay another thing that we want

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,850
to say that we have a testing framework

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,730
based on reddit an lms tea and we are

00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:14,070
going to up to meet so everyone that

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,810
uses server switching and region can

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,860
simply take it and execute that it's

00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:22,350
absolutely it is yeah it up yeah okay so

00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:28,589
yeah basically what's going on is that

00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:33,279
we need verification for why

00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:36,219
good question so so we are using this

00:43:33,279 --> 00:43:40,450
Ellen SD framework which is being

00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:43,089
developed heavily by Red Hat and we are

00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:45,729
using the same framework for four

00:43:43,089 --> 00:43:51,509
switches because basically what it can

00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:55,089
do it it it will allow you to work with

00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:57,459
separate machines and our switch is

00:43:55,089 --> 00:44:02,229
another machine so we can work with it

00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:05,229
as well and the only test that we are

00:44:02,229 --> 00:44:11,289
not upstream and campus dexia ones oh

00:44:05,229 --> 00:44:23,769
yeah yeah we are just limited to a net

00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:26,459
bio 5f super buff we don't hear you we

00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:26,459
can't hear you

00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:48,900
so it will it's already is this set up

00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:52,319
as a third today the bottom is in the

00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,650
server themselves which has by eight PCI

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,309
devices this is the problem if you pull

00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:02,189
it on Ixia you can get a line right also

00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:04,439
it depends on 100 G flat and also it

00:45:02,189 --> 00:45:08,969
depends on the under on the what you are

00:45:04,439 --> 00:45:11,099
actually pushing through so and also I

00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:15,989
lashing out yeah how you have to set up

00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:21,809
a shingle grit and lacp I mean in the in

00:45:15,989 --> 00:45:28,159
T bowling so probably this we didn't

00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:28,159
have matching algorithm set up 404 no

00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:35,189
but we do reflect the hash algorithm in

00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:36,630
the team and bond if you configure a

00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:40,009
team and you change the hashing

00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,009
algorithm its would go to the hub

00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:52,390
okay so come and take the t-shirts doing

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:55,420
black time and if you have any questions

00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:59,440
you can come and talk to us and we do

00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:01,950
hope to see some network operating

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,240
system vendors using this witch love

00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:09,250
because it's cool and this is the right

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,980
way of doing stuff cool cool yeah that

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,470
that's the keyboard now it's right it's

00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,060
more than cool using the can of

00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:21,960
databases right like that way absolutely

00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,960
okay thank you very much

00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,980
