Title: Netdev 0x12 - Keynote: Evolving from AFAP Teaching NICs about time
Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 2 - Jul 12 2018
Description: 
	We were pleased to announce our Netdev 0x12 keynote speaker: Van Jacobson

For most people involved in the networking world, Van needs very little introduction for his work, amongst many, in TCP/IP network performance and scaling of the internet. For the young lads amongst us who may be oblivious of his accomplishments, Van is typically referred to as a G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) or as a living legend[1] for others. A few of his accomplishments are listed on his Internet Hall of Fame Induction bio: https://www.internethalloffame.org/inductees/van-jacobson

Much could be enumerated for his many accomplishments and current passions - but we wanted to highlight one buzzword in particular: You would not have EBPF today if Van was not there[2].

At the moment, Van is involved, at Google, in a passion of his - Network Performance Scaling.

Having Van at this conference was both a privilege and an honor as he has seen a lot of ideas take wing from the early days of the internet to the specialized roles around Data Center, Web, IOT and more that we see today (July 12th, 2018). We wished to learn from this sage.

To paraphrase European Communication Magazine[3]:
"When Van Jacobson has something to say, people listen."

And Van had something he wanted to say to us at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal:
We need to teach Network Interface Cards about time.
What kind of surgery do we need on the kernel NIC interfaces?
What kind of features do NIC vendors need to provide?
Tune in and listen to Van.
