Title: Netdev 0x12 - Smart Network Analytics with BPF using Skydive and CogNETive
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 2 - Jul 12 2018
Description: 
	Liran Schour and Nicolas Planel discussed using the Skydive eBPF filtering capabilities and networking information to create network analytics/insights with their tool CogNETive.
They showed how CogNETive utilizes the collected information to provide operational insights for network troubleshooting (eg anomaly detection).
In their talk on July 12th, 2018, they demonstrated how operators can drill-down on connectivity issues all the way to a single Linux interface at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal.

CogNETive uses several common open source components (Grafana, ElasticSearch, Spark, etc ...) to create a layer of network analytics on top of Skydive.
