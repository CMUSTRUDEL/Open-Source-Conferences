	00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,089
yeah this is the workshop summaries that

00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:10,700
happened yesterday which is we just give

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:14,429
them one five minutes like a to attend

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,969
the slides disappeared the slides

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,969
disappear

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,949
good morning everyone I am going to just

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,379
give a summary about this workshop that

00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:04,309
we had yesterday on supporting switch is

00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:07,189
a offload the primary goal of third

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:11,420
workshop was to promote Linux API Linux

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:15,110
ecosystem offloads and switch to have

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:18,680
offloads to switch ASIC to switch ASIC

00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:21,380
and I started with round up on all the

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,130
updates to switch dev that have happened

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,869
in the past year the primary being

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,090
resource management we have talked about

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,780
resource management many times and

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,270
switched out buffs and workshops

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,710
previously in previous net devs so that

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,840
resource management did receive some

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,819
updates we have failures from the

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,360
reported from the kernel on Hardware

00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:47,659
errors on programming routes or FTB

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,060
updates I did also talk about bridge and

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:55,340
routing updates in the context of switch

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:57,619
off loads we did talk about newer Asics

00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,319
coming with larger scale and the need

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:04,580
for scaling forwarding entries up to

00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,879
half 4 million entries networking

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,810
features that received a boost for

00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,800
offloading to switch ASIC were

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:14,390
policy-based routing why so the switches

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:20,900
switch Asics usually offload them wire

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:22,310
ACLs self-test networking code has been

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,700
getting a lot of contributions to

00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,190
self-test tests these days and offloads

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,709
and switch dev was not an exception

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,870
there and I have there are slides

00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:35,030
available on the summary of all the

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,120
updates and a lot of references to

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,680
patches and code code references in

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,810
those slides we did have guest speakers

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,470
Maddy Kadosh from Mellanox

00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:52,400
he did give an intro to spectrum to

00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:57,050
next-gen ASIC which comes with larger

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,819
table sizes and things and he talked

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,939
about some ideas on implementing

00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:05,890
resource manager in ml x SW which is

00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:10,049
their open source Wichita phase

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:14,189
switch ASIC driver and he we did discuss

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,189
resource management failure handling

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:21,519
Sajith chief talked about actually I

00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:25,349
would say he wanted to give a world cup

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,819
update I would say but we told him to

00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:30,819
lean away from that and talk a little

00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:35,739
bit about missing pieces in building a

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:38,109
Linux NAS and he did talk about the need

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,049
for a generic abstraction whether it's

00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:42,939
AI or p4 and there are switched of

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,389
another layer of switched of abstraction

00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:51,219
maybe and also resource management need

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:52,449
for resource management prem from

00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,879
barefoot

00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:56,939
he's another hardware and a vendor who

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,900
was a guest speaker he did talk about

00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:04,840
barefoot programmable a hardware and the

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,939
current thinking about how to offload to

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,519
a programming hardware and this has been

00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:14,019
talked about in the TC workshop as well

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:17,380
maybe jamal will be covering that but

00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:22,509
yeah before and whether it's acai which

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:25,680
is of non Linux or a Linux TC or XDP or

00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:32,340
switch dev abstraction based offload 2

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:36,460
programmable a sex that's all I had and

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:43,199
we got heckled by Jamal to get off to

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:46,199
finish on time any questions ok

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,199
questions

00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,060
no thanks Luka okay Alex you wanna go

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,440
next

00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,440
you don't need slides

00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:06,190
okay then then why don't I go and then

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:15,030
you go right send them to Alex Alexander

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:15,030
and where's Alexander Alexander is yes

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:32,950
okay so we had a three-hour session

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:34,810
yesterday I'm working on some

00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,480
documentation I spent about five minutes

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,130
showing teasing the crowd with the dog

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:44,770
the what the document looks like I have

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,960
about 30 pages so far I put a proposal

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:50,190
for arbitrary metadata setting for TC so

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,720
this is within the scope of just the TC

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,240
pipeline so from the classifiers to the

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,940
actions loops within the actions loops

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,090
within the classifiers an ability for

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:04,690
user space applications to specify with

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:10,479
brand new kernel code without using the

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:16,240
skb fields in the proposal was in was to

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:21,880
use the TCC b sk BCB structure mari

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:28,500
proposed flexible parser for in context

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:32,320
of p4 this was essentially - so p4 has

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:38,760
you can write arbitrary protocols on

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:41,140
people and Linux you tend to have fixed

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,539
dissectors and people don't like it when

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:47,260
you touch that a sector code so he

00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:50,950
proposed the BPF extension to the de

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:53,050
sector antonin from barefoot talked

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,169
about the p for linux architecture

00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,789
suggestion he made that rope a bit

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:02,470
touched on all the slides are going to

00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,620
be online and the video is going to be

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,370
online this is just a summary to let you

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,789
know what happened

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:17,320
Vlad sitting over there has an X and

00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:20,020
exciting updates to the class updating

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,210
classifiers he movie shows it going from

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,220
a hundred thousand updates per second to

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,240
five hundred thousand he's got a lot of

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,979
patch sets got about five or six still

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,979
yeah its total of sixty patches

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,430
I'm very excited what he's doing conga

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
connected remotely and talked about the

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,960
cutest clocks and he has some

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:47,130
suggestions on it about four proposals

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:51,570
on how he would improve that get rid of

00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:54,030
the locks use RC you still walk

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,380
it's an RFC level so he is probably

00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:59,130
going to be putting out some patches on

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:07,040
the list sometime soon that's all I had

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:10,220
to say any questions are the slides from

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,220
Alex there

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:40,379
okay so did they have slides or not

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:53,680
I've got DisplayPort don't have HDMI so

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,680
I can just go if need to be

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,060
if nothing else the slides their slides

00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:05,660
they'll be posted later anyway so for

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,839
the iov workshop covered three areas

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,630
first one being mac VLAN what basically

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,730
went over the recent fixes we've had to

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,440
do too Mac VLAN in order to get it fully

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,730
functional on the two drivers that we're

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:23,350
currently supporting the McAfee laner

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,350
aka l2 forward offload I got it

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,799
[Music]

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:38,010
yeah this is mini-display I need a

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,630
full-size DisplayPort anyway basically

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,460
cover the fact that I have a set of

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,000
patches are currently out on the net dub

00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,290
mailing list to support txq selection

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,450
via what I'm calling a subordinate

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:54,000
device in order to work around the need

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:55,920
for n do select queue and during the

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
discussion session one of the things

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,940
that got pointed out is that we may want

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,860
to look at supporting OVS using this

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,050
just because at that point then you

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,460
could use it as a bypass to essentially

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,460
bypass some of the switching logic for

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,420
OBS which would be an optimization so

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,120
that's one thing we may want to look

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:17,640
into doing second topic was SRO V using

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,010
pair of virtual a caver do as a standby

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,350
path the patches are in the kernel now

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,530
for supporting that at least on the

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,000
kernel side and QM use side it sounds

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,250
like we have an agreement between Red

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,510
Hat and us in terms of Red Hat owning

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,490
the QEMU bits and one of the things that

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,860
came up was that we may in terms of

00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,940
hiding the lower devices one of the ways

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,100
you might be able to get away with doing

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,450
that would be it to create a namespace

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,760
and have the lower devices basically

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,990
live there which actually from the sound

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,270
of things that may actually resolve a

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,490
number of issues where you're seeing and

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:55,560
may actually make this whole set up a

00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:59,730
lot cleaner let's see and then there we

00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,140
go okay so yeah can we move on to the

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:06,510
second slide all right I got the slide

00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:11,040
control here okay and the last topic was

00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:12,150
V host data path acceleration as far as

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,250
that when it was mostly general

00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:16,740
discussion on the topic this is kind of

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,930
a new thing just with a brief

00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,610
explanation in terms of the mix the fact

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:26,420
that it's a mix between emulated and our

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,980
pair of virtual and direct designed

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,240
functionality we didn't make any final

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,230
decisions there I don't know if this is

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
really even the right if I needed to be

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,870
making the final decisions on any of it

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,480
as one of those things where I just

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,710
wanted to bring that to the conference

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,200
just so that people were aware that that

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:42,200
was going on that's pretty much it

00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:50,190
question question questions for Alex

00:11:51,990 --> 00:12:05,680
okay thanks up so mean you know go okay

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:10,180
you got so many slides IPSec IP say it

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,880
Stefan here stefan schmidt yeah just

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:17,130
come and talk yes give a summary you go

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,130
lost after this after

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:34,400
so I'm here to give the quick summary of

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:38,240
the IPSec workshop that we had at

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:40,550
Dresden earlier this year this was

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,860
sponsored by second it it was a first of

00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,350
its kind and we had about 25 people out

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:47,330
there they represented various pieces of

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,900
the IPSec stack we had people from Swan

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:53,420
the userspace packages both strongswan

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,400
and open Swan we had people from the

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,970
drivers during the offload we had people

00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:08,600
from the stack it would help to have the

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:09,770
slides alright so I think that everybody

00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,540
came out of the workshop feeling really

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,890
good because for the first time we saw

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,380
the thing from top to bottom there you

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,420
go so the summary of the workshop is

00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:23,930
available on the website listed over

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:25,370
there and I think that seeing the people

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,500
working on the other parts of the stack

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:30,620
them your focus was actually really

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,030
helpful I know that the Swan guys

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,800
especially the libery small and strong

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:36,110
swarm guys had never met face to face

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,970
and this is really good for them the

00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:43,760
topics that were discussed in the next

00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:45,980
slide where the topics that were

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,840
discussed are listed in the workshop

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,010
notes and you can see that they covered

00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,450
a lot of things that's in the next slide

00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:56,720
we discussed netfilter features we

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,930
discussed gnu/linux support for features

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,550
like PFT hardware offered shadows

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:06,650
especially in the in the face of

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:09,490
virtualization QoS an IPSec some of the

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,490
new things that we had not anticipated

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,790
crypto racing callbacks there's a whole

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,290
bunch of rate of things virtual XFR

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,500
interfaces was interesting to Android

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,150
for example so being able to cover such

00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,660
a wide range of topics was possible

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,920
because everyone was over there so

00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,640
that's pretty much the summary and you

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,110
can find details notes in the workshop

00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,110
notes so any questions

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:41,899
yeah oh I'm sorry okay I'm not I said

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:49,670
that's pretty much the short summary in

00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:52,270
thanks thank you thanks hello okay

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,270
Stefan

00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,920
so morning everyone so no slides from my

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,820
side I'd fall asleep yesterday my hotel

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:06,520
room sorry for that

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,020
so just a short summary on the IOT

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,540
networking protocols workshop from

00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,660
yesterday so it has been gone long

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:18,070
Alexander myself presenting on mostly on

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:21,850
15.4 6lowpan and on the Laura work John

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:23,710
Hong is doing right now so we had a

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,420
little feedback coming from the audience

00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,920
on what kind of gaps we have still in

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,570
the subsystems what kind of stuffs they

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,430
need for your commercial applications

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,770
that was really good because the work

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,540
being mostly doing have been driven by

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:37,500
our own interests and not really what

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,120
kind of commercial aspects are there and

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,010
then we have been talking about the

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,170
Laurel subsystem which is kind of

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,940
interesting because there's also a

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:48,160
discussion about that going on at up

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,200
right now and that's in different clouds

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,450
coming from there so it's good to see

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,790
that Jian hyung and Alexander andreas

00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:00,070
however will work together on that so

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,900
what else did we cover there yeah so we

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,760
also had interest in different header

00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,950
compression techniques so one person

00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,860
came to me and asked about espeak header

00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,540
compression um he's going to have some

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,910
students but nonetheless we try to get

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,500
that rolled into the other 6lowpan hello

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,080
compression we have already said in and

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,330
there's also some interest in static on

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,550
aesthetic context had a compression that

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,550
was really useful so something like low

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:27,190
range low power networks like Laura for

00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:30,250
example but haven't really seen much

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:34,050
development that area yet so I think

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,050
that's all so questions on that side

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:44,980
any questions oh thanks differ it will

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:48,370
take a short break and a keynote speaker

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:55,569
will that exactly what time what's the

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:58,060
next session nine nine twenty whatever

00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:01,860
the schedule says so we've got about 15

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,860
