Title: Netdev 0x12 - Challenges migrating from NDIV to XDP
Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: Netdev 0x12 - Day 2 - Jul 12 2018
Description: 
	HAProxy is a well known high performance TCP/HTTP load balancer used as a front end to applications by many very-large sites. Often HAProxy is stationed at the frontiers of the wild wild west internet in the defense against DDOS - and at the heart of the storm sits PacketShield. PacketShield is built using NDIV. NDIV has been deployed very effectively to date and handles the intended line-rate 10Gbps processing under a variety of hostile real-world DDOS attacks.

Willy Tarreau and Emeric Brun had been contemplating migrating NDIV to use XDP. In this talk, presented on July 12th, 2018 at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal, Emeric described what NDIV did well and what was currently lacking with XDP to make it convincing to make the jump.
