Title: Netdev 0x12 - How hard can it be? Adding Multipath TCP to the upstream kernel
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	Mat Martineau, Matthieu Baerts, Christoph Paasch, and Peter Krystad have been working on kernel Multipath TCP (RFC 6824) support.

There have been difficulties in the past in upstreaming this implementation due to its invasive architecture; however, the authors feel that they have better understanding since the last time they showed up at netdev conf 0.1:
The current MPTCP implementation has moved from it research-y origins and is already used by millions of devices in production environments. The protocol standardization is also now complete. For these reasons the authors feel that experience has gained them a lot of insight and they are ready to move forward with upstreaming.

In this talk, Mat Martineau and Matthieu Baerts gave a gentle introduction of Multipath TCP and mentioned some uses cases already in production. They discussed the challenges faced - both resolved and
ongoing. More importantly they looked for feedback on how to best revamp the current implementation for upstreaming purposes.

This talk takes place on July 13th, 2018 at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal.
