submission process okay so if this is

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,370
like the band introducing the band

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,540
members and they go through all of them

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,790
the leader never gets to introduce

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,870
himself or compliment himself so let me

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:29,300
do that Thank You Jamil

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,300
[Applause]

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,800
if it wasn't for him

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:37,070
well there probably be no conference so

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,100
this is his baby a great job I think

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:47,750
this is a spectacular success so thank

00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:50,660
you very much so I was supposed to give

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,870
a little update on the Oh

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,310
so the submission we a continent

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,490
instituted a little bit of different

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:01,340
process this time we went more with a

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:05,120
double blind review him kind of like

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,310
sitcom but not quite as strenuous so all

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,030
submissions come in to a single point

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,570
which we call a submission Shepherd they

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:18,799
see everything and then the Shepherd

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,410
anonymizes the submission sends it to a

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,980
sub first sends it to the full committee

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,419
and we do a check to see if there's a

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:31,850
conflict of interest basically so a

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,680
conflict of interest checks oh oh I work

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,990
for that company of that person and

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,060
things like that so we did get quite a

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,220
few of those so that the committee was

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,979
very honest and upfront about that and

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,650
there's no no issue with recusing

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:49,580
yourself so we did promote that so

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:52,250
second phases once we have gone through

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,840
that process then we select a panel of

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,270
the committee members so I think we had

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,410
eight or nine of them so it was about

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:03,050
five members per panel selected quasi

00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,150
pseudo randomly so even though we do

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,640
have some expertise amongst a committee

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:10,250
in certain areas we didn't worry too

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,430
much about that because my feeling is

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:18,470
that getting good content that is is

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,600
general enough for everybody we need

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,010
good people with good background so I

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,110
think that worked out pretty well we

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,320
were getting quite a response so the

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,220
committee does a discussion phase

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,890
amongst this and again this is all

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,580
anonymized so it's a small community

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,590
obviously there's probably some

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,410
possible to deducing who's doing what

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,210
but for the most part watching the

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,110
communications and discussions it's all

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:48,320
very objective and for the most part it

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,660
was looking at this looking at the

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,130
proposal occasionally we need more

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,870
information so we had this thing called

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:58,310
Shepard request so we would actually go

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,950
back to to the submitter ask for more

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:02,920
questions get some more feedback

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,630
committee would would discuss that and

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,990
then at the end we would have a little

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,840
write-up use the this is good

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,050
presentation please focus on this or

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
sometimes just good presentation

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,620
sometimes it was you know please rewrite

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,300
the abstract so it was generally

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,720
constructive feedback and I think that's

00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,370
important to always give that feedback

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,530
as one thing I learned from Syd Kyle

00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,810
always good the feedback for future

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:33,710
reference if nothing else so once that

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,880
happens and kind of went into right now

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,800
we're using a spreadsheet I think we ran

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,870
automate some of these tools I went into

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,520
a spreadsheet and then it was

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,440
acknowledged and we send out the email

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,330
and then Jamel kind of took over with

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,060
the scheduling side of things we would

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,300
schedule it so I'm hoping it wasn't too

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,130
much effort on the committee I think we

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,210
really wanted the committee to just just

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:59,030
focus on the technical merits of the

00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:03,560
proposal and I would point out that that

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,060
the committee really is kind of unbiased

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,800
and we try to get objectivity

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,440
so you notice there's they're like no

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,300
members here that are officially

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,880
associated with net dev society which is

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,430
kind of the the legal entity that runs

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,419
this so Jamel Co I'm on the board and

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:23,300
Paul was on the board so we kind of try

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:25,400
to have a separation there and really

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,510
want the program committee to mostly be

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,890
an independent voice and the chair also

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,280
has a little bit more responsibility

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:36,110
trying to set the tone of the conference

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,100
and in this tone I mean there were some

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,660
obvious themes that you could probably

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,180
deduce them and I think that's going to

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,300
happen every conference we're going to

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,740
have hot spots you know BPF is super hot

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,220
and now we're seeing some of the people

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,900
and bbr TCP congestion for mobile they

00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,250
start to come come up so you see these

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,530
trends in the industry and they're gonna

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,920
appear here so it's good to have that

00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:03,110
sort of app and flow any questions on

00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,120
that there's a feedback session at the

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,780
end but feel free to just go to the mic

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,750
and we'd like to improve things so get

00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,700
to the mic and say what what what

00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:19,010
whether the technical process of

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,300
selection please thank you for

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,270
organizing and thank you for doing

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,450
everything this is fantastic just one

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:29,720
very tiny bit of feedback please let's

00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,450
not do OpenOffice templates again yeah

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,110
for the for the paper that was that was

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:40,880
more time I spent that I can't get back

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,880
I'm sorry I open offices great I've used

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,810
it in the past but it was just a massive

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:51,680
pain to use that but that's my only tiny

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:54,800
bit of feedback no I we get we got some

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,740
feedback on Atlantic the MIT guys are

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,780
still here right there was some feedback

00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,690
maybe we could use the ACM is it the SEM

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,310
or yeah you know the only one who suffer

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,500
throat I think I suffer through it might

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:11,060
as well but it was the best we had at

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:14,420
that time and yeah so both ACM and News

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,670
Knicks have published late tech

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,560
templates this is what c-calm and NS d i

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:21,440
use so that's that's what we ended up

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,270
using for what we submitted so is it

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,550
free that we can we can use it is in

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,060
public yeah they're open source so we

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:33,050
can use the ischium ii logic template

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,640
the the pain of course as if I'm just

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,960
doing a two page so I'm bring a sitcom

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,970
page but it makes a lot of sense cuz I'm

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,250
gonna put in a lot of stuff if I'm doing

00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,370
a two page two pager it's a lot of

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:47,870
overhead for doing just one small thing

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,460
personally I I I have no idea why any of

00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,650
these people are still doing to column

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,990
it's not like anybody's printing this

00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,600
stuff anyways so I really think that we

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,069
should basically move away from

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,839
and call them away from me simply there

00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:02,050
are other templates user nips uses a

00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,430
single column like the you know the nips

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,660
conference they use a single column

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,430
format later prefer and that's that's

00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,170
what a lot like however if you if you

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,670
don't want to undergo the beef if you're

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,829
not if you're not a grad student and

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,800
you're not you know always using lattic

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:17,829
it's something of a pain to set it up

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,360
just for a two pager that's that's my

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:24,310
better feedback I don't have a concrete

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:29,819
solution here but yes the Google Doc is

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,819
okay Google is not that evil is it

00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:36,579
Google could be terribly evil their

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:38,920
products are good though okay so yeah

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:40,660
either there's some people I know people

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,790
were very good at lattic I'm looking at

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,149
one right there but no I cannot guy

00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:49,300
there but what if you don't want to use

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:51,339
lytic so I I'm completely I'm very

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,649
comfortable with logic it's just that I

00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:55,389
don't have a setup when I when I'm going

00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,250
to do this cuz it's been a while since

00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:00,189
I've done it and I have to go set up

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,259
everything for for a two pager whereas

00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:04,540
if I was to do a Google Doc it's a

00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:07,000
common way for me to collaborate and I

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,009
find that to be convenient so if if

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,959
there is no specific template

00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:15,060
requirement it's a lot easier for me to

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:21,939
simply do this with Google Docs that

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:24,689
would be fine with me as well and okay

00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:30,910
so what do other people think Google Doc

00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:33,160
as an alternative to Atlantic no Google

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,250
Doc what other options are the Google

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,240
gives what-what for Windows what I don't

00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:41,230
know what they call it anymore

00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,329
John I think as long as you know PDF is

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,370
actually submit it I mean if and if you

00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,050
can actually provide the the template

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,899
for Google dog as well I mean it should

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,550
work right yeah if you suppose it's like

00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:53,139
just like a general template and then

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,120
anyway everybody else can do their own

00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:56,889
tool but it had the same look and feel I

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,130
think everybody will be happy

00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:01,990
right it is not like we are pre wiggly

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,790
we want consistency that's the most

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,819
important part right so we want all the

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,870
docs no I understand so you can provide

00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:09,820
a guidelines

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,980
but you know like how you want things to

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,200
look like and then everybody can use the

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,440
tool because we are not printing you

00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,790
know the whole proceedings for people

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,029
who are gonna be comparing paper with

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:26,050
paper

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:27,279
okay sorry I'll just add all I wanted to

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,800
actually say and I should have distilled

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,690
this if you can moving from two column I

00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,230
don't care what we use two column is the

00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:37,450
was a massive pain for me so okay so

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,040
alright alright I mean I'm not sure if

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,810
that's the best use of our time for this

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,150
discussion but like all the conferences

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,250
have actually templates in Bartek and in

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,520
word which like look the same at the end

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,380
right it's a Linux conference so I I I

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,680
know there's some secret Windows users

00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,870
here but I haven't used when doing 20

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,620
years problem anything other than Linux

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,620
in 20 years

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,300
[Music]

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,100
all right sorry go ahead

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,020
I actually have a bit of feedback about

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,540
the submissions process it would be nice

00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,360
to use like something like hot crap

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,310
instead of emails because I know for our

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,839
paper we had problems with sending to

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,040
the wrong email address aleksander is

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,720
working with something like that who

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,180
will be after this conference yes

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,650
Alexander you're looking at I can see

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,240
from this now right now I know what

00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,750
David Aaron was talking about just I got

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,220
the lights on front right the lights

00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,459
anybody any of the speakers don't like

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,050
this lights okay can we leave without

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:42,580
the light so you need the lights the

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:43,959
audio visual guys okay so yeah we're

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,060
working with something I should say

00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:51,310
right it'll be a lot more automated for

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:57,000
the next next fashion okay anything else

00:13:51,310 --> 00:14:01,320
don't a little more cookies next time

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,440
you just want your cookies J don't you

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,380
you take general feedback it will come

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,330
up after yeah thanks alright I'm gonna

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,260
move on

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,940
so the negative society without Tom gave

00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,710
me too much credit without these other

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:21,340
guys this would have been impossible

00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:25,630
okay it's a very it was a tough process

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:34,710
this time so thanks Tom

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:38,950
Thank You Pablo and to our speakers

00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:40,780
excellent talks I think everybody it's

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,870
very difficult to have two tracks in

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,150
this conference it's never I want to

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,810
attend all the talks I think I didn't I

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:51,550
missed half a talk somewhere but I you

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:56,380
yeah we have a variety of people low

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:59,470
level TCP level XD p BP F is sometimes

00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,860
there's no intersection but I enjoy

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:09,250
every I enjoy all of them so we'd like

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:11,980
to maintain this single track and the

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:15,340
papers please complete those and submit

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:19,090
them it's it becomes a historic record

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:25,030
for you as well that you you worked on

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:28,000
that topic our attendees so yeah we were

00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,980
hovering around 160 just like before 21

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,390
countries now we don't ask people to

00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,550
register which countries they came from

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:36,430
so we guess from their addresses

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,310
sometimes and people I've seen somebody

00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,820
who enter the country I think what do

00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,750
they say

00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:46,510
get back or going No

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:49,270
so we'll probably add a column which

00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,480
says country right as opposed to the

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,720
address so we have 21 countries from 160

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,210
sorry 21 countries 160 people we have

00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,550
about 30% local representation people

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,110
from Montreal and the neighborhood and

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,860
for the first time we're experimenting

00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:09,340
with remote participants you saw a

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,160
presentation this morning from - sure

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,690
Dave I I'm not sure where he is

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,660
but doesn't matter and you saw Eric

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:22,570
contributing to the meeting he's the TCB

00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,130
maintainer thanks to cumulus or which

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:25,960
will in a very short notice

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,610
was able to set us up with that I'm

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,580
sorry not all Google products are very

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:35,590
good we didn't want to use hangout and

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,870
and zippers here for the first time we

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,480
had a dog in the car that had a badge in

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,240
the conference I know if you saw him but

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,370
he was watching closely he only barks if

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,960
he likes what you say right and t-shirt

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,830
this way I mean it's not complete

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,560
without this right however this was what

00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,150
it was in into to look what when I when

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,610
I play this real fast you'll see the

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,610
blue shrinking in yeah oops

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:14,480
huh so both was about the same I was

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,670
just showing that you guys are on dad oh

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,670
[Music]

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,980
dang

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:30,100
okay I was excited when I saw it all

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,340
right that's it you spoiled okay so

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,720
feedback now it's general feedback we I

00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:36,610
got I got one feed knocked by somebody

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,460
who left that said it was meaningless to

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:43,060
just have a nickname like a with a ring

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:46,780
on the top or or a clever name like that

00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:49,600
or scanf those two names or mission to

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:51,550
me so the idea they say that they'd

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,960
rather have for the newbies you have a

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:58,020
full name so they know who you are

00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:02,170
right that was one feedback I got

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,630
definitely the papers was another but

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:11,650
now we can open the mics to have general

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:13,810
feedback question tomorrow yeah maybe I

00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,540
didn't get to the last couple of not

00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:19,360
those I was just curious they used to be

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,310
doing two per year and then and I

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,440
remember in January trying to figure out

00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:25,150
where net dev was gonna be in March and

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,100
right it's like what's going on what's

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:31,540
going on and then I then you you told me

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,000
today and that was cool but is it going

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,550
to be one per year now do you know where

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,830
the next one will be etcetera

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:41,220
well the next one is kind of a secret

00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,320
right now but yes it's about we'll do it

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,940
every eight months right because six

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,050
every six months was too much for some

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,700
people because they attend either

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,460
conferences other an interesting

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,650
conferences but so eight months seems to

00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,930
be a bit reasonable I should say that we

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,520
intentionally co-located with the ITF

00:18:54,930 --> 00:19:01,130
we've got a cross-section of people from

00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:04,140
the ITF somebody was complaining that

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,730
they had to go to the ITF they exhausted

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,820
by the time they go to our conference so

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,160
we adjusted based on their feedback so

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,230
it's before the ITF and we hope to do

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:18,020
the same the next one you may guess

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:20,910
where the next IDF is then yeah okay so

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:24,270
yeah thanks for coordinating thanks for

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,830
hearing my complaint no like it would be

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,510
great if you can put the slides online

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,100
as well because sometimes it really

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,310
helps to look those lights during the

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,840
procedure you know we went from in last

00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,460
three months there was no calm the

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,150
conference call went from zero to

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:41,550
completion in three months from papers

00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,410
being accepted about a month before the

00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,090
conference so we will put by next week

00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,430
we hope to have everything apply online

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,290
and now the more complicated request if

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,270
you could get the agenda online a little

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,130
bit earlier that would also be hell so

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,960
we have eight months so one of the

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,470
process things that we have to discuss

00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,340
and maybe will clock will announce the

00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:04,590
call for papers much sooner and we will

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,810
probably close it without accepting any

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:08,730
papers is an ongoing process of

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,490
discussion right now we may close it

00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,840
before not a month before because that's

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,580
you can't announce a schedule if you

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,100
haven't issued a accept all the

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,100
acceptances but that's that's good

00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,660
feedback you you think that people plan

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,790
their trips three months ahead of time

00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:30,090
we always the two weeks was enough no

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:32,820
six weeks okay okay just on that point

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:35,460
yeah if you're traveling internationally

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,100
and if you need a visa to travel then

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,250
yes three months is about right okay

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,050
okay

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,020
something that we discussed offline

00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,830
feedback when we submit the papers and

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,690
in the ideas

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,679
automatic feedback that we send it to

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,850
the right address and everything yeah

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,950
that's the stuff that Alexander is going

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,210
to be working on he just was too short

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,220
we didn't want to disrupt anything in

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,870
case there was a bug then things stopped

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,399
working

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:11,950
but he's gonna work on stuff like that

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:16,690
okay any other comments okay so net dev

00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:19,450
next oh okay yeah

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:21,940
really enjoyed the academia contributing

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,100
to LA Linux kernel I hope that thing

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,350
continues I mean I know the negative

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,559
feedback but the positive part is like I

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:33,370
seen this a first time so I hope that

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:35,590
you guys can do yeah III really enjoyed

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,450
it as well I mean as long as it's

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,100
related to linux right don't don't just

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,370
put formula the calculus the end in this

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:44,169
don't you have to have an implementation

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:48,279
then it's acceptable right and we

00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:51,789
encouraged I liked all the talks that

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:54,990
came out of academia this time I my

00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:59,409
personal bias I liked the MIT talk a lot

00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:01,090
okay so native next I guess some of the

00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:02,799
ITF people will probably figure that out

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,460
in eight months is gonna be an ITF

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,880
somewhere it's going to be in Europe

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:12,029
the location is Prague praha how do you

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,800
obviously there's a product or prob

00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:17,670
yeah

00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,960
or both are correct in other words right

00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,960
okay well that's it thank you

00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,750
[Applause]

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:41,470
