Title: Netdev 0x12 - Kernel TLS handshakes for HTTPS DDoS mitigation
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	KTLS focuses mostly on zero-copy data transfers and only offloads encryption and decryption and ignores TLS handshakes.
However, TLS handshakes are susceptible to DDos attacks which are very effective at depleting resources.

Alexander Krizhanosky described Offloading Kernel TLS handshakes to counter HTTPS DDoS mitigation on July 13th, 2018, at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal.
