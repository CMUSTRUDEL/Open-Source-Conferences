Title: Netdev 0x12 - DIM: Generic Dynamic Interrupt Moderation library
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	DIM lib is a net driver independent framework for dynamically tuning interrupt moderation recently merged in 4.16 and used by several drivers. It exposes an API which any driver may use in order to optimize its throughput, packet rate, latency and interrupt rate.

In this talk at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal on July 12th, 2018, Tal Gilboa went into details of the DIM workflow, algorithm used, how to integrate into your driver, and last but not least performance benefits.
