Title: Netdev 0x12 - LSDN: Manage complex (virtual) networks in cloud env with Linux kernel facilities
Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	In this talk, Vojtech Aschenbrenner presented LSDN, a tool for effortless management of complex (virtual) networks at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal on July 12th, 2018.

Often management of virtual networks has dependencies on complex infrastructure orchestration tooling - encumbered with long running agents like OVS etc. LSDN has no external dependency on
any such tools and leaves no agents running thus not only improving usability but also robustness of the operations.
The tool relies entirely on the functionality provided by the Linux kernel, mainly on the Traffic Control (TC) subsystem with its recent features.

Vojtech described LSDN features and challenges faced in its development (and how various kernel and iproute2 issues were addressed); then delved into how to write applications centred around the offered C-library and backends. Vojtech concluded by talking about the future plans for LSDN.
