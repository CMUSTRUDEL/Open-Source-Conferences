Title: Netdev 0x12 - IPsec IKE tutorial lab
Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	If you have ever been intimidated by IPsec or always wondered what IPsec is and/or how IPsec datapath works in the kernel or how IPsec control path works in user space, then this tutorial is for you.

Sowmini Varadhan and Paul Wouters guided us through the theory and walked through the steps for setting up IKE/IPsec on VMs on our laptops. A number of other VMs were be made available as targets to connect-to for the different IKE scenarios via Libreswan. These scenarios included some commonly encountered roadblocks that are used to teach IPsec troubleshooting issues.

This tutorial/lab was presented at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal on July 11th, 2018.
