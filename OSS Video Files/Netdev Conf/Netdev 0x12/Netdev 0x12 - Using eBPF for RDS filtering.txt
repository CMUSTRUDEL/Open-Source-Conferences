Title: Netdev 0x12 - Using eBPF for RDS filtering
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	On July 13th, 2018, Tushar Dave shared his experiences at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal, in implementing Reliable Datagram Socket (RDS) filtering and firewalling. RDS sits on top of both TCP and IB, which presents a challenge:
while TCP deals with skbs, IB/RDMA deals with scatterlists. Traditional firewalling with netfilter deals only with skbs. Tushar was looking for a
unified solution for both TCP and IB.
To this end he was adding/extending eBPF helpers to process messages that
are in the form of struct scatterlist.
