Title: Netdev 0x12 - QUIC: Developing and Deploying a TCP Replacement for the Web
Publication date: 2018-08-01
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	Is TCP - at 44 - too old, slow, and have bad habits that can't be fixed?
Does shaving a few milliseconds of latency on a web transaction matter that much to call out for a new transport?
The new kid on the block, QUIC thinks so. QUIC has been globally deployed at Google on thousands of servers. If you are running chrome as a browser and using YouTube, you are likely using QUIC. Estimates are 7% of the internet traffic is now QUIC.

In this talk, Jana Iyengar and Ian Swett provided an overview of QUIC, its motivations, and the performance improvements observed at Google. They discussed performance bottlenecks in Linux kernel UDP that were seen at Google's servers, what was done to overcome them, and what work remains to be done in the kernel as QUIC becomes more widely deployed.

Presented on July 13th, 2018, at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal
