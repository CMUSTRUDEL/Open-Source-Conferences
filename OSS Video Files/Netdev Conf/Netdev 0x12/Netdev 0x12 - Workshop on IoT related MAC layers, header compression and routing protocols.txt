Title: Netdev 0x12 - Workshop on IoT related MAC layers, header compression and routing protocols
Publication date: 2018-07-31
Playlist: Netdev 0x12
Description: 
	On July 11th, 2018, Stefan Schmidt chaired in a working session with face to face discussions on IoT related MAC layers, header compression and routing protocols at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal.

In no particular order the agenda roughly covered:
- ieee802154 and 6lowpan subsystem status update for the last kernel releases
- Defined a userspace API to configure 6lowpan header compression options
- Discussed what needed to be done for an ieee802154 hardMAC extension to the stack
- Improved test coverage with hwsim, tdc, scapy & TITAN
- Thoughts on software fallback implementations for ieee802154 CSMA and AACK
- Thoughts on a LoRa subsystem (with SCHC addition to 6lowpan) for Linux
