Description: 
	Suricata is a widely deployed open source IDS/IPS/NSM.
Suricata 4.1 will include eBPF and XDP support. In this respect, Suricata is amongst pioneers to deploy these technologies in a production environment. The journey to get to eBPF and XDP support and remove the cobwebs took about 2 years. Eric Leblond described on July 12th, 2018, some of the challenges met and how they were addressed to get to production level quality at Netdev 0x12 in Montreal.
