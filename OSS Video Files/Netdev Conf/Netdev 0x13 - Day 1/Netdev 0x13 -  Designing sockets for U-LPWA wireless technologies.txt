Title: Netdev 0x13 -  Designing sockets for U-LPWA wireless technologies
Publication date: 2019-05-20
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 1
Description: 
	Andreas FÃ¤rber created a design to bring LoRa PHY sockets
into the Linux kernel, with LoRaWAN MAC layered on top.
As he interacted with other LPWA or WPA network technologies
stake holders it was natural for more discussions
to surface.

This talk gives an update on where the discussions
have gone for LoRa, FSK, etc., with focus on netlink
layer, protocol families and socket addresses.

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,549
[Music]

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,139
[Music]

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:39,140
strangers the main technologies as far

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:46,850
as my subjective impression is from this

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,850
has been very much because people

00:01:56,010 --> 00:03:01,920
which is

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:44,599
there's different types of transceivers

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:46,730
for technology that I'm working on on

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,010
the very far right side there are some

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,530
transceivers that have integrated micro

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,010
controller in those cases they will not

00:03:51,530 --> 00:04:00,790
talk about so that is not relevant to

00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:03,890
this topic but otherwise there are are

00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:17,440
refined now it doesn't drivers in the

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:27,470
works when it relates to your based

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:39,080
controllers and then the winds change

00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:44,750
the year Essex 12 776 1301 38 which is

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:47,479
used to basis devices based to guess

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,150
here I have to admit that I equated this

00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:57,320
determining the box to the middle model

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:59,630
- this is using pretty much a simple

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,460
that chipsets for and then first of all

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,950
science in this case there's the more

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:09,130
CPU to verify whether it's connected by

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,130
USB to whatever system

00:05:31,800 --> 00:06:35,490
and concepts like spy and service as

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:40,409
well as new system specific to as well

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:47,750
as works and then we have network

00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:47,750
interfaces and

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,880
almost none of the technologies that

00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:59,660
we'll be talking about here today on his

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,260
budget so there are like some truth to

00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:08,360
concept people have tried to do 6lowpan

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:19,640
viable but in most cases those are other

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:25,610
forms of freedom now this is hopefully

00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:28,670
to initiate some discoveries in that I

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:34,430
was curious whether there is any

00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:38,300
precedent which may have a situation

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:41,600
where you have it's reality of red max

00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,640
and soft max not just as places

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,700
depending on the chipsets are aware for

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,700
example this wireless travel with the

00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,730
yes but in this case and sometimes we

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:05,990
have modules that allowed to both the

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:11,090
raw as well as for now because we don't

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:20,390
have like the contrary to this we don't

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:32,250
have to be very specific but it's the

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:34,830
question like what ways of actually I am

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:41,550
let's get myself here so this is basic

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:44,700
water so when we have the ability to

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:47,220
have both type of right back and

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,740
software communication how do we deal

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,800
with that currently 92 lit by always

00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,810
forcing the lower level of communication

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,660
so that we could have the standard

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,570
software on top of that as if there were

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,540
no such more available but there might

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,840
be reasons to not always do that wave

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,770
and therefore the question is what is

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,770
the best way to do

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:37,440
you if it's possible to recite the

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,120
question because it's not clear for me

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,920
the challenge between the two options I

00:09:39,120 --> 00:10:31,320
mean what are the gains the pros and

00:09:40,920 --> 00:10:34,110
cons between its security for that to

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,780
switch the most is and the question is

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:41,670
probably actually that in the Knitting

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:44,370
bias networks obviously obviously one

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,839
device will be down in order to mix the

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:53,900
sheets anyway but and so this was

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:53,900
another idea that I was just

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:26,639
we need to ask some questions because I

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:30,430
don't know the protocol well enough so

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:33,220
is laura1 a superset of loris or does it

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:37,300
just add functionality or does it okay

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:40,120
so in theory you could also have a

00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,420
device that operates in both modes at

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:47,670
the same time so just theoretically

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,670
speaking not not whether the hard way

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,070
[Music]

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,920
okay so in that case I have a fifth

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,750
suggestion for you to add to the

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,959
possibilities to implement this which is

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:20,410
you could just have a separate Laura one

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,260
device that stacks on top of the Laura

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,730
device just like a VLAN device or

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:29,380
something works on the other end layer

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:32,019
and you could also have a extra well

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,660
Hardware offload support so to speak so

00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:36,399
if you add the Laura one device on top

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,250
of a Laura device that has hardware

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,600
support for Laura one you just go to the

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:43,300
driver and the driver on the Laura

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,880
device registers the appropriate API and

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,529
you can just directly pass down the

00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,300
Laura one stuff and for anything that

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:51,519
doesn't support Laura one you have a

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,430
software implementation that is provided

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,920
by the layered device on top of the

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,279
normal Laura device so that is what I

00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,279
would do

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,689
with devices so you have two devices

00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:14,069
here again I repeat that when we're

00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:26,489
dealing with modules which is the make

00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:29,910
of this right here actually you would be

00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:32,489
able to use both at the same time so the

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,850
the Laura Wan device would be a layer on

00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:43,499
top of the Laura device and unless there

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:46,350
is something in the driver or I guess in

00:13:43,499 --> 00:13:48,029
the Hartman case it might be a hardware

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:53,339
limitation that you can't use the Laura

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:55,170
device anymore exactly so I guess you

00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,420
could prevent a Laura device from being

00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:59,009
configured or you could just say carrier

00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,079
down or something like that in that case

00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:18,389
that that is not something that is

00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:21,059
easily handleable but in other cases

00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,819
where devices are layered on top you

00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:28,259
expect the lower layer to be up for the

00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:30,779
upper layer to be up so but I think the

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,489
maybe you can just say carrier down on

00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:34,019
the Laura device so it's up but doesn't

00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:36,929
have a carrier and the Laura Wan device

00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,470
has carrier up so it looks like the

00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:42,439
Laura device doesn't have a link so like

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:47,220
like the Internet port is not plugged in

00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:49,649
it's well I'm not sure what the rules

00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,360
are for carrier propagation but I would

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:53,819
be more comfortable with messing with

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,100
the carrier State then I am with messing

00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:58,379
with the link-up State so I would prefer

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,989
to have the Laura device be up but not

00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,059
have a carrier over it being down while

00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:04,829
the next upper layer device is actually

00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,730
up so that that seems to be more of a

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,730
breakage to me

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,280
Victor your initial question about

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:21,180
sotnik versus hard make similar issues

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:27,150
we have an normal Wi-Fi for example a

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:32,760
th9 key there are issues with encryption

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:38,610
sometimes and so on so there is a model

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:41,970
option no have a crypt which has so

00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,220
meaningful default it means well if it

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,250
don't trust have a hardware encryption

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:49,770
then it just disable it by default and

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:54,780
if you still want to play with it then

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:58,590
use it as optional module parameter but

00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:01,620
well sometimes too much options are not

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,520
so meaningful I mean as a normal user

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,150
you don't have no idea why is it is it

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,460
broken

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,910
if encryption is broken well then why do

00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,250
we have this options at all so why

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,730
should we enable it and if it's not

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,760
broken then let's fix it if there are

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,809
some small issues

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,809
[Music]

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:34,810
I assume that in some cases were some

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:37,380
devices have different roles like I mean

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,410
you have a gateways and EndNote EndNote

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:43,150
for if you for instance have a

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:47,650
preference to live to the laura1 I

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:49,440
assume implementation because in some

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,770
cases they would like to have end-to-end

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,610
application semantics so to send them

00:16:52,770 --> 00:17:03,070
bite the receiving Laura one server

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:04,780
receiving that so I assume that we need

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,390
some kind of document describing

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,579
visionary the users user base scenarios

00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:14,589
and figuring out which of those choices

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:17,760
have meaning in some cases you might end

00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,100
up with a one note that you'd like to

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,130
upload data to throw a gateway so you

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,020
have a lot of one and maybe can send

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,980
something different all the same

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,650
information to a remote node but as you

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,730
said before this is not a typical choice

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,340
so it depends on how I mean at the end

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,430
of the day how many unit tests are you

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:46,060
going to write down for figuring out

00:17:41,430 --> 00:18:05,530
what is the correct usage of of your

00:17:46,060 --> 00:18:07,750
software so yes like Laura as a device

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,310
you have floor awareness or device if

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,890
it's at support from the hardware and

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,770
once you figure out that for example the

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,600
lower band implementation of the

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,640
firmware is broken for some way then you

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,170
can say okay for this device I disable

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,180
it and use a software implementation

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,610
I would you have to decide that on the

00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,140
device by device basis anyway but having

00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,480
like two of them available would be a

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,400
good thing and then as David already

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,130
said so if you have problems that we

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,200
can't use Laura if Lauren has enabled

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,420
for example then we use like the carry

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,870
or something to this to not allow to use

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,870
it offset

00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,430
[Music]

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:53,710
I mean it's Laura defined for FSK and oh

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,870
okay so for all the different modes its

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,669
defined because I mean the notes can't

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,860
talk to each other if they're using

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:01,860
different modulations right so what is

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:10,059
from each other so they do not see each

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:19,770
other but in some cases they can be used

00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:19,770
with the they have a signal that says

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:32,900
in standby state and in the SEC West

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:36,530
stage that means if I switch for example

00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:39,080
my transceiver I have in my board two FS

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,200
k for example that's not possible to run

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,350
Laura on top of it I would have to have

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,390
my own complete Network I mean my stack

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,270
on top of that have to be defined on

00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,780
both sides anyway so I mean I'm not sure

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,910
if these notes that are not part of the

00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,280
law specifications are really worthwhile

00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,080
supporting in an additional state I mean

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,830
that might be something we want to have

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:05,840
later on in like in a subsystem which

00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,180
gives you more raw access to as a

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,100
fighter then you can do that but

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,750
initially I would just go with the law

00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,580
remote to have something that actually

00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,380
is supported and then can actually talk

00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:26,980
to all the devices around so I mean that

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:31,490
is just my own suggests if it's neutral

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,950
exclusive to have these modes so if you

00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:36,470
are in standby you are listening if you

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,780
are listening then you probably have to

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:44,180
decide am i listening on FSK or lower

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:46,430
mode yes then I think in the first

00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,110
implementation it's if you want to

00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,770
support switching out then you have to

00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:55,340
turn interface down configure the modes

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:57,530
preferably via net link then bring the

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,020
interface back up and if no our van is

00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:03,620
not supported on that modulation

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:08,150
technique you same interface cannot be

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:11,410
brought up so you have to you see oh see

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,410
it's a simpler mode

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:52,790
each other yes but you go and you switch

00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,890
if the interface is down because doesn't

00:22:52,790 --> 00:23:00,590
make does it make any sense to switch

00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:03,080
while transmitting yes then you might

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:07,340
need to leverage the discussion about

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:10,370
the neighbor cache where you attach

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:16,520
which mode I'm going to use with which

00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:18,610
neighbor but which mode would mode show

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:24,770
you switch to when you are listening

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:27,440
yeah that's a question so you first have

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,230
to figure out that is it the use case to

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,300
switch between modes while sending and

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:37,160
what data to use to discriminate or to

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:43,210
decide which mode I'm going to send

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,210
versus it based on target is it based on

00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:06,180

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,859
[Music]

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:40,820
during release about one of the use

00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:42,950
cases for using this different because I

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,990
was just wondering why we would actually

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,940
go to the hassle and think about that

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,490
and implement it if there's nothing I

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:52,990
mean it's just future thinking that can

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,990
be done in the future as well so there's

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,039
[Music]

00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,159
if you can do that that will be the

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,690
preferred way to just start for that

00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,630
because Laura would be the interesting

00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:25,640
part and then if there's really interest

00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,900
in embers for legacy applications

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,240
something that someone comes and wants

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,520
to work on that then we can rethink

00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,840
about that but just keep it a bit more

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,840
simple in the beginning would be good

00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:44,179
just side note on the K network we have

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:48,740
a bit right that needs to be common

00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:51,409
among all devices on the network and you

00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:55,909
can query the device over net link

00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:58,159
what's that capabilities and there are

00:25:55,909 --> 00:26:02,450
in general you can configure the bit

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,580
rate without within a certain range and

00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,500
some devices only support

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,320
spit rates and you can carry that and

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,990
you turn the interface down set the

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,730
bitrate and turn it up again and if

00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:18,940
you're in the wrong bitrate you cannot

00:26:13,730 --> 00:27:21,019
send a receive messages but there is no

00:26:18,940 --> 00:27:24,139
or something like this exist some in the

00:27:21,019 --> 00:27:26,000
sub 1 gigahertz something different in

00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:28,940
the collision awareness and detection

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,840
that's my some transceiver has some list

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:35,419
before we transmit that some different

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,500
because the counter II revelation are

00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:43,220
completely different and this only

00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,309
exists in the sub 1 gigahertz

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,440
I talked with Johannes back one time and

00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:54,460
he seems to be happy about to extent

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,460
somehow more information into the web TV

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:04,340
no no I'm not aware that somebody added

00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,019
this information but indeed it is need

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:08,019
to be extended more metadata information

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,950
[Music]

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,829
[Music]

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,000
quality of these radio transceivers

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,830
often have different modes available for

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,780
like I said legacy applications or just

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,700
some proprietary solutions for some

00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,860
vendors or something like that so I

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,720
wouldn't really go the whole way

00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,970
supporting all of them as long as

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,500
there's no real use case for that so yes

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:02,179
I mean if you have s ok for example

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,860
members coming up at some point that

00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:06,790
it's fair enough but for now I would

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,790
focus on something like Laura

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:18,540
from community today has they changed

00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:21,840
the course of the workshop yes presented

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:26,460
last year but bore a lot by now you

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,750
actually have this module and will

00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,830
probably need to have that as a

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:35,280
worldwide watching interface on top of

00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,350
our interface as we have discussed I

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:46,140
still need to learn how exactly this

00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:55,290
very skip that yes use be also one

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:57,780
metric issue and a recent development

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:02,700
earlier this year as a possible but not

00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:06,530
the protocol so there is once under the

00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:16,770
name sweetie Huy as a mic

00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:21,660
three-dimensional I have the situation

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:25,670
that I'm seeing it used together so I

00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:28,080
was exposed that functionality and

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:31,670
probably the easiest thing would be to

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,130
just have another people to into that

00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:37,400
device or integrates it works really

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:37,400
nice

00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:49,020
however the protocol is a symmetric

00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:52,370
compared to you too Laura so that

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,370
foreigner here the question

00:33:13,309 --> 00:33:21,110
like really physical cards you have to

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:21,110
put it to the divisor okay

00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,719
[Music]

00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,520
[Music]

00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:31,419
but it also has because

00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:41,860
so people are trying to say again on

00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:41,860
those she bites

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,480
music

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,140
[Applause]

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,180
okay so you are already a few minutes

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,830
into the breaks make it short so thanks

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,600
a lot for everybody coming joining us

00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,620
here thanks for the suggestions and

00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,380
hints

00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,180
I think the forum what was format was a

00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,970
bit better at this time do we have more

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,290
time for discussion in terms of just not

00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,860
just standing there and through the

00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,420
presentation so I'd like to build on top

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,800
of that for the next time that we can

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,000
actually have a bit more like a workshop

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,380
style and yeah great thanks a lot you

00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,790
all will be around for the whole next

00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,930
day so if there are other things to

00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:02,280
discuss you can do that just on the

00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,280
