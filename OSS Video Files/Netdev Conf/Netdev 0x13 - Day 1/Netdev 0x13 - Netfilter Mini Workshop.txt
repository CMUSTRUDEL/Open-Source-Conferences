[Music]

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,210
[Music]

00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,530
[Music]

00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:20,180
to make sure that conditional one

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,340
[Music]

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,460
after the redlining problems or retinal

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,310
and occasionally they are more expensive

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,500
than they used to be before so one thing

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:02,650
that we do not honestly moved one

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,650
indirect thought and functions together

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,689
[Music]

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:27,940
so I spent quite some time on trying to

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:32,480
merge directions where we can have

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:39,709
different routes to enter in some things

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:52,340
out any directions the base we can't

00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:55,820
because we started to any optimization

00:02:52,340 --> 00:03:00,220
the only reasonable exceptions resist

00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,220
because this integral reference

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,159
[Music]

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,990
[Music]

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,810
[Music]

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,930
once the water size was slower than

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,880
before all the models combined why

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,150
because we go with all the

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,910
infrastructure that was there to to deal

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:34,370
with dynamic registration they as we

00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:36,520
track us at one time because there are

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,520
no

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,290
[Music]

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,450
[Music]

00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:42,870
while silly because no statements at all

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:54,990
because just to find out that we are

00:05:42,870 --> 00:06:00,620
talking to what doing that prefer but I

00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:03,870
don't think it's back to the days when

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:08,660
defragmentation was connection checking

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,660
themselves separate it was

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:49,479
without exploring is just adding a small

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,860
invitation to the bass book that this is

00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,610
the defragmentation book and then a

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,610
small

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,420
[Music]

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,180
so what's to any cables kind of tables

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:33,739
has different intentions

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:33,739
[Music]

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:53,150
[Music]

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:45,209
I guess the ability was expecting the

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,209
number

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,820
[Music]

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,700
[Music]

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,630
[Music]

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:22,450
for one thing moving us to explore

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:25,130
whether from the - assess how the

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:28,210
container is used by

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,210
[Music]

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:16,059
[Music]

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:40,490
but some translation in German method

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,710
that was implemented we didn't get any

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,000
support of a mass for unit yet very

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:54,070
simple rule like masquerade everything

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:58,640
to maintain two tables for ipv6 but now

00:11:54,070 --> 00:12:01,430
that's fine and that support is actually

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,710
already working it's just market our

00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:06,220
screen so that should land in the next

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,220
week or

00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,390
[Music]

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:12,769
because that's the garage till which was

00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:15,410
originally has more than ten years ago

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:19,209
to work around switches hands you know

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,209
was identical a key address

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:30,040
[Music]

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,120
to the

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,039
[Music]

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,960
[Music]

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,130
[Music]

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,880
[Music]

00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,529
[Music]

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:18,290
connection drive in that and it's tables

00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:24,980
and I would also use a space rock

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:27,050
concert and table updates that have

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:31,189
happened in sneezes infrastructure that

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:36,410
was added last year in January actually

00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:38,269
just opened just repeating another

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:43,269
Sumerian recent work that I've been

00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:49,610
doing that is now upstream regarding a

00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:54,470
decremental an existing quality hardware

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,329
health infrastructure so in negative

00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,410
also negative not many things have

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:02,029
happened and we got a bit of dust on the

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,740
coat limiting structure there were

00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:07,270
patches coming from undeveloped during

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,270
summer after the workshop and

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:15,770
aimed to improve it to make a scale and

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,949
their heavy load but it turns out it

00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,870
turns out to be a few of the brisket

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,730
things that were actually this all these

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:25,730
plastics before that were talked about

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,370
by several users so we have to do this

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,340
like a rollback and adult a more

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:35,030
conservative approach such as 20 and

00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,049
also back for batches were stable trends

00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,960
also available

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:44,510
so hopefully this this problem is not

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,150
solved we addressed a few problems

00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,669
related to them namespaces basically you

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,660
have rules using the Raiders and the

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:55,929
pastorate

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,929
targets and the destroyed in a namespace

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,990
we're likely to eat kernels blaster so

00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:06,260
now this is also fixed and we also

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,870
updated the test infrastructure scenario

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:11,240
we also rated that party basically the

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:17,059
creation and namespace is filled with

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:19,070
different rules and removal when I visit

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:22,340
there is new mobile version 2 provision

00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:25,700
number 72 that's a replacement for this

00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:27,380
set socket option and get options that

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:33,200
have been traditionally in the interface

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:39,169
for ipv4 IP set and now is fully in a

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:42,669
database and is also attached that those

00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:46,730
users to match based on the

00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:53,000
correspondent of a magnet process for

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:55,929
packets coming from input path in the

00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:01,790
connection parking area will be college

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:02,250
we got a bathroom to follow this setting

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,250
up

00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,950
mark mark from the update path that is

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:12,880
Lucia who need to update just a few

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,040
things of the mind this was missing this

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,540
topic was already in place but it was

00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:23,410
not being used on that path then several

00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:29,430
updates on on location tracking later

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:32,320
time out in the GDP tracker is now

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:35,760
passing into a stream time out mode

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:40,920
after two seconds it is trying to avoid

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,920
what most investors oversee in each day

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:51,570
DNS requests 144 and one five three six

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:55,660
and this was making contract to enter

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:58,240
the straining timeout mode and then

00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:04,900
those entries are not addictive or in

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:10,290
case of the country is under stress also

00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:14,050
he has three default enough from 180 to

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:20,590
120 so we have a slightly smaller

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:23,410
default enough ability this new more

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,990
parents for contract they are not

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,500
useless

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,640
real history books in conditionally some

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:34,520
people are using an S contract for

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:40,450
network making for just to gather

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:42,550
statistics and is no problem is no fan

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:45,200
books are really sir

00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,610
because concert now a full producer

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,130
cooks all the if there is a hood that

00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:52,130
refers the state match or contract match

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:55,490
or in case of tennis tables any of the

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,110
spec extension that allows us to to

00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:03,020
match this table information that

00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:07,400
composition generates right so we've got

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:16,510
access for helpers there are people

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:18,830
usually we work best practice in

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,470
variation but it seems that there is a

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:22,910
new protocol version one user wanted to

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,580
update to make it work

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,960
so now it's there and then we are feel

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,270
personally before the signal for

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,110
instruction to the world a few a few

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:37,400
conan cases quite quite specifics

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:39,590
actually so I didn't either because it's

00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:46,340
going to take a bit of time but

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:48,830
information is available on the plane

00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:56,020
explained about moving all day direction

00:21:48,830 --> 00:22:01,240
in contact think on that we are ending

00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,240
have an hour the use of random

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:13,660
okay the deport offset so before we were

00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:17,210
using apparel Robert was named to the

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:20,150
last portal was tried to be activated by

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:22,520
but not engine this is not practical

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:27,340
these days anymore that was a sign of

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:34,310
the time that was running on the CPU

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:38,990
systems and 2015 a random call is been

00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:46,490
running together were offset and then

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:51,530
from there is into 128 times to get it

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:54,770
the first time that they all said it is

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,560
busy it's going to try to get another to

00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,720
come to another random offset and it's

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,980
in print the number of M student might

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:06,920
by two so it's it's reducing number of

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,200
the number of times a strange - parkour

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:14,120
- works of look at problems that have

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,500
been users also in Direction removal

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,950
that happen here the point is made

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:32,780
before and the merger of these 36

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:38,240
modules except for replacement is not

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:46,430
studied on the weakest of the cake but I

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:49,340
was able what happened is that the Yule

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,410
was evening building all handled so now

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,600
that is not happening anymore so again

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:57,919
we have

00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,639
so we made sure the handle that any new

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:05,269
rule that I started no matter if it's

00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:09,379
new or it's replacing always a new it's

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:11,960
a new handle but evening and there was a

00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:16,460
reptile day to change when they were

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:19,009
jumping to chain of going to tank when

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,659
wind rotational so if you had a vote you

00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:25,009
were reasonable that was where it was

00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:28,509
jumping to change it was leaking counter

00:24:25,009 --> 00:24:30,590
so that chain was not possible to be the

00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:34,669
inconsistent or anything company's

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:38,120
infrastructure allows us to use meanness

00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:45,259
tables maps and art form anything there

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:48,080
were a few that was internal death three

00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:50,149
years the match and target extensions

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,039
this is not happening anymore as you

00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:55,570
simplify this in the structure this was

00:24:52,039 --> 00:25:00,740
causing problems in environments with

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:03,620
namespaces taken new a new cover the

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,139
lease option that is also helping us

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,450
deal with the nature of this and any

00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:14,120
cover extensions what we do in unity

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,840
compensated for for masterson targets

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,840
from

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,790
extinguish life what we do is we

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,350
dynamically done dynamically

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:52,730
the operations of that is extension is

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:56,360
using different yes there were six will

00:25:52,730 --> 00:26:00,380
be optional chain counters if you use

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:04,160
the end tables infrastructure to load ID

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:07,810
tables rules and be able to have chain

00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:18,310
counters by default any tabletop

00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:21,710
so images I became an or statement is

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:25,280
comforting others were looking into

00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,250
aspects this thing there were party

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:31,850
Lewis last ones to specific usage we're

00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:34,100
not actually thankful annoying in the

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,020
beginning and the divers also among

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,020
courtney the rottenness a common

00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:42,230
replacement that could cause problems so

00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:47,240
that was actually a problem that is now

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:50,210
text yes there was a possible make

00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:55,120
indian systems with the text size a

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:58,700
stable industry offset using a 32-bit he

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:03,260
on a beginning system was not matching

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,580
and his property and I ran an actual

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:10,170
problems of

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:12,340
you know and and it busy airports when I

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:15,120
leaned several Bulls into once

00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,800
intersection and sending to the colonel

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,020
it seems that now you said our it

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,820
started to use the it's just section

00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,970
infrastructure to make dynamic

00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:37,030
to make any updates but frequently and

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:39,310
it was exercises more there is also now

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:45,780
many operation allows us to perform

00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:48,910
selective rule don't through netting

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:51,480
based on the table and also and on the

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:55,300
combination of the table on the chain

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,870
this is good because you have many goals

00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,810
justice number of entries that you pass

00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:04,000
through a net into even space we have

00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:08,770
phosphorus a who are the lookups the

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,140
safety of these people objects where

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:17,560
easiness nearest some users are heavily

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:21,550
is in the lead this new mystical objects

00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:24,250
and then searching for under tre move an

00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,890
object from a whoa it was taken long

00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:31,570
time try treating muscles of the capture

00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:35,830
but it's now text form a rush to make

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:44,200
way across from getting extensions from

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:47,470
the MC was poor and he attributed

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:52,680
anything attribute that also make

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,680
references to roll under

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,490
by the armour of the bathtub we are

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:02,840
sending and this is this is basically

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:06,380
fixed in the history where we send we

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:09,230
have a desert iptables restored users is

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,910
inhabitable restores including the

00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:14,809
position where they want to insert the

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:17,150
boat so if the position we first worked

00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:19,040
is already in the kernel in a stable we

00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:23,990
have an angle that easily identify the

00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,390
visual but in the case of that would

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:29,630
doesn't exist yet the kernel we won't

00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:32,360
have an internal ID refer to the rule in

00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,540
the batch that we can use to refer to it

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,940
okay so it's busy enhance ability

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,610
ability to make incremental updates

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:43,580
based on positions no matter if the who

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:49,940
is in the kernel or is coming in this

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:53,630
batch there is no match that allows you

00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:55,520
to the check is is what kind of

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,360
interface kind you have the people there

00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,510
are user users with missing an astable

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,429
with the DRF infrastructure and they

00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:09,950
must make sure the Sun was only applied

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:12,309
to the VRS play devices and they also an

00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:16,120
extension for the tunnel the tunnel

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:24,760
infrastructure to match on whether the

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:24,760
anomalies are at 4:40 texts from you

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:37,520
not since yourself in 2011 many many

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:40,820
fixes we also have things like learning

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,000
set flat is dynamic supply is signaling

00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:47,810
the kernel the user wants to update this

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:54,440
set or map from the backpack so this

00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:58,430
allows you to rules that can place an

00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:01,070
arbitrary number of selectors into the

00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:07,970
set that we construct on the packet

00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:10,460
whether information of information Latos

00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:16,400
an emotional option there are some users

00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:19,880
users want to create sometimes addresses

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,220
in using the using DNS resolver most

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,380
name is not practice because it with IP

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,910
tables that were it was called as

00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,060
sometimes people were going to the

00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:33,830
Middle East asking for thirteen base on

00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:38,360
Hoth names which is suggested users is

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:41,660
to create sets well exactly the same

00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,880
name of the host name and some some user

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:48,260
space demo especially played all sets

00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:54,830
hidden them with my dear Esther you get

00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:57,170
from the DNS resolution deep proxy

00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:01,910
support when team also meanwhile already

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:04,700
always be kept in support of SF in

00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:08,700
structure is very much better than their

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,980
browser every night table because if

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:17,940
craziness into the set map

00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:20,190
infrastructure and also we this video is

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,420
only training needs for infrastructure

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:26,220
to match them they say that information

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:31,500
now priorities are beautiful this

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:36,390
hospitals so if you if you're also going

00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:38,370
to see that if you're ready is if the

00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:43,140
apparently funny funny that it's like

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:45,750
this is one of the based priority is in

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,060
based priorities for close to one of

00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,430
those big priority is going to printed

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:54,330
on the name of that base priority plus

00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:58,550
or minus the awesome we then still

00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:01,380
disable that by using managed wine and

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:08,160
more updates in community inner tables

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:10,620
are we have restore services we were

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,990
catching these services internally ended

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,470
in the code fact coding them and there

00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:21,330
is no longer okay so now you can use the

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:24,450
DC services also tell work on on fixed

00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,280
for the jason infrastructure that is

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,840
available in minute tables and they did

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,760
uses big library table

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,810
another new features are the misspelling

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:40,020
suggestions so this comes the users

00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:45,480
sometimes misspelled the name of a table

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:47,820
chain and we are anything reporting but

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,800
it's simply trying to suggest a user

00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,620
what kind of think was who was not right

00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,560
in this case you you are trying to add a

00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:00,600
change that is chain for in tables

00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:01,240
filter filtering and it's like the

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,490
director

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,419
other death but it was not right because

00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:11,649
the table name is builder okay so and

00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:15,339
then the idea also for the in deep

00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:18,310
trouble now the quality or a poor man

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:22,629
day to use the space to match this

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:26,230
rubble and as they're before we have big

00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:30,010
match on their interface and whether

00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:32,260
input or called in place they don't

00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:36,399
money you naked syntax to replace the

00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:40,530
very busy tables some people refer to

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:43,089
meters as a way to populate a set or a

00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,859
set from the backpack we don't want to

00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:46,659
do that seems like anymore elect

00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:50,550
encourage listeners to use this new

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:53,740
sentence this new syntax is basically

00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:59,140
more natural because it refers to a step

00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:01,589
on that this is basically she does not

00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:05,470
define yourself in this case of cells

00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:07,810
export set the type of the 75 of

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,500
development that is said sports

00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:13,960
marketing for dresses and then here it

00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,700
is by an upper and upper limit for this

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,470
raw elements that is sets hands for this

00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,310
okay and then gives you the slack

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:27,160
dynamic that this dynamic flax tells the

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:33,250
crew know that this has in to be updated

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:37,810
comment then timeout the team of flag

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:41,530
and default right now because we want to

00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:42,599
expire after one hour and then the most

00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:45,960
busy look like

00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,239
like you see there is updating and

00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,759
experts else's referring to the

00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:56,039
expresses and this set is going to serve

00:35:53,759 --> 00:35:59,190
the destination addresses between the

00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:02,119
happy owner is a counter and this color

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,119
is a stateful

00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:09,690
object it's been to keep counting the

00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:13,859
number of packages are matching for a

00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:16,920
destination the final counter on the

00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:21,269
oldest is low contours of a field with

00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,279
that one counter where this nation I

00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:25,920
think for this nation addressed and one

00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:28,229
local counter for axial just by that

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:35,220
rule that's why we have two counters one

00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:40,489
of that we have custom compilation from

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:43,529
intimate support so you have to define a

00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:48,660
objective system object is called test

00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:53,729
TV and it's going to be useful for this

00:36:48,660 --> 00:37:01,529
problem and then Bob states mistake on

00:36:53,729 --> 00:37:08,369
that slide is me a tweet proto IP so

00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:10,349
that refers okay and then because it's

00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:14,900
been violet I'm ugly want to settle for

00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:16,880
this states of discrimination tracking

00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:21,099
that is the connection

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,819
should be easy to track at that magical

00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:28,490
time our party and there would be no

00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:31,750
reason inspector is that we probably

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:35,569
should be without the IP protocol etcd

00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:39,170
before a of them and then so every

00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:51,710
packet going to port it Sultan who will

00:37:39,170 --> 00:38:01,000
apply this time out in the lava rock she

00:37:51,710 --> 00:38:01,000
has been working hard on a new version

00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:11,180
[Music]

00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:13,549
there are almost now there were three

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,400
most different is that the conference

00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:20,660
and if one not that have been improved

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:26,029
in the director Barry train the new

00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:28,640
Melissa state as Tina not for children

00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:31,970
you have ability to support is support

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:36,380
it comes with a REST API Jason didn't

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:39,890
specify this presentation and there's

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,380
not made it deathbed infrastructure the

00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,990
updates are went into energy of being

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,170
art and basically these automatic gears

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:50,860
are configurations of

00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:56,200
is fetching my name information that it

00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:58,570
needs to configure psi if a state is not

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:04,000
been a supporter especially creating

00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:06,880
both from the ingress have to place the

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,790
packet in the mind of the packet using

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,420
the destination address the user

00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:16,300
specified and placing the pack in the in

00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:21,850
the in the need in important where it

00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:24,790
has to go porno passing with helpers

00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:26,650
example XP but all helpers of our

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:30,520
supportive and that filter not also

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:41,160
integrate into a nativity scene for all

00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:41,160
this there's no custom markets

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,340
[Music]

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,000
[Music]

00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:18,100
and infrastructure to integrate with you

00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:21,370
can establish relations and things and

00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:23,800
feel easy thing configure baby what

00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:30,070
selectors are using the couples will be

00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:31,960
a big load balancing yes and I'm coming

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,980
back to this I talked about this last

00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,990
time in

00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,720
this infrastructure and this flow table

00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:41,640
but talking to searchers so just to

00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,210
provide a bit of context for those that

00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:52,010
were not attending last conference this

00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:56,430
particular palette is in January 2018

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:58,500
and it works like this so basically the

00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:01,860
classic boarding pass that packet all of

00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:04,320
the dances when I kick same is ingress

00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,240
rerouting then roughly decision but

00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,180
let's assume that this packet is means

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,670
before also then we fold it for chain

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,470
and then after that before for robbing

00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:17,130
and then the question of the packet

00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:22,080
through namely s-mint that's the classic

00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:24,150
holding back so there the flow table is

00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,120
- pretty sure this flow table at the

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,830
egress open and the necessary Interscope

00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,050
so what we are going to do is that when

00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,120
the penalty kicks in we are going to

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,580
check our ingress if the if there is an

00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,910
entry and as multiple as much in this

00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:40,980
package there is no entry matching ahead

00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:43,260
and do that this packet go through the

00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,330
classic Ottoman disparagement for

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:50,550
interest rubbing organization forward

00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:51,750
push falling as me and then the next

00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,820
packet going in the opposite direction

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:59,430
that makes the connection 14 entry enter

00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:02,970
the statistic is going to get sick again

00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:06,470
again ingress we're in the janitor is

00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:09,870
mention a low table testa okay both

00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:13,440
providing modernization forward and ante

00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:17,670
for taser a rule that says flow also

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,809
that is going to say I want to I will

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:23,059
serve pain loss to the place

00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:27,109
it's being audited by default is wholly

00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:30,229
going to match for clothes that are in

00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:31,910
established state okay so in this packet

00:42:30,229 --> 00:42:34,219
coming in the illusion addiction is

00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:37,009
going to match because it may confer

00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:38,660
entered established state so it's going

00:42:37,009 --> 00:42:40,670
to match this whole and this one is

00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,759
going to add a new negative voltage so

00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:46,160
the next packet no matter if it's coming

00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:48,069
in the prior of the other direction it's

00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,809
going to final entering the building

00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:54,519
but let's continue with the second part

00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:59,029
coming in the radiation okay forward

00:42:54,519 --> 00:43:01,670
forward chain was robbing trust me

00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:05,269
happening okay and now this third packet

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:08,390
is going to get into the ingress book it

00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:11,209
will reach the flow table and it will

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:19,039
find anything floating in the state we

00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:21,709
have and then it's a suspect

00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:24,380
first half expecting the the classic

00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:27,469
warden hat and this packet in the flow

00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,529
table we are touching the ground and we

00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:33,709
are also catching the report that we

00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:38,209
have used last time to tune to place

00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:42,709
this packet out to tracking this back so

00:43:38,209 --> 00:43:45,410
then then this packet is going to be

00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:48,049
send to the transmission path so the

00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:50,970
fact is not going to be seen for from

00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:53,250
the Creveling forward and

00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,380
is visited by passing this neck so there

00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:58,050
is all that is when this is being

00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:02,069
describing you know being slightly more

00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:04,380
detail so for each packet we extract a

00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:06,510
couple with the lookup if there's some

00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:10,530
mess with at the back of the car in fact

00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:12,630
if they hit that's probably more so what

00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,190
is going on is that we attach the route

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:16,369
so this whole thing because the floral

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:20,670
tape which is acting as a country and

00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:23,790
then very often at manually there was

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:27,119
any kind of not policy the volatility

00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:29,430
detectives is not a nap both is going to

00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,490
be a plan and they are going to

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:35,420
determine this yeah and then you just

00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:40,200
place a packet in the campaign back

00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:44,930
exceptions are so far this trip he fired

00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:48,089
is over MTU with busted up to the gospel

00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,790
if there is IP options available we also

00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:54,990
funded to the gospel one person with a

00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:58,319
disability option that stuff is not we

00:44:54,990 --> 00:45:01,260
don't want to be nervous area when our

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:05,000
internal and so far and this edition we

00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:08,730
have is removing it is our informational

00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:12,350
information available the time we also

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:15,650
read positive slope Aven I'm British

00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:19,350
this time in the future

00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:22,920
in addition to that we will be only two

00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:26,460
exceptions pockets we have a garbage

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:33,240
collector flow table this garbage

00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:36,180
collectors nifty roughening estate - mr.

00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,670
State Examination business single time a

00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:41,940
so all entities of single time arteries

00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:45,540
update daily fantasy Empire so after

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:48,450
after a number of seconds in DMV has has

00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:50,240
seen no packets it expires and it is

00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:53,760
moved from the hall table

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:57,300
but still if we see that each be reset

00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,330
or in packets has also to the slow path

00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:02,160
and I explain you also this ignition

00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:07,410
that have been added participate

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:10,050
disappear down anything that I am going

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:14,640
to just show your CDs are simply example

00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:17,490
on how to configure a flow table and how

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,560
to the power would replace floating man

00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,690
in the floating they have to define a

00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:25,230
protocol option in scheduled for the

00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:28,080
audio test against any file where you

00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:31,080
want to hook this this flow table has

00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,940
been to me the ingress both in this case

00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,640
with so far better support the ingress

00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,700
pop and then you have to get specify the

00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,160
pre-renovation they changed much chamber

00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:44,130
this man

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,320
and they have to specify what if I just

00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:50,370
want to happen to be part of this logic

00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:54,930
we stated 8808 one single simple respect

00:46:50,370 --> 00:47:01,020
s and then the chain in the forward

00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:03,540
chain whose name is why all that says I

00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:07,200
be property CP so all these laws or TCP

00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:09,870
flows and we are going to be placed in

00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,890
the flow table as that by default the

00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:15,530
behavior is that the first packet coming

00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:19,140
into the protection

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:21,620
so the first packet makes contact enter

00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,300
the substrate is it going to match this

00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:26,120
okay that's something also that we are

00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,440
introduced we are going to blast through

00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:31,470
explicit configuration and I'm going to

00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,960
explain it in the next part from from

00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:37,200
when eating contra there in diseases of

00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,200
all time is also type system salsa this

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,560
metric is not going to disclose my

00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:45,930
beautiful adjusting actually disease

00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,510
aware that this is going to be seen from

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:55,800
the routing forward and patrolling

00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:57,690
change and the experience these are old

00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:04,140
I should remain time I think it should

00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:08,010
be slightly faster now and it is almost

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:10,320
three times faster in software that the

00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,859
cousin for what value was in the CPS map

00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:16,519
as much excise and well as

00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:25,969
benchmark is infinity and here just

00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:30,079
meaning getting extra from this auditing

00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:34,900
software okay so changes that went in

00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:38,329
and this dis are they updates since

00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:41,539
since last net that is today's nuclear

00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:44,839
town feature this here town feature the

00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:47,380
first line are the CCP and reset at this

00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:52,099
meeting pallets here down means that

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:55,579
please get this float back to the

00:48:52,099 --> 00:49:02,930
classic forwarding path because we want

00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:04,940
to do more inspection also this is

00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,880
usually she could be used by the by

00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,609
users from netting from Kentucky's coal

00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,729
is not debatable I said before

00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:16,069
so once to recover this frozen was one

00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:17,809
support flows to go back to blackboard

00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:20,749
in fact it's something that should be

00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:26,769
possible to be done making by flushing

00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:29,599
the flow table they fix that when in for

00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:32,539
definition of softener and is nation not

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:50,839
working properly so if not was working

00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:53,900
itself have promised in case that we

00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:57,229
have we didn't have one when a named

00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,460
namespace removing entries from the

00:49:57,229 --> 00:50:01,520
small table that

00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,990
Oh actually so now we have Jinyu that we

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,780
remove entries from the garbage

00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,880
collector that actually are all the

00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:13,220
businesses based it's also another

00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:16,010
picture of interaction with vrm and also

00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:23,390
the dragon with health barriers when

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:29,950
users use the contractor not turn that

00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:32,780
turns on the fiancees helper hoper

00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:38,510
automatically as a man that is now the

00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:42,559
simple mistake and now also want to

00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:44,390
change the route the ESP is structure

00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,369
that was cashed in the flow table was

00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:50,030
not attached to the same package is now

00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:52,280
attached because some some drivers they

00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:55,460
need this thing they did with this

00:50:52,280 --> 00:51:01,550
nation the grout to be in place and some

00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:02,990
anywhere according Grafton edges so this

00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:08,089
protein with the structure will move

00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:12,349
behind the eye where the typical

00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:13,940
hardware infrastructure the

00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:17,630
infrastructure this will be going

00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:21,290
outward so this big Hardware usually

00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:22,109
comes with is both tables and the ideas

00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,890
that you can

00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:28,230
this flow table so the hospital ability

00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:30,660
thanks to the match that are much

00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:33,150
indebted there so this is hyper if your

00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,739
table contains what kind of money you

00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,839
want to performing them or in them talk

00:51:34,739 --> 00:51:41,039
now or the station what you should use

00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:47,779
for this that is depending on where the

00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:50,609
agent is okay so so this is disinvesting

00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:52,559
providing any it's a software

00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,509
presentation that maps to the to the

00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:59,489
hardware disorders nation anyway is

00:51:54,509 --> 00:52:01,920
still faster than the company password

00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:04,859
they have been set incentives for users

00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:08,670
to use a software implementation thing

00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:11,609
is you got to get more performance I

00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:14,489
also work on adding an infrastructure to

00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:18,420
support the hardware of those hours of

00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:20,549
work there is no more there's no driver

00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,640
using it so we can push it into the

00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:25,319
kernel and that makes them very sad

00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,109
you have to happen so if you develop

00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:30,960
drivers you have to do timing though the

00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:33,809
first priority is infrastructure so we

00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:42,359
give this King and all people are

00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:44,880
working on this is not so okay there yes

00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:51,150
there will be a lot of slack and this

00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:53,549
all of that this over flags which means

00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:57,900
misty enable by the user when the

00:52:53,549 --> 00:53:01,319
finding the here the flow table that

00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:04,980
will be included whose name will be like

00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:08,249
oh no so this means that the user is

00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:11,690
asking explicitly to use the hybrid of

00:53:08,249 --> 00:53:16,250
the features in the halbert's important

00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:21,109
okay so we need a user user decision

00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:23,540
this and that's all what Jesus has to do

00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:29,020
but it happens in that is that if the

00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:29,020
driver supports did this what happened

00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:36,470
the entries that are in the software

00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:38,930
flow table there is a tune of predicate

00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:42,109
race over those entries and the entries

00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:43,670
are not yet in the hardware I need to be

00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:47,840
planning in place in the hardware so

00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:49,580
that is a little time the packet will be

00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:52,130
flowing through the software called

00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,690
table before the driver has a chance to

00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:56,150
turn the spirit that talks to the driver

00:53:53,690 --> 00:54:00,619
Caltrans complete your DMV number and

00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:04,460
then the user will stop seeing is

00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:08,210
following the just following the

00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:14,080
supercut see yes it's actually brother's

00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:18,619
mostly around 200 nights of code and and

00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:20,869
then also in it's inside the date on

00:54:18,619 --> 00:54:23,900
what you do with the NBL and how to talk

00:54:20,869 --> 00:54:29,470
to the driver and reproduce it isn't

00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:35,359
enough or anyway

00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:37,970
once we have a microscope so in the

00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:40,369
virtual doesn't have any port the

00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:43,160
conference also will be talking about

00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:44,130
how to use default able to the structure

00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:49,590
to accident

00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:52,050
I detect some there's a patch that is

00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:55,320
being very very small 1 2 3 4 I am

00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:57,480
thinking it's already available we also

00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,130
need to relax one thing to accept the

00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,450
configuration for the flow tables that

00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:04,740
we need to see traffic in both

00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:06,930
directions and this decision what may

00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:12,210
because there are people who have

00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:16,590
concerns about swapping the idiots well

00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:19,200
table filling with with many entries so

00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:21,960
able to make sure anything that all the

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,210
entries are justified that are worth to

00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,830
be placed in the hall table are there so

00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:31,050
and then this was made to have a good

00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:33,510
default behavior for TCP entry so that

00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:36,540
there will be another plan that will say

00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:40,530
please deviate a flow table entry from

00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:43,650
the first packet you see without needing

00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:46,950
to wait for established state okay and

00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:48,900
then in combination with this - with the

00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:52,440
process of it available and is need more

00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,610
slack we can combine the flow table with

00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,950
right exactly

00:55:53,610 --> 00:56:01,140
- so so - we expect our information will

00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:07,040
be available we are just going to place

00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:12,330
them in the traffic pattern and then

00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:16,620
this year John frangie are already with

00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:21,740
are the updated data can they just get

00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:26,490
this nation the authority pate a choux

00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:29,390
so more updates have been also working

00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,390
there is known as

00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:38,350
yeah we'll be matching soon today quite

00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:42,880
ridiculous about the near future I'm

00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:44,440
preparing a pasta basically to use this

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,440
infrastructure that it's not very well

00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:50,920
actually so that we're a few changes in

00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,580
the in the hardware policy of the

00:56:50,920 --> 00:57:00,820
infrastructure in the kernels investing

00:56:53,580 --> 00:57:08,400
just 2% world darkness taking this to

00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:13,240
the problems the e2 and once I see on

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:16,690
user space and TC this netting base so

00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:21,760
the idea would be to unify the big coat

00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:23,770
in the driver for both fountains so the

00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:28,030
driver private office don't need to

00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:35,170
write a back-end for it too and then

00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:37,750
another one for TC flower so always we

00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:42,580
have an entire presentation that is this

00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:46,840
low intermediate condition IR so the

00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:50,380
idea is that each to and the power they

00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,720
will just state what they are making

00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:55,420
native representation to flow to the

00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,940
whole route object and this object is

00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,770
going to be asked to the driver so the

00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:03,700
driver no matter if it's coming from you

00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:06,340
to or TC flower is 20 configure the

00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:10,690
hardware in terminal intermediate

00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:13,590
representation for the FAA for a

00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,590
applause

00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:22,490
and so the token adopted the name is

00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:25,190
Lulu and then a state law would compel

00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:31,610
composed of a romance in a flow of

00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:36,220
action the flow match it's based on the

00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:36,220
ability tickling the structure so

00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,270
basically is named for these flower

00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:55,550
so you said you said what you want to

00:58:44,270 --> 00:59:02,120
match in the role during the makuhita

00:58:55,550 --> 00:59:05,060
are okay the basically contains the the

00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:08,780
exactly real data message to these keys

00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:10,490
and so the important thing here is that

00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,860
private day with a year the police

00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:15,110
activities detail infrastructure to

00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:17,510
check if there's a key tech-savvy and

00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:20,390
let's say for example existing source

00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:22,280
address that yes in that case I'm going

00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:25,700
to configure the harder to match based

00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:29,420
on day that before address and there's

00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:33,080
no accent well a number of number of

00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:36,050
actions depending on whatever can do

00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:39,250
community just one or the cupboard there

00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,250
is more couple and

00:59:53,369 --> 00:59:59,079
just interesting analysis in crane for

00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:08,559
different sense to provide intermediate

00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:13,329
condition to wolfing and they are going

01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:21,400
to popularity hardware intermediate

01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:24,609
representation that is to support action

01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:28,480
so far our we found what we would is

01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:31,900
available in already in between but when

01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,640
listening infrastructure the drivers are

01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:47,349
the we're supporting disease bloggers

01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:50,700
were converted to user and also also so

01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:52,990
this is what is actions are acceptable

01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:57,940
tracking if you want to pass it to this

01:00:52,990 --> 01:01:01,839
computer they also go to discredit me

01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:08,109
rate that create a can be read to to

01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:13,720
taste a an important Kimora copy and

01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:17,519
paste work typically four basic types

01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:22,559
not for the individual for inspection

01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:25,049
meeting in an actions are push of module

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,609
then

01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:31,140
actions are interrupted a or income

01:01:27,609 --> 01:01:31,140
today then

01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,179
[Music]

01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:50,650
however to return a check marking and

01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:56,369
then to new actions that are not the

01:01:50,650 --> 01:02:00,400
usual the usual seven actions are

01:01:56,369 --> 01:02:03,550
exposed already through dizzy flutter we

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:10,720
go now and you are just becoming related

01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:14,530
to in defense and here is this justified

01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:20,920
to experience what city you did you give

01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:24,300
this back to religion is a new structure

01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:27,579
obviously those we're using flower

01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:33,430
basically this and there are two two

01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:37,270
drivers Italy Starfighter the Surfrider

01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:43,059
to drive driver is not super duty flower

01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:46,000
is what each tool is using a function

01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:49,359
that translate they need to block into

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,970
the floor move object so now because the

01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,740
float will object to the function that

01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:57,609
populates the upper intermediate

01:02:53,740 --> 01:03:01,299
representation but therefore it should

01:02:57,609 --> 01:03:04,230
be easy to support this if I were to in

01:03:01,299 --> 01:03:12,880
the sulphide religion exactly same code

01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:16,329
and also the driver from Kilauea

01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:19,369
also this Brotherhood is again is

01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:24,970
it's it's implementing two different

01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:29,299
backends one for you and one for flower

01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:32,020
so so we continue to start already

01:03:29,299 --> 01:03:35,079
through removing lipstick we didn't stop

01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:37,590
moving or elevation and help the writer

01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:40,780
by release me

01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:40,780
[Music]

01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,939
[Music]

01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,559
[Music]

01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,429
[Music]

01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,829
[Music]

01:06:16,120 --> 01:07:13,010
yeah I mean this is a stage so we we

01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:16,540
need time to dismantle in there and now

01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,540
and of course

01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,870
when I see that

01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:11,159
when you decide to place it flow in the

01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:13,199
flow table it was in the neck in making

01:09:11,159 --> 01:09:16,380
decisions on the behavior what place

01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:20,130
interesting to captures and that was the

01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:22,920
problem and I think it's good I mean the

01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:25,259
spirits the user decides what policy

01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:28,250
want to avoid in terms of what wants to

01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:30,239
upload and also in terms of our uploads

01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:32,940
depending on the kind of or name

01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:35,670
depending on the hardware the number of

01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:39,330
entries available in flow table can be

01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:42,569
integrated not much so it's very stages

01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:45,679
you can do there is also a fan base on

01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:45,679
the hardware

01:09:45,830 --> 01:10:53,370
based on the back and forth then one to

01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:58,020
two packets cool drop because order

01:10:53,370 --> 01:11:01,010
connection which means quite certain the

01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,010
table and what

01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,259
[Music]

01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:07,659
you are you're decided to get these

01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:10,570
faster at the epoch of doing these

01:12:07,659 --> 01:12:13,210
things if you still have 12 that you do

01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:15,699
that you want to do full validation will

01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:17,760
do full tracking with the dragging all

01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:19,750
the features are available information

01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,020
for security reasons

01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:22,020
thank you

01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:26,830
it's that it's a user decision to do all

01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:30,700
this through poison

01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:36,340
this is dead and I think that this is

01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:40,180
right approach they should understand

01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:42,640
this yeah yeah we will extend

01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:46,530
communications with probably explain

01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:49,180
holidays and so you just understand that

01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:51,340
when they place blows in the code table

01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:53,530
these are actually relaxing all the

01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:56,469
security validation to be performed in

01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:59,440
the nation term that's one of the reason

01:12:56,469 --> 01:13:02,110
why we get it posted right because we

01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,440
are coming yes especially disposed

01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,440
things

01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,970
[Applause]

01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:19,620
yes any other person

01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,280
okay so then I think we can finish it I

01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,960
have a question within decibel chat

01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:34,380
every time I think you

01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,380
