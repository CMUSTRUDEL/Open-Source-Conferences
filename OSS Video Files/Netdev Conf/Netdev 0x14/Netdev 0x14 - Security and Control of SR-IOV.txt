Network kernel bypass is becoming more common.
Often the given rationale to bypass the kernel
is that it takes too long to develop and enable
the kernel for new features.
With bypass, the assumption that the kernel is
the central system resource manager no longer holds.
Multiple, independent agents try to independently
(and directly) use and manage resources.
The sanity and security of the system can be compromised.

In this talk, Carolyn Wyborny and Tom Herbert will look
at this issue with the perspective of SR-IOVâ€™s Virtual
Functions (VF); they will introduce the problems of control
and security in the context of kernel bypass.
Some potential solutions will be proposed.

Carolyn and Tom hope to initiate a community discussion
on the topic.
