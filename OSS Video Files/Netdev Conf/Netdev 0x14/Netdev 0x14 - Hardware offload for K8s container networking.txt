Kubernetes(k8s) Container Network Interface (CNI) is a specification for managing
network resources on a kubernetes cluster. CNI enables plugin-based networking
solution for containers ranging from IP address management to access control
policy management etc. Operators can pick and choose from the many packaged
and open implementations that exist or could create custom CNIs to serve their
needs.

In this talk Liel Shoshan describes how they approach hardware
network offloading in k8s and challenges faced.
They will illustrate offloading with a bunch of CNIs that can be used in
conjunction with OVS. In addition, they will also describe how to offload for
other K8s use cases like pod-to-pod intra networking and enhancing ingress
service load balancing via dp_hash.
