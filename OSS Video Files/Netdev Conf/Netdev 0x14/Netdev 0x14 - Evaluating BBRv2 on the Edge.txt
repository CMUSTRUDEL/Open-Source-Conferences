Alexey Ivanov will discuss evaluation of TCP BBRv2
on the Dropbox Edge Network. 

Alexey will dissect BBR design principles and discuss whether
the intended theoretical goals match real world results.
He will then dig into the BBRv2 design and discuss the intended 
improvements over BBRv1. Eventually, using practical examples,
compare the behaviors of BBRv2 vs BBRv1 vs CUBIC as applied to
an edge network.
