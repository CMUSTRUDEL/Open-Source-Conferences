Date: Wednesday, August 19, 2020

In this talk Sagi Grimberg will look back at the journey
and experience gained so far and set the context for the talk.
He will then build on that context to describe various experiments
conducted to measure performance  - more importantly the latency
achieved with current kernel NVMe/TCP. Part of the experiments
will explore different NIC vendors' features (Intel ADQ,
Mellanox aRFS, etc) that can be put to bear on behalf of
improving overall performance and latency.

And last, Sagi hopes to create a discussion based on some
suggestions on what he believes are useful enhancements that
can be made to the driver.
