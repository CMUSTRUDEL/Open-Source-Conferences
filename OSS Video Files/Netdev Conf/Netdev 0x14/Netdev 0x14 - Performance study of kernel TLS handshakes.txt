In this talk, Alexander Krizhanovsky and Ivan Koveshnikov continue
their quest(see netdev 0x12 talk) to investigate and improve TLS
handshake by moving it into the kernel. They will quantify how much
performance improvement one can gain for TLS handshake by exploring
an example of an HTTPS server moving into the kernel space.
