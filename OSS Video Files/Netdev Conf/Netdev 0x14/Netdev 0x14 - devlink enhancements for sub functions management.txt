New virtualization deployments call out for high density virtual
functions with more frequent lifetime recycling. Unfortunately,
PCIe SR-IOV has limited function count and large instantiation
overhead.  A solution to these challenges is to take a PCIE device
and "split" it into multiple subdevices. Each subdevice gets its
own virtual port(s), queues as well as named resources; Combined
with TC and switchdev offloads this approach overcomes the SR-IOV
limitations.

In this talk Parav Pandit introduces devlink enhancements
to manage such sub functions.

Parav  first discusses how devlink is used to life cycle,
configure and deploy accelerated sub functions with eswitch offloads
support. He then discusses the plumbing done using
virtbus to achieve persistence naming of netdevices and
rdma devices. Parav will also cover how such model
addresses smartnic use case where a sub-function NIC is
hot plugged in host system in a secure manner.
