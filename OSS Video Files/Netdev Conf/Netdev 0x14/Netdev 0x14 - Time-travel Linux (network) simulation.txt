In this talk Johannes Berg introduces a
mechanism to do "time travel" in User Mode Linux(UML) with a
virtual clock. One motivation for this feature is to test the
802.11 stack under Linux.

The time travel mode allows for reproducible testing at significantly
faster test execution times; as an example, on a relatively slow
machine:
two simulated machines in such a setup can simulate 61 pings,
at a default 1 second interval, in about 1.6 seconds real time
(as opposed to 61 seconds).
