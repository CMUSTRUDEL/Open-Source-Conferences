So you've heard of this new shiny transport called QUIC. You've
even been to several presentations on QUIC in 0x12 and 0x13. And you
are wondering how to write applications that run using QUIC
transport. Or ... maybe you happen to know that if you pulled apart the
Chromium tree, perform some tooling kungfu you could get QUIC infra
sufficient for you to write a client or a server...

Dmitri Tikhonov has a better idea. In this session he will
be giving a tutorial on how to write applications on top of
HTTP/3 QUIC based on the lsquic library.
The tutorial will start with a (very) short QUIC and HTTP/3
basics introduction followed by delving into the innards of
the lsquic library and leading to interactive coding of simple
echo server and client programs.
And more..
All the demoed code will be made available on github.
