In this moonshot talk Bar Yanai describes a clever way
to do efficient forwarding by introducing a TC hash action. 
An example use case of this feature is closely emulating what Equal
Cost Multipath (ECMP) based forwarding does. ECMP-like can be achieved by
enabling policy which will:
- First create a hash on a classical 5 tuple in hardware
- Use the resulting hash as a tc filter chain id and jump to that filter chain
- within the destination chain lookup a much smaller set of tc flower
rules (in the equivalent 5 tuple space) and execute the leaf action(s)
such as setting the next hop mac address, etc.

Bar will describe the suggested TC extension to define the hash
semantics and then delve into the challenges involved.
