In this talk from Maciej Paczkowski, Aleksandra Jereczek, and
Patrycja Kochmanska describe integrating into FRR
to understand how to best optimize the path selection in an environemnt
with multiple simultenous link faults and incestant link flapps.
Could routing decisions better helped with ML hooks in
the kernel/datapath? Could we make use of offloading some of
the algos to AI hardware?
