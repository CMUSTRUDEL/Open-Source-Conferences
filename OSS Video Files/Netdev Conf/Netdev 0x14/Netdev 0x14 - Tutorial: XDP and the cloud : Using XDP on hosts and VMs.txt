David Ahern gives a tutorial on integrating XDP in
a cloud deployment with VMs and containers.
The tutorial is interactive with source dissection and live demos
(with the source code available later from github).

David will look at the current state of XDP through the lens of
cloud hosting, discussing the advantages, trade-offs, and limitations
of using XDP on the host with the v5.4 kernel (latest LTS).

This tutorial covers:
- configuration of the host,
- walks through an L2 forwarding program,
- management of the fdb and device maps using bpftool,
- simple per-VM/container ACL via eBPF,
- XDP forwarding in the egress path, and
- using XDP in VMs running on the host.
