Lorenzo Bianconi et al will provide a tutorial on how to add XDP support
to a NIC driver. They will start with the basics and lead to the challenging
issues a driver author would have to deal with.
The mvneta driver (Marvell Armada 3700LP chip on Marvell ESPRSSObin board) will
be used as an example.
The tutorial will be interactive and dissect code samples while describing
architectural challenges.
