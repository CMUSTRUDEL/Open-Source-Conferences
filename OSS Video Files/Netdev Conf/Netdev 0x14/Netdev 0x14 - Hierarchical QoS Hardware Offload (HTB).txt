Hierarchial bandwith management is a very important packet
service in a lot of use cases (ranging from large data centres
to service provider use cases, etc).
Over the last decade, the TC Hierarchical Token Bucket(HTB) qdisc
has emerged as the most popular non-work conserving 
queueing disciple for enabling this service in Linux. 
HTB is quite flexible and versatile, but at large scale
(think hundred thousand to millions of flows) it comes at
a cost: 1) cpu cycles predominantly due to stalls caused by shared
queus lock contentions 2)extensive memory costs when adding many flows.

In this talk Yosef Kuperman focuses on offloading HTB to the NIC
hardware(Mellanox cnx5).
Flow classification takes place in the egress clsact to avoid any sorts
of (queue) locking. Packets are tagged and the offloaded HTB uses these
tags as flow/classids to select the correct queue in the hierarchy.
The authors will go over the challenges they overcame, show some
performance numbers and solicit feedback.
