In this TLS talk, Bar Tuaf discusses offloading of TLS to the NIC.
He starts by reviewing the life cycle of a HW
offloaded kTLS connection and the driver-HW interaction
in order to support it.

Bar then will present their experiments where NginX TLS
activity is offloaded to the Mellanox ConnectX-6Dx NIC
(using mlx5e driver). And finally their experimental results
which show significant performance speed-up gained by offloading
kTLS operations to the HW.
