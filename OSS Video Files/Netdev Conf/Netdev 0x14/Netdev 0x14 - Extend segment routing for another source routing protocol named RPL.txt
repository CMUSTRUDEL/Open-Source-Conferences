RPL is an IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks defined
in RFC 6550.

In this talk Alexander Aring et al will discuss an implementation
that uses "non-storing" mode (RFC 6554). While there are several other
RPL open source implementations, they all implement RPL using
the "storing" mode which propagates routes via ICMPv6.
In the storing mode, route propagation is done via the IPv6 Routing Header.
Aring et al discuss the architecture, interface approach, challenges that they
overcame and future work.
