So you have 100Gbps port and you want to do high performance
network testing for your shiny new Linux kernel feature....
Folks, your options are pretty much limited to expensive,
commercial equipment(we are talking hundreds of thousands of $$).
Or you could use Trex.
Watch Hanoh talk about Trex.
Trex leverages COTS x86/ARM servers and most modern physical NICs.

What can it do for your perfomance testing?
- generate upto 200gbps/100mpps advance traffic pattern
- millions of real world tcp/udp flows both stateful and stateless
  for testing packet forwarding and end servers.
- Millions of Connection/s (CPS) for flows
- etc

Hanoh will share the experiences they had to deal with when writting
Trex that apply to scaling Linux networking; he hopes to inspire some
of the techniques to be adopted in Linux.
