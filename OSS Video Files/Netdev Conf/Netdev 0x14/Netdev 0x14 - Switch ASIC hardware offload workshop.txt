Roopa Prabhu and Jiri Pirko chair the netdev 0x14 Switch ASIC hardware
offload workshop.

Network Operating Systems(NOS) based on Linux-native hardware offload
for network switching ASICs continue to gain traction.
Recent inductees includes the announced project DENT [1] that brings
together switch ASIC vendors, distributors, system integrators and users.

This workshop is similar to previous netdevconf switchdev workshops
with a larger focus on community discussions around building an
Open Linux kernel switchdev based Network Operating System.

          - Mellanox mlxsw driver updates
- New Networking features and use-cases
- Open issues and challenges
- New vendors
- Supporting new features down the pike:
      - Eg: EVPN-MH, port security, dynamic NAT and others
- Operationalizing Linux networking
       Automation and DevOps
