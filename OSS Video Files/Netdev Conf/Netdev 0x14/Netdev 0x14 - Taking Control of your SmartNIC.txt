SmartNICs are introducing a new paradigm in hardware
offload/acceleration - that of introducing additional
general purpose processors in the NIC. So visualize
the NIC as almost its own machine connected to your host.
Meaning you can, for example, move your control plane to
the NIC.

In this talk, Or Gerlitz and Andy Gospodarek start
by describing high level view of this class of NICs
They will then explore common common deployment methods
and models and help us understand this new class of NICs
 by exploring:

- what is out there in terms of networking open
  source code/features
- automation recipes and scripts to onboard
  software infra 
- common kernel offload techniques in use
- upstream kernel and distro SoC support

Or and Andy will iterate a few working examples
that are available for use across devices from
multiple, open SmartNIC vendors. They will also
discuss approaches of integrating into known
cloud orchestration systems like OpenStack
and Kubernetes.
