ADQ(Application Device Queues) support has been in the
kernel for a while now. ADQ enables network application
data to be isolated to specific (symmetric rx/tx) hardware
netdevice queue pair(s).
Application specific-data is ingressed towards these dedicated
queues and rate controlled in the egress direction - all using
policy definitions. ADQ uses standard Linux interfaces to achieve
its goals.

In this talk, Amritha Nambiar, Kiran Patil and Sridhar Samudrala
will:
- dig into the details of ADQ architecture and operations.
- illustrate collected data on how ADQ helps to improve
  predictability by reducing jitter, lowering latency and improving
  throughput.
- show, via an example application, how developers can take
  advantage of ADQ.

Amritha et al will also discuss future plans for ADQ such
as enabling busy polling on AF_XDP socket by associating a
NAPI_ID to an AF_XDP socket at bind time.
