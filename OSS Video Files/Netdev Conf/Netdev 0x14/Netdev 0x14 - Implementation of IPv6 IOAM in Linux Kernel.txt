Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)
refers to a set of techniques and mechanisms for performing
fault detection, isolation and performance measurements.
Classical approaches such are traceroute, ping, etc can now be
improved by collecting more granular and precise per-packet telemetry.
The IETF is currently in the process of standardizing In-situ OAM (IOAM)
to allow collecting operational information along a path.

In this talk Justin Iurman discusses an implementation of IOAM
for the Linux kernel with IPv6 as the encapsulation protocol.
They will discuss the details of their approach and demonstrate
evaluation results.
