In this talk from the Google folks Stanislav Fomichev describes how
Google has for many years utilized HTB and consequently faced scaling
challenges.
With the recent introduction of Early Departure Time model (See
Van Jacobson's keynote on EDT in netdev 0x12), an opportunity has opened up
to achieve the same packet service in a more efficient way. In this talk,
Stan describes how they moved away from HTB altogether.
The packet service is created using composition of BPF, FQ and
EDT. The authors will provide performance numbers, discuss some of the
outstanding challenges and solicit feedback from the community.
