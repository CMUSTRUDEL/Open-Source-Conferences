Being able to marry new Linux technology with existing "legacy"
infra is valuable to allow for continuity. XDP is a relatively
new technology introduced in Linux networking which enables
more efficient packet processing. A common desire is to allow
"legacy" packet processing functions to take advantage of the
speed advantages offered by XDP.
In addition to the efficiency factor, XDP also provides a
time-to-market advantage: new network packet processing features
can be added without need to go through the complexity of the
upstreaming process.

Toshiaki Makita and William Tu are still in pursuit of getting
openvswitch to use XDP. In this talk Toshiaki and William attempt
to marry OVS to XDP via:
  1. Attaching XDP from kernel through UMH (user mode helper),
  2. Reusing TC HW acceleration interface
  3. Attaching XDP from OVS userspace daemon

The authors will describe their approaches and challenges faced.
