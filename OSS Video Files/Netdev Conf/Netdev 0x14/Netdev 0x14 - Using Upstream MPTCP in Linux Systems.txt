The Multipath TCP community started its engagement with netdev conf
0.1 (https://netdevconf.info/0.1/sessions/16.html) and have shown
up to multiple other netdev confs after to solicit for feedback and
report progress. After all that hard work MPTCP has finally been merged!

In this talk Mat Martineau will provide advice to developers, ops
and distros how to make good use of the upstreamed MPTCP.

Mat will discuss kernel considerations, report on upstream merge
progress to date, and introduce the Multipath TCP Daemon(mptcpd) to
the Linux networking community.
