There has been an ongoing effort in the community to get Zero-copy working over
the last few years - with much success. While both MSG_ZEROCOPY (zero copy transmit) and
socket mmap (zero copy receive) have been out in the wild for sometime now, there are
no known high scale application consumers of these interfaces that are open source.

In this talk, Or Gerlitz will describe how he makes use of these interfaces to integrate
into spdk(https://spdk.io/) - an open source storage framework which uses sockets for nvme-over-tcp
in a smart NIC environment. The goal is to use kernel uAPIs while achieving high scale performance.

Or will delve into MSG_ZEROCPOY and challenges involved that he had to deal with. He will describe
the need for an app author to understand and how to tie-in their app state machine to the interfaces:
to address both transactions responses from the peer app and zero-copy notifications from the local socket
provider. Should the app use ZC with all or nothing approach or sometimes
yes and other-times no? Come to the talk to get the answer.

In addition Or will spend time going into the performance analysis details correlating
I/O performance visavis CPU cost (which is often tricky to get right with traditional tools like
profiler/flame-graphs).
