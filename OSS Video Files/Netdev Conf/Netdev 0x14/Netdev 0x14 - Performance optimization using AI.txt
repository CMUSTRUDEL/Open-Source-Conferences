In this moonshot talk Marta Plantykow, Piotr Raczynski,
Maciej Machnikowski and Pawel Szymanski will discuss an approach
to optimize networking performance alongside CPU utilization
with ML.
Marta et al propose an approach which will use ML to study RSS
patterns and the CPU spread and then react dynamically to
modify RSS hash parameters to improve CPU spread.

The authors will go over the challenges they overcame, show some
performance numbers and solicit feedback.
