Markuze Alex will talk about how they improved
by orders of magnitude client download times of a
global overlay network across public clouds.
The overlay network known as the Pathway project
(operated by VMware Research) interconnects
geographical spread of public clouds and their vast
compute and networking infrastructure

The secret sauce? KTCP, a Kernel module running on a
modified Linux Kernel which implements novel TCP
splicing.

Markuze and co. will discuss why their approach is
different relative to the many approaches already
out in the wild that implement TCP proxying. 
They will present numbers against classical approaches
which will demonstrate that KTCP is able to considerably
increase the link utilization by TCP connections and
reduce the connection latency close to its theoretical
minimum.
