eBPF is great but unfortunately tends to gravitate to the appliance
model; IOW, lumping data and control in one-off pile which solves
a simple problem.
Writing complex network services with eBPF is therefore painful.

In this moonshot talk, Fulvio Risso introduces
the Polycube project that eases ability to write complex
network services with eBPF.
Polycube network services have an architecture that moves
away from the appliance model by separating data from control
and management plane. With its model-driven architecture,
Polycube exposes REST APIs for service management.

This talk will go into some detail of the Polycube APIs
and abstractions and then illustrate the power of Polycube
with a small live demo.
