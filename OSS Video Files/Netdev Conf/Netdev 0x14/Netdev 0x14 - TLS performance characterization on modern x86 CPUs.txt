To offload TLS to the NIC or just get yourself a more modern
X86 CPU which ash AESNI instructions?
In this talk, Pawel Szymanski and Manasi Deval are leaning towards
letting the CPU do it.
They run experiments that compare user mode TLS, Kernel TLS write and
kernel TLS Sendfile to contrast various bottlenecks in each one with
regards to encryption and authentication, cost of system calls and the
memory bandwidth. They will present their results. The talk will provide
some insight on which of the three approaches is best suited for
different type of application scenarios
