Networks are getting faster but so is storage. It is not uncommon anymore
for a high performance storage device to deliver as much as a million
read/write operations per second. For traditional remote storage accesses
CPU requirements have become unsustainable. The recently merged NVMe-over-TCP
has improved performance lowering CPU utilization. However, despite of its
advantages of being able to use commodity NICs, NVMe-over-TCP's
performance is still significantly worse than NVMe-over-RDMA.

Rachit Agarwal describes some new ideas on how to significantly
improve the status quo. He will discuss a design, implementation
and evaluation of several new ideas within
NVMe-over-TCP. Their design maintains all the desirable
properties of NVMe-over-TCP (unmodified applications,
unmodified TCP/IP stack, etc.), and yet, saturates a
100Gbps link for remote accesses using CPU utilization
similar to state-of-the-art user-space and RDMA-based
solutions.
