MRP(Media Redundancy Protocol) is an open standard for ring topologies
in industrial ethernet networks defined in common standards-based
protocol(IEC 62439-2). In an MRP-enabled network each Ethernet switch
is connected to two other switches forming a ring. An MRP-enabled ring
can overcome single link point of failures at worst case recovery time
of 30ms - which is faster than STP.

In this talk Horatiu Vultur will describe the MRP protocol in
some detail. He will then proceed to discuss the effort to add support
to the kernel; implementation approaches considered and path taken
after receiving feedback on the mailing list. And last but
not least future work including hardware offload of MRP
as well as preliminary results comparing hardware-offloaded MRP vs
non-offloaded version.
