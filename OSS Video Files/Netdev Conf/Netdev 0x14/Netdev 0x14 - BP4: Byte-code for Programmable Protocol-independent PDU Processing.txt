Tom Herbert likes moonshots and three-letter acronyms;
first it was XDP and now it is BP4.

In this talk, Tom will introduce BP4 - a Domain Specific Language
for programmable dataplanes based on unifying the best features of
eBPF and P4. The goal of BP4 is “write once, run anywhere, run well!”
BP4 is intended to run in _both software and hardware_ execution
environments.

Central to a BP4 program is a dynamically programmable parser that supports
a wide variety of protocols and permits support for new protocols to be added
on the fly. The BP4 parser semantics include native support for parsing
Variable Length Headers (VLH) that contains TLVs, flag-fields, or variable
length arrays. 

Tom will describe the first PoC for BP4 which leverages the eBPF infrastructure.
The PoC  implements a flow dissector as a BP4 program by essentially replicating
the functionality of the current Linux network flow_dissector with extra
functionality to handle TLV and flag-fields. The programmable flow dissector
will then be used as the basis for a dynamic tc-flower classification
(which will allow protocols to be programmed and dynamically added for
tc-flower processing).
