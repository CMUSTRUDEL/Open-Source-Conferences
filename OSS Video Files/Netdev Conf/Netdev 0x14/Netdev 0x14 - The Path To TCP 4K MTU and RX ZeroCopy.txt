If you are a big shop like Google you are always looking to squeeze
all the juice performance you get out of your CPUs. Given the large
number of machines deployed, a 1% performance improvement could mean
millions of $$ in savings in both capital and operational costs.

In this talk, monsieur Eric Dumazet - the man sometimes refered to in
passing as some form of ninja - will describe changes introduced by
Google that help double TCP receiver efficiency in their datacentres.

Eric will discuss various issues that had to be overcome and a
variety of tuning that was needed to achieve these performance
improvements.
