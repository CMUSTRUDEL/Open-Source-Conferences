we can release them okay good so

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:52,230
probably at some point of the next week

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:57,090
we can we are able to make it so this is

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,250
at the end yes yes also a paper

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,390
regarding paper the line I mean those

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,820
that that those that were submitting

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,409
talks day and one of the things that

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,310
since the beginning we consider

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:15,020
important is that we we want to use the

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:20,100
conference's as a way to document

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:22,830
ongoing efforts and so all talks that

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,869
has been submitted the people that

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,400
participate on in on talks they should

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:32,310
send us a paper it's the minimum length

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,460
is two pitches and there are a couple of

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,880
templates on the website okay so they

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,759
should send them to us before then much

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,280
ok it's one month ahead more less so and

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,280
and regarding videos are also people

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,060
asking for videos because because we

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,729
have that many that many talks that many

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,590
baths too so obvious and so on so we

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,680
have an outstanding number of

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,540
submissions and we want them to feed

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,180
them to get them feed them to fill them

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,740
all into the conference they were

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,539
we were very excited about all the

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,920
topics that has been discussed so the

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,100
thing is that we couldn't attend all the

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,980
tracks at the same time right so we

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,850
should be able to to upload the video

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,550
soon on our YouTube channel okay and and

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,790
i would like to remind you that we have

00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:29,459
meeting at six thirty in the hotel for

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,570
the closing event is yeah we use the

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,700
word gala and but we probably didn't use

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,489
the right translation okay so you don't

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,640

00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:43,290
