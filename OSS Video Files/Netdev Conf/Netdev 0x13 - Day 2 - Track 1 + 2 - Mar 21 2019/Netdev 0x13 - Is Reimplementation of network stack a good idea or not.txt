Title: Netdev 0x13 - Is Reimplementation of network stack a good idea or not
Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2 - Track 1 + 2 - Mar 21 2019
Description: 
	Hajime Tazaki is a man on a mission.
We have seen him before talking about the Linux Kernel Library (LKL) whose intention was to take the whole of the linux kernel network stack and make it available in user space. He has since been staring at other possible candidates for user space network stacks.

Hajime tries to come up with some metrics on how to measure "maturity" of network stack
implementations: Using network protocol conformance tests of various IETF standards (RFCs) across multiple userspace network stack implementations.

In this talk, he shares the preliminary results, findings of buggy implementations, and possible testing framework that is going to be used going forward
