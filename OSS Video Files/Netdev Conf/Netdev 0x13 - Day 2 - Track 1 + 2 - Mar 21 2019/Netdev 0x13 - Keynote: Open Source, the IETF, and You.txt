Description: 
	Alissa Cooper, Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) chair and keynote speaker at
Netdev conf 0x13, talks about the relationship between Open Source and the IETF.

Once you have a decent open source implementation, should you really care about standardization? Are open source and open standards mutually exclusive?
She believes that they are mutually supportive and that the Linux developer community
and the IETF community should work more closely together.
