Description: 
	Or Gerlitz talks about support to handle virtio with SRIOV live-migration.

As of kernel 4.18 the virtio guest driver uses the SRIOV VF channel when it can or otherwise falls back to the classical the para-virtual channel. With this setup live-migration of VMs running under SRIOV is possible.
Or Gerlitz and Parav Pandit  propose a design based on the switchdev mode for
NIC host drivers.
