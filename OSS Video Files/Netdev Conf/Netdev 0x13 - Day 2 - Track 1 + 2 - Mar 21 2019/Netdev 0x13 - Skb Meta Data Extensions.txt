Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 2 - Track 1 + 2 - Mar 21 2019
Description: 
	Florian Westphal goes into the deep guts of the skb meta data extensions feature he added.

Dynamic skb metadata extension is a refreshing new feature added upstream recently (see commit df5042f4c5b9). A net subsystem can associate metadatum to an skb through its life span without affecting the size of the sk_buff structure.
