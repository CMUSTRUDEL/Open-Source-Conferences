committee so many where are you so many

00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:30,890
was our chair this is a lot of work and

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,840
the rest of our program committee

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,560
Alexander Rupa yona yona

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:41,030
Neela Boris Stephan Michael or Sabrina

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,340
Peter Florian and Jolly Roger a Andy and

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,310
Donald if you are a program committee

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,569
member please stand up

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,569
[Applause]

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:59,150
so for those of you unfamiliar with the

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,470
process we are kind of like a review

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,629
type of conference and we try to do it

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,730
in the blind and I think it's working

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:08,190
pretty well we have a lot of objectivity

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,040
so our program committee members they

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,650
get kind of reviews so if you submit an

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,349
abstract these are the people reviewing

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,819
it and sometimes you'll get e-mails back

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,590
saying we need more information and

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,269
things like that that's proof positive

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,360
that the program committee really is

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,890
doing their job they look through early

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,930
the content of this conference is that

00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:33,060
high quality because we have a very

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:35,129
dedicated program committee okay thanks

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,560

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,680
interesting proposals we know that it's

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,560
a lot of effort to submit the papers do

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,940
the preparation Oh make sure you submit

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,110

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:44,039
[Applause]

very cool that is a lot of people okay

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:50,099
thank you our tour attendees I would not

00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:53,159
make you all stand up but if you do you

00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:56,459
give yourself a standing ovations so

00:04:53,159 --> 00:05:00,299
some interesting statistics we had 240

00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:04,619
attendees 35 countries let's see a lot

00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:06,269
of Europe some South America there Korea

00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:09,089
okay that's good

00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,249
so yeah so we're getting a good mess

00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:13,799
don't there's a correction somebody

00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:18,659
tricked us you've listed Deutschland in

00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:20,360
Germany it's the same country well

00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,059
that's this is based on the registration

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,279
whoever visited their country actually

00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:33,749
dead that just split their statistic

00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:36,539
right okay so more thanks to our

00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:39,349
attendees we increased attendance by 30%

00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,639
over Montreal yay

00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,379
apparently the same local attendance of

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,179
local meaning people coming here so we

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:49,949
had 70 percent I guess from out of town

00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:51,689
and to remote speakers this time and

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:57,300
more importantly the t-shirt

00:05:51,689 --> 00:06:01,439
distribution so this is a good way to

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,779
track the overall productiveness of this

00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,360
group Tom I think nobody looking for the

00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:07,949
end of the community so we see the

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,629
larger t-shirts coming we know what's

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:14,519
happening the way we're doing this twice

00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,729
Oh

00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:21,119
last year and extra large group so we

00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:25,009
had a lot of mediums last year and fewer

00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:25,009
this year okay so we did we got larger

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,250
all right so people sitting in front of

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,570
their computer instead of exercising

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:36,570
that's a good sign you want to take it

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,320
okay as you know the native societies a

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,780
nonprofit none of us none of these

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,450
volunteers make any money we don't get

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,660
paid to fly here nobody pays for hotels

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:58,000
or our food it's it's pure voluntary

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,550
work and we try to be as transparent as

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,930
we can but being volunteers sometimes we

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,270
are a bit slow in updating this so we'd

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,470
like to what we try to do is before

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,360
every conference or after every

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,890
conference we publish our financials and

00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,710
we have audited accounting so if anybody

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,900
wants to come in and talk to us to see

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,810
the full audit of all our financials

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,930
please reach out to us but once in a

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,670
while we pop up twice a year or we

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,290
publish for each conference what the

00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,550
previous conference was because at this

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:35,470
point we're still gathering the stats

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:40,960
can you put up number two please so we

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:46,950
have some brief financial statement zero

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,950
two document

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,700
no that's not a financial statement

00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:05,470
Jamal maybe you can just provide the

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:09,610
summary why without the suspect all

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:12,220
right so this just is a breakdown from

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,810
Montreal but we had thirty six thousand

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,970
five hundred it's all in Canadian

00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:22,830
dollars in the bank and how much we got

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,850
$47,000 in 457 in sponsorships

00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,520
registration thirty five thousand eight

00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:31,330
hundred there's a fee we have to pay

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,140
because we don't run our own website for

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:41,410
registering for fifty nine and then

00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:43,600
those sales taxes so how in the end we

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:48,250
sort of broke even based on how much

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,620
revenue we got like but we had two or

00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,090
three people that we we pay for

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,880
batteries for people who can't afford it

00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:57,510
but really have to show up so that's

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,010
around six thousand dollars if you

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,350
ignore the thirty six thousand dollars

00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,760
we essentially were short five thousand

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,790
which was taken out of the thirty six

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,580
thousand five hundred twenty nine so we

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,120
still had some money in the bank which

00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,870
we used to initial the set up here in

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,810
Prague we are going to publish for the

00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:23,830
two conferences after we will make an

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:31,360
official release of financials after

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:32,770
this conference is calculated that's it

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,200
if you can put it back to slide number

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,030
one number one please so if sorry if

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,470
there's any questions on this if you

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,630
have questions now or you can come and

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,890
reach out to any of the board members

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,280
afterwards or send us an email or

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:51,970
however you want to reach us we will

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:53,110
provide you full detailed so I'm

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:56,200
sure most of you people are wondering

00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,450
what the hell is this so the the point

00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,190
of doing this is

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,290
the two things that you should all walk

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,600
away with right one is this is a very

00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,460
cheap conference as Ryan scheme of

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,050
conferences if you if any of you are

00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,390
involved with any of your corporate

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:11,520
sponsorship programs you will see that

00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,230
most like if you go to a VM world or

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,360
idea for something your platinum

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,310
sponsorship starts at a hundred thousand

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,710
dollars or something around this does

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:22,590
that mark the whole conference would be

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:25,380
covered by one sponsorship the second is

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,690
that this is really your conference I

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,410
mean in fact specifically the amount of

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,210
time and effort

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,950
Jamal puts into this conference in

00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,160
itself is staggering yeah but it's not

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:38,160
for profit it's for making sure this

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,660
community thrives right so so when when

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,370
it comes around right when the next

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,460
conference comes around please take that

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,470
extra 5% effort and make sure that the

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,750
conference is a success because its

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,240
value and its survival is going to be

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,350
dependent dependent on you guys more

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,020
than on anybody else or anything else

00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,450
thank you thanks to you yeah so it's the

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:05,280
conference I'd like to go to so I hope

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:14,100
you feel the same way there's an open

00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:17,250
question to that next so I put it on the

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:29,250
slide this is like can you bring up the

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:31,700
slides again that's zero one please I

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,700
think

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,110
should you do this yes when we do an

00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:49,330
open mic first and then okay what wide

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:53,020
feedback time we'll do feedback for

00:11:49,330 --> 00:12:06,130
about 15 minutes or so and then anybody

00:11:53,020 --> 00:12:09,760
wants to make a quick request I know

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,660
that's also not easy but can you put the

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,160
slides online before the presentation

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,690
we're trying okay

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,310
speakers can you submit your slides

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:34,570
before your presentation somebody has to

00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:36,160
drag them to do this yeah sorry it's

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,420
still against that part is still

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,490
volunteer-driven but I think I think

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,730
this is a very good request because

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,970
we've I mean a chance to give a little

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,250
bit of accolades the audio video this

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:58,839
conference has been amazing we've not

00:12:51,250 --> 00:13:00,790
always had that and for people who've

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,620
been to every one of the net devs before

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,520
we know it's a bit of a hit and miss and

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,930
I think this is a requirement for

00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,970
presentations from here on out we should

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,430
try to say one week before the slides

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:18,700
are in or we are not going to be able to

00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:20,800
put you on the list because no but

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,240
everybody works for a last minute right

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,430
all I'm saying is make an artificial

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,360
right okay how many people did this

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,920
flight back on the plane the day before

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,110
that's fine the day before the

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,120
conference starts but I think if the

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,640
audiovisual audio video is not good

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,550
it'll be so much better if people can

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:42,040
follow along I squint at the screen it

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,400
makes people pay attention if they don't

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:48,770
see the slides right

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:50,810
oh there's a bonus Oh Jamal Chang people

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:59,960
will say other slides I got the

00:13:50,810 --> 00:14:02,360
countless I'll just offer you can you

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:11,270
can see that I'm not sure how you're

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:22,790
gonna enforce it and people will work on

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:25,040
slides okay we're going to try right

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,080
we're working on synchronizing a website

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,060
with our storage system

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,070
so far we've a synchronized storage

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,370
system if you submit your slide at any

00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,420
time avy immediately gets it synched

00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,279
that's the that's what we've done for

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,870
this conference for the next one we'll

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,200
make that same system probably sync up

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,420
with a website right so and we'll just

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,130
enable it just on the day or the day

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,050
before so that it shows up on the

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:53,510
website as well that's something we can

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:55,220
work on sorry okay so since we were

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,279
talking about statistics and

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,570
representation I wanted to add what I've

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:04,610
observed in the last two three years

00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:06,970
with the conference and all the effort

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:10,010
put in by the board members and Jamal

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,470
the women representation has gone higher

00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,350
in the conference which is a really good

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:19,180
thing to say because it represents the

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,620
Linux community better and it also gives

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:26,860
courage to all other women to come join

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,860
and present so thank you thanks

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,250
so that we are trying to put an effort

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:47,390
in that direction we without claiming

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:49,730
we're doing so I wanted to see the

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,590
question then like what was the what I

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,710
want some feedback on the submissions

00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,450
process on the I mean this is I want to

00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,880
maybe even see that question with a

00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,230
statement the submission process is

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,440
difficult right I mean this is a very

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,440
wide area it's difficult to get that all

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,810
volunteer force dates times programs

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,840
software behind it blah blah all of

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:14,720
those things sorted out so bear with us

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,730
a little bit but also be a little bit

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,590
honest and providing as feedback it

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,600
doesn't have to be right now it can be

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,090
via email it can be through any other

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,920
means that you have used before but it

00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,140
would be very useful to get some ideas

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,980
on the table on what is working well

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:33,410
what is absolutely painful and how we

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,090
can do the paper like as a standard them

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,970
if the point is to make the paper

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,560
quality high what can we do to keep it

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,200
higher or make it even better than what

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,350
it is today and specifically the things

00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,910
that I think we need to worry about is

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,590
is how's the process working are you

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,260
getting feedback and and provide your

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,300
your input both as a author if you can

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,950
and also has an audience member what

00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,840
would you like to see better what would

00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,760
you like to have understood better are

00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,280
there questions are there topics are

00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,260
there specific areas that we should try

00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,990
to invite a few more speakers around

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,300
we've internally wrestled with trying to

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,400
get more tracks on onboard if there are

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,380
things that you guys would like to see

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,870
things organized around it would be very

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,580
useful to get some feedback but but do

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,790
participate right like I think the worst

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:24,110
response here would be no response

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:25,760
single track multiple tracks so we had

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,010
to have an experiment this time the

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,850
industry panel I think that we wanted

00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:34,490
for to get experience or get feedback

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:37,430
from from the group on that and in

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,110
particularly if it's positive I think we

00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,880
can start looking at what other types of

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,570
industries to bring in so there are

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,759
opportunities and we do have

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,799
some flexibility and sort of these

00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,840
future experiments but it's always good

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:54,129
if this is kind of user driven to get

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,369
that feedback comments comments in that

00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:59,350
front any people like the industry panel

00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,239
for example in fact I want to add a

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,769
sentence remember it's your conference

00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:04,450
so you get to decide what what

00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,639
conference would you want to go to so

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,789
tell us what you would want to see next

00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:12,220
that's a struggle for us sometimes we we

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,970
know what I know what I like because

00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:17,379
you'll go to this conference and

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:22,629
industry panel any how many people were

00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:24,820
were thought it was a good idea okay

00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:26,379
that's about probably 50%

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:32,019
can you see again how many people have

00:18:26,379 --> 00:18:36,399
no opinion how many people just decided

00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:42,190
to break during the industry - how many

00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:43,720
did how many didn't like it there's no

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,659
shame in saying you didn't like it

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,249
okay yes I mean say think of it again

00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:50,409
like I said think of it as you have two

00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:53,320
days right cuz you know it's not it's

00:18:50,409 --> 00:19:00,129
not exactly Colonel hacking but there's

00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:08,999
a correlation right hackathons doing

00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:08,999
hackathons right do you

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:26,160
you should probably say Nick next time a

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:31,370
hackathon a day to before or after half

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,370
a day how many people are up for that

00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:42,540
boat half a day won't work for

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:43,950
participants here's an operative it's in

00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,690
going through this conference how many

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,490
people feel like they now have some new

00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:56,450
work or some new ideas they're gonna go

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:57,810
back and work on Wow lightning talks

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,260
yeah

00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:04,800
Tom I know you're not very fond of them

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:08,280
what do you think so how many of you are

00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:12,480
familiar with lightning talks okay so

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:16,590
how many like them in general how many

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,840
do not like them that's I think that's

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,550
what you're gonna get so I don't know I

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,330
have mixed feelings about them and

00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:26,700
they're so fast and rushed and it's also

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,710
a question do you feel like you didn't

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,050
get enough content in three days eight

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:36,060
hours a day so just a quick note on the

00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,160
on the on the hackathon I don't think it

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,140
gained much I don't think you can manage

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,030
a hackathon half a day because it's

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,790
about the amount of time you have to say

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,960
hi and get a coffee and if you're

00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,700
actually starting to code anything

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:51,510
serious at all you need at least a whole

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,180
day it doesn't work that's my opinion of

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:57,720
course yeah so that takes us to four

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:59,430
days then yes actually that's I think

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,010
that's a question in itself right

00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,450
remember my question what would if you

00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,830
were driving this conference how would

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,100
you drive it would you give eight more

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,260
days

00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,090
or would you give it more content or

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,370
would you think or would you say the

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:14,400
size and the content is for almost

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,390
correct and let's just change the

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,390
components a little bit

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,180
to make another suggestion maybe just

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,790
actually allocating some time for people

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,040
to sit down and maybe not write code but

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:31,400
just look at code and go through things

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,320
together that is between the the

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,630
conference blocks so preferably not

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,040
after the day ends because that's when

00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,950
everyone goes to dinner and everything

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,210
but some some kind of slot in there yeah

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,220
thing in something like breakout

00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,200
sessions where like the quick guys can

00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,970
get together and the TCP guys can get

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,110
together so okay so a room in a

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:53,420
whiteboard so so I have one quick thing

00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,730
I want to follow up with that with a

00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,450
show of hands right so the choices today

00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,090
are more parallel tracks and a little

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,860
more breathing room or as much single

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:08,020
track as possible I don't know if you

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:10,220
know this but Jamal had like a long

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,460
hairstyle before he started doing the

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,710
scheduling then he kept pulling out

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,000
every every five minutes and we ended up

00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,220
with the schedule that we have today and

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,960
he spent two weeks on it so this isn't

00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,260
easy right I mean this is these are all

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,420
hard choices so if it's two days it's

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,910
going to be a dance program either you

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,400
go multiple multitrack not just two and

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,840
you'll get more time or you have to do

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,840
something else there was a common term

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:43,340
because I think the magic trick wasn't

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,740
that great it wasn't that great because

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,090
the mighty trick choice like I enjoyed

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,370
it more to have everybody in one room

00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,920
and being able to follow all the

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,420
presentations but it also it's it

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,520
depends on the schedule right like if

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,650
you if you can't actually if you have

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,060
topics that you can separate out more

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,620
nicely and you actually have different

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:08,540
groups and different rooms and it might

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:10,010
work better but it's hard okay so so one

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,230
comment about the whole hacker bounding

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,270
edge is just an anecdote so the IP said

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,010
guys we were talking earlier this week

00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,840
and suddenly we had this this brilliant

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,430
idea yesterday and then since then we've

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,010
been like hacking and we've been doing

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,420
it off to the side you know we go off in

00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,100
the breaks and do things and then we're

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,490
going to go to the ietf act on tomorrow

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,260
and stuff so is that a helpful like you

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,760
know not everyone listens to every talk

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,530
any

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,630
and you know you can always go off to

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,210
the side and have separate rooms set up

00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,210
for these sort of things where you can

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:42,010
have things is that helpful

00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,630
iíve been to many IITs and I've never

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,330
found a hackathon particularly useful

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:50,890
people find a way when they want to find

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:53,700
a way to do this sort of thing I think

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,559
that the first day here was really good

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,960
which has multiple sessions but you have

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:02,380
to compromise and like I wasn't

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,840
participating just for in workshop and

00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,570
hand-sewn on xdp it was really really

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,610
nice and I think it has to be motivated

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:11,530
someone has to prepare it because you

00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,000
have short time and I don't think how

00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,760
you can do hackathon in such a short

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,620
time so it's good to have the first day

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,320
with multiple sessions people can

00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:24,820
moderate either hands-on hands-on

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,160
workshop or a brainstorm or going in for

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,750
cert encoding the kernel on doing demo

00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,020
on we have some expert here for

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,610
performance on various fields that I

00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,410
think that that can be a really good

00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:38,230
that was a really good and I should

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:42,570
continue that and it has its I don't

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:45,070
think that hackathon would work so I

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,410
echo that that thought I don't think a

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,660
hackathon is particularly useful here at

00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,030
the same time one of the things somebody

00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:54,100
asked if if there's new work that I'm

00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,260
taking back from here and I definitely

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,540
am and a lot of that came out of side

00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,830
conversations that I had and I want to

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,780
have some more side conversations I

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,270
don't have the time to have them yet so

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:06,040
I think what so many says is right

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,450
there's there's a natural cadence to

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,950
these things and they're sometimes you

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,590
find that there are a couple of talks

00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,840
that you can skip and mutually and go

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,630
sit somewhere and chat about things but

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,419
if there was to be an additional

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:22,570
component I would say more extended

00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:25,210
break times might be useful but that's

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,500
that's that's a nice to have not not

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,030
necessary to have I certainly don't

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,970
think a hackathon this is particularly

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:35,410
useful so let me do one more survey how

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,030
many people think the sessions are more

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,970
productive and more useful than the

00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:42,150
hallway conversations so sessions are

00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:45,670
better than hallway conversations your

00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:48,010
that may be a half-raised okay okay now

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:52,060
be honest hallway conversations how many

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:55,360
people found those more useful okay I

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:57,250
think obviously we want both of them to

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,780
be productive and that's a lot of it I

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,100
think we need both I mean when you come

00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,930
here you have to have hallway

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,730
conversations that's probably a good

00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,290
reason to even show up here even if you

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:10,350
don't have 10 decisions that's what I do

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:14,680
I they I think that's a different story

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:16,300
so to my point was the hallways sessions

00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,090
are in the hallway maybe we just need a

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,090
way to have people grab rooms on the fly

00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:29,590
I think just half and half but but I

00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,780
think your survey question I want to add

00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,570
how many people here would say a three-d

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,100
would prefer a three-day program to a

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,140
two-day program or a four-day program

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,090
right I mean I was three this time so

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:42,250
right so if we were to add it by a day

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:45,040
how many people would prefer that and a

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,020
slightly more relaxed schedule versus

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,960
the current program and maybe some way

00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:57,100
to you know slow down time and make a 36

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:58,330
hour day so three day program so one of

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:03,810
the things I'll say okay

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:07,990
four-day program Oh three-day program

00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:11,430
two-day program it was either three or

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,240
four that one okay look the first day we

00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,520
you're not come to the workshops

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,440
anteater actually another question is

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,090
how many people like tutorials you know

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,870
there's a lot of new stuff we bring

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:24,010
people write the code or no all right so

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:26,500
we can have like a whole day of

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:31,300
tutorials so let me just break in for a

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:33,160
second right that's okay so I want to

00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,360
say something but that's okay um no I

00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,950
just want to go back to something you

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,690
we're talking about a few minutes ago so

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,610
I like the fact that we have mostly one

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,860
track and I like that for two reasons as

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,510
an attendee there's not the pressure of

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,580
a man which one am I gonna go to and

00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:48,190
then as a speaker it's like oh no who's

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,060
against me because that's a legit

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,560
feeling I know you don't want it you

00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,150
you know even though there's a lot of

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,760
effort made to schedule this stuff

00:27:53,150 --> 00:28:01,610
really carefully make a joke and either

00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,380
that's the person facing you right but I

00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,450
think it's I think it's I did like that

00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,820
we tried to do with this one yesterday

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,470
the morning tracks two of them I think

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,090
that was good but if we can I really

00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,590
like the fact and I'll echo the

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,260
sentiment that maybe a little bit larger

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,580
breaks for a lot of folks they've never

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,040
been to most of the cities were

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,450
traveling to so if we did have like half

00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,920
a day cuz usually I go on these trips

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,610
and people like hey how was it like the

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,170
hotel was awesome so if you know I don't

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,850
know want to built in tourist time but

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:31,190
do you wanna go as crazy as the Debian

00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:35,750
people they go up a mountain hiking from

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,040
whatever whatever just something to

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,520
think about so how many people agree

00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:45,190
with that one track is better than two

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,190
and two tracks is better than one

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:56,480
interesting one thing I heard from a lot

00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:59,030
of people is that and I felt this too I

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,860
think that a lot of us were and had to

00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,350
sacrifice um some some talks because

00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,890
there was too much conflict so I think

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:19,940
we need at least four days or something

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:21,830
spread things out to get back to the

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,270
idea of the hackathon parallel tracks

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,520
and stuff one of the things that can

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,320
happen and it happened people will get

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,150
together with an idea and they'll find a

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,250
place in the make time for it give them

00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:34,070
a place to go do that leave leave an

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,510
empty track room to go into that's just

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,190
there for people to sit down and get

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,980
together and do work actually we did

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,480
that you're gonna have times when people

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,830
don't want to go to one of the sessions

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,410
they're not interested in you know

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,000
they'll use that time more productive if

00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,740
they've got some of the pizza place to

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,710
go to will do a better job of making

00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,560
people aware that we actually had up to

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,600
a room up to 100 people 25 60 that were

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,160
just sitting empty that we use today we

00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,430
used one of them today for our for me

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,620
but but that that was accidental here no

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:07,020
no we even in Montreal we did this

00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:08,310
right I think you want a different setup

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,170
for those rooms and you want like

00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,400
whatever a small round table or

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:15,510
something that so people can actually

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:18,660
grab it and work together okay sure but

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,220
but I'll ask my ask my fiscal question

00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:22,230
then right like would that would people

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,940
be willing to pay more for that because

00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,470
all of these things are it's all

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,500
possible right all of these are not

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:30,480
impossible the question is we've always

00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,090
and I know Jamal has worked extra hard

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,670
at this trying to keep the cost down all

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,340
of these things will raise some pricing

00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,930
somewhere right if we were to go and say

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,460
and I think it's an excellent idea by

00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:44,040
the way personally would vote very

00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,660
heavily for a meeting room kind of set

00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,910
up and it has to be reasonable size

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,520
because you don't want people to have to

00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:53,670
wait to get in so if we were to bake

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:56,130
that in is there work ready where do

00:30:53,670 --> 00:31:00,120
people think ill asses elasticity is is

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,980
it in price how many people think the

00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,660
price of the conference is something

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:09,780
that we can go north on that's a very

00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:12,240
small sell so so the extra room begins

00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,760
to look very scared right now and might

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,100
get shot yeah we're trying I mean we

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,080
reduced costs elsewhere we've tried

00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,120
always to have an extra one or two rooms

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,560
that has been awful ah Sophie for some

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,270
time we're doing a poor job letting

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,970
people know about it because I think

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:28,560
Christy could just keep it could just

00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,480
keep at a table you go and sign up with

00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,630
her at the front and you can get your

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,630
room

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:47,620
yeah we could always just put down a mat

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:49,300
in the hotel lobby and said is what we

00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:53,560
would like to have bigger breaks so

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:55,860
people can and more days is that is that

00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,860
accurate

00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:04,360
yeah so workshops and to tour and more

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,650
tutorials right a lot more tutorials you

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,380
you like the tutorial

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,700
I missed the quick tutorial see this is

00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,800
the problem right I'm somewhere else I

00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,650
wanted to attain that but no so actually

00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,840
let me make sure I try I think we maybe

00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:20,980
I confused this story a little bit this

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:23,830
this time was three full days of of

00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,160
content one-day workshop and two days of

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,770
papers and we most of the people

00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,150
standing were sweating bullets at one

00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,390
point because we didn't know how to fit

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,770
everything in and and it was really

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,890
either reject papers that were

00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:41,680
interesting or do double track and all

00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:45,790
the the crazy gymnastics that we did

00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:49,540
with breaking this room so if we want

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:52,060
more was more singletrack same content

00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:56,050
and more breaks there's only one thing

00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:58,120
one other variable left so if that's

00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,770
what people are saying and let's be sure

00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,840
that that's what people are saying we

00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,540
want the one more day added to the

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,220
program so that we can keep maybe have a

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,260
little more relaxation and keep the

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,070
content more or less where it is is that

00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,070
what people are saying

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:29,510
like sure I mean it either way I just

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,280
said you should also consider adding

00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:40,220
half a day so people can fly out Friday

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:42,080
afternoon so would people prefer

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:46,160
tutorials to be totally separate day

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,510
maybe that's like yeah you come in one

00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,920
day earlier and that's for just for

00:33:47,510 --> 00:34:08,540
tutorials it could be two tracks of

00:33:48,920 --> 00:34:11,600
tutorials okay okay well that was in a

00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:15,080
tutorial but xdp was a tutorial for

00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,030
example yours was a tutorial there was

00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:23,740
some of them that were absolutely xactly

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:26,659
tutorials what you're talking about

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,100
no I'm just I'm just saying that I don't

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:30,620
I don't think you should change that I

00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,270
think it's fine to have freedom in how

00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,639
that works out okay so in listening the

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,860
people who come here if you if you ask

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,379
them if they wanna come for tutorials or

00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,480
not it seems to suggest or fall sick

00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:43,490
like it seems a looser false dichotomy

00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,280
that doesn't really exist because I

00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:48,379
didn't really see I saw the tutorials I

00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,330
ended up going to the tutorials and they

00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,649
seemed very much like talks to me the

00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,470
ones I went to I would have gone to the

00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:57,170
xdp one but I didn't yes so the xt-1 or

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,510
if you remember the one that paul and so

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,940
many did in montreal it was hands on

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:07,100
they gave you and these things required

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:08,660
like two or three hours okay so having

00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,590
said that maybe we should move to the

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:15,310
next point sorry

00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,310
somebody else

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:23,280
okay Oh another one day so what people

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,350
be okay with staying over on Saturday

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,810
usually these are co-located with IETF

00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:30,180
and usually it happens that the IAT of

00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,010
hackathon starts when this ends so would

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,650
it help if he moved like the tutorials

00:35:32,010 --> 00:36:00,660
and stuff to overlap with a hackathon

00:35:33,650 --> 00:36:02,070
nobody wants to say Saturday that's not

00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,300
a whole intersection maybe that's worth

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,300
exploring all right

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:14,900
I would like to the idea that some of

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:18,960
the tutorials were not really tutorials

00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:22,320
I have similar feelings from some of the

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,030
workshops on the first day that the ROS

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,640
kind of a problem because when you

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,730
allocate some 90 minutes for a workshop

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,340
when we want to talk about say five six

00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:35,790
topics that means 15 minutes which is

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,030
kind of only short and fast presentation

00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:40,890
of translate posing the ideas and not

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,900
much space for talking about them

00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,490
actually yeah yeah that's a good point I

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,490
thought that would be probably the only

00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,060
thing that I would say that didn't work

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,480
quite well

00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,220
I agreed I think I about every workshop

00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,830
was unhappy about the time allocated for

00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:00,570
them in the true Linux community sense

00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,280
right like there is some value and just

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,619
saying I gave you the idea you know my

00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,140
email address come find me offline right

00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,180
like everything else we will come figure

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,750
it out so I think I think the choice is

00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,980
not doing it versus doing it in a short

00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:17,640
way because again we don't have time

00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:19,650
right yeah one and a half hour I think

00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,970
may not have been sufficient for net

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:25,550
link hardware offload TC even TCP

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,840
analytics with three hours was probably

00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,580
was it okay there it was right

00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,890
borderline okay

00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:37,140
I should remind you all that we left at

00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:39,660
6:30 that day so some so to put things

00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,450
in perspective right we tried to do this

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,190
virtual machine thing in Montreal and we

00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,410
were learning so it didn't work out as

00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,880
well as the xtp workshop did so I think

00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,950
we are trying to improve the process and

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,540
make us more hands-on so so that the

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,700
workshops and tutorials feel more like

00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:56,430
workshops and tutorials and just be

00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,280
doctor yeah

00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:02,670
one more question maybe then we'll go to

00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,410
so one comment I'm sorry back to you was

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,000
a question with the a Cathay need if we

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:11,460
want to to extend the net they've even

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,900
with the ITF maybe the I Catherine could

00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,720
be the overlap between the two events

00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,950
that's what I said

00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:21,990
what what I want to what I mean is that

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:25,560
the the net dev Agathon is a joint event

00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:29,370
with the ITF academia they have really

00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:30,900
good food and it's free and I think I

00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:38,520
think they have alcohol which is also

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:43,470
free I think everything is free over

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,020
there no interest fee okay yeah anyway

00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:50,400
we'll have with okay we will keep it as

00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:52,860
an option so we need to move on I'll go

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,830
to the next the last topic of the day

00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,590
here so this is where we announced net

00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,920
dev the next native this our tradition

00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:06,120
at the closing ceremony we announced it

00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:08,060
but we have a small dilemma okay there

00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,590
are two choices that we're considering

00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,860
so our tradition so far has been every

00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:17,910
eight months we go to the next place and

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:21,120
we rotate continents so we were in North

00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:25,050
America we came to Europe next we go to

00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:28,440
Asia and we try to tie to the idea those

00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:30,930
are our simple rules the next in the

00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,000
eight months from now that's what that

00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:36,690
poor guy so that just was talking

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,440
earlier maybe can you put on the number

00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:42,270
three now please so we have a host

00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,109
that's we're more than willing to host

00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,579
us

00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:46,470
normally we find a host somebody had in

00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:52,200
our community or somebody was keen to

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:55,739
help and we have a host in who speak for

00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:59,009
himself there is written to you all from

00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:02,640
Bangkok Thailand and soon as excellent

00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:06,630
oh I teach at the Department of Computer

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,369
Engineering in possessives University we

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,739
are working with them that that society

00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:13,910
to select a person that meeting place

00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:16,319
for learning the Deaf conference

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:19,410
thankee - inviting me to join a

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,230
conference in fact unfortunately I'm

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:25,950
booked up therefore I had to show up on

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:28,529
the video to say hello to you all on

00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:31,529
behalf of Thailand Linux networking

00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:33,779
community I would like to find a

00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:35,519
committee to select Bangkok as the

00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:39,569
conference venue in this upcoming

00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:42,900
defender the Thai Linux networking

00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:45,809
community is still small parabot

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,970
serranos several of us gain a lot of

00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:51,089
benefits from the pants netic

00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,759
accomplishments the death in bangkok

00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:55,769
would be a consider level even at here

00:40:53,759 --> 00:41:00,509
driving more and more those networking

00:40:55,769 --> 00:41:03,450
activities in time as as you may know

00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:05,400
bank is the capital of Thailand with

00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:08,369
over 10 million people living in the

00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,700
city is talon lightest and most

00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:14,239
populated city the bangkok

00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:17,279
temperature are quite warm on year-round

00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:20,999
the climate in November is getting

00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:25,259
cooler November is very confident

00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:27,930
Ilia for the Pacific in Bangkok you can

00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:30,539
enjoy the visit schools and this is many

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:34,890
cultural places with warm hospitality of

00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:37,700
Thai people my very best wishes for

00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:40,999
successful in the Deaf in Prague I'm

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:44,849
really delighted to welcome you all

00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:46,049
forward to seeing you in Bangkok thank

00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:49,750
you Thanks

00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:52,030
so this is a

00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:55,060
now explain the dilemma we have that's

00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:58,000
eight months away some of the challenges

00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,560
we have is corporate people may not

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,140
travel probably to the same conference

00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,630
twice a year it's already its it within

00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,020
this year we had it in March and we had

00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:09,910
it we're now gonna have it in November

00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,500
sponsorship may be corporate some

00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:14,550
corporations wouldn't sponsor the same

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:17,620
conference twice a year so these are the

00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:20,770
challenges we have to deal with now this

00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,660
ties is the week before the ITF Thailand

00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:24,910
is a lot cheaper than Singapore where

00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:28,600
the idea of is being held so one-hour

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:30,430
flight or you can take a boat right you

00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,990
can come in a week earlier enjoy the

00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,510
beaches or stay a week later and enjoy

00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,880
the beaches I had I've never been there

00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:41,460
ever had fantastic beaches around the

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:45,390
place the other alternative we have

00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:48,190
which were contemplating as the board is

00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:50,080
we don't do this in eight months we do

00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:53,710
it in a year so that we can overcome

00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:55,630
these obstacles and do it unfortunately

00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,270
that will be Vancouver that would be the

00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:00,460
it way back in North America when our

00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,960
choice was supposed to be Asia so we'd

00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:06,940
like some feedback from from the

00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:09,460
community and all I know is that

00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:19,660
somebody said grew when Bangkok came up

00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:21,510
but no reaction to Vancouver okay so

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,100
please give us some feedback as to

00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:26,050
weighing out these options would you

00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,300
come to Bangkok in November

00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:32,590
how many would will consider show of

00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:39,640
hands eight months how many of you will

00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:41,410
come with sponsors so Bangkok again

00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,070
let's see shall fans November it's

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:49,330
November okay

00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:52,780
Vancouver in a year in a year to be much

00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:54,610
much about exactly one also we are

00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:56,290
losing three-quarters of our population

00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:57,809
because then they're not going to either

00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:01,329
okay

00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:05,049
let's try this again bang cockin

00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:07,569
in November you have to be in one of the

00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:18,160
two camps or both or what can beep in

00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:19,809
both or went over in March much in

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,710
fairness this is a year and eight months

00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:34,960
out Oh somebody likes much but not

00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:37,240
Vancouver I'm sorry this is still in the

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,799
distance so obviously people don't have

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,589
their calendar up trying to figure it

00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:44,440
out so maybe maybe we should ask what is

00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:46,029
the possibility or how many people

00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,460
definitely wouldn't do it maybe that's

00:44:46,029 --> 00:44:50,829
the more operative question how many

00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,980
wouldn't come to Bangkok if it's in

00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:55,809
November if they had they well I mean

00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:58,029
consider your situation you if you have

00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,740
this corporate constraints you're not

00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:04,299
allowed to go to native again this year

00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:11,980
or it's too far or you just hate

00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:15,089
Thailand or you'd rather go to much

00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,089
nicer place like Hawaii

00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:21,750
okay does anyone want to comment on this

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:31,349
I think maybe some mine free comments

00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:31,859
would be good doing online pool for this

00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:36,510
later

00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:45,440
oh you want to do a vote okay nobody

00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:48,299
please no trolls allowed okay all right

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,030
actually you know for for the corporate

00:45:48,299 --> 00:45:54,150
guys the people but I I mean the people

00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:56,220
whose money that can sponsor is it

00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:01,440
unusual to sponsor the same conference

00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:04,290
twice in a year would we be would we

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,700
have zero sponsors or you know it's

00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,760
totally impossible for you to sponsor

00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:12,690
again this year and if you say yes now

00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,089
we'll record your names and ah okay so

00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:17,849
so jokes aside I think we'll do this

00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:19,559
online do think very seriously right

00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:22,349
because this is a pretty big choice the

00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:24,210
the thing that would be a problem would

00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:26,520
be if you said yeah sure why not and

00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,380
we've spent the effort and we put this

00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,839
together and like you know 50 people

00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,430
show up or 40 people show up because the

00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,319
other thing that we should notice this

00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:39,359
year was our highest attendance ever

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:41,430
right yes actually projecting up and the

00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,950
locals are important any when we do it

00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:45,869
in Prague a lot of people from around

00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:49,079
here show up right within two three

00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:50,339
hours because it's easy for them if and

00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,140
we don't wanna leave out any other

00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:54,150
people right there well they're all

00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,680
members of the same community there's a

00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:58,470
community in Asia this community in

00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,000
North America I know if I know you

00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,470
wanted to new neighborhood all the time

00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:11,940
but think about the other people so

00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:13,470
sorry oh just a comment that I would

00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,020
actually love for it to happen in Asia

00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:19,500
because as you said it's it's nice to

00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:22,049
move this around especially it's good I

00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,790
think at this time the same time I would

00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:26,369
I would personally like it to happen

00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,589
with the cadence of a year just because

00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:28,609
there's more stuff to talk

00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:30,079
there's more things that I would have

00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:31,969
trust you the amount of papers we

00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,259
received this time sure whether it

00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:38,140
stopped submitting in the last minute

00:47:33,259 --> 00:47:38,140
please yeah like that's gonna happen

00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:49,729
I wore a second the you know thing that

00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:53,660
Janice said it is very hard to get

00:47:49,729 --> 00:47:57,499
corporate sponsorship twice a year once

00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:59,779
is very reasonable and yes

00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:01,489
Asia is better choice so if you had the

00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:03,019
other mix you would have seen all the

00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:06,949
three quarters of people you were losing

00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:08,839
they would have raised their hands well

00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:13,549
so Bangkok in March then is already

00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:16,959
saying a job well that dead breaks is

00:48:13,549 --> 00:48:16,959
away from the ITF I

00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:25,369
I do have an out-of-the-box suggestion

00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:26,959
since I seem to do this a lot how about

00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,779
trying to schedule this back to back

00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:32,269
with a NATO to the 802 dot one I Triple

00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:34,429
E what what is that how about trying to

00:48:32,269 --> 00:48:43,999
schedule net death back-to-back with an

00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:45,380
I Triple E 802 Taiwan meeting how many

00:48:43,999 --> 00:48:49,959
people from here would go to the I

00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,959
Triple E meeting and one

00:48:50,619 --> 00:49:05,450
okay Dave you're on your own buddy there

00:48:55,069 --> 00:49:07,250
was one more meeting was after the ietf

00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:13,849
last time so it was just the one time or

00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:16,180
what they always know okay sorry I just

00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:19,760
wanted to say a short comment on that

00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:23,150
notion of the same conference twice in

00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:25,819
the same year for many companies perhaps

00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:28,280
most it's not about calendar year it's

00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:31,520
about fiscal year which is different in

00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,650
each company so I already ran into this

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,690
problem once when one of the

00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:39,579
conference's suppose in I think

00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,930
September and another was in April

00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:46,869
necessarily the same with calendar year

00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:49,400
was you physically end well the

00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:52,880
financial planning in companies is not

00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,640
in culinary years but for some period of

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,539
12 months began for some company starts

00:49:55,640 --> 00:50:01,369
in April right so yes understood but if

00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:07,279
you are doing an eight month cycle there

00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:10,279
will be a year when it'll be twice I

00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:12,380
already ran into this problem it was not

00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:14,180
the same it's not for lack of content

00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:16,460
I'm not concerned about content to be

00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,920
honest with you it's submissions there's

00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:22,309
plenty of submissions okay I'm pretty

00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:24,289
sure people it's the problem is the

00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:27,170
financial the economical aspect at this

00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:28,910
point the issue with the calendar here

00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:32,839
is not so much when it starts and when

00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:34,549
it ended in advance so that would mean

00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:36,230
if you want to make more than one

00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:37,910
conference a year you also need to

00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,369
announce the second one well in advance

00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:43,880
so that the location is known and the

00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:46,710
travel cost can be pre calculated not

00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:49,470
that we're not as organizers

00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:53,220
so in in the ITF we also had the problem

00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:54,630
that our income was tied to the ITF

00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,520
meeting right and then what we see right

00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,110
now is we offer remote participation so

00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,850
the number of attendees goes down our

00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:01,290
income goes down so what we're trying

00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:03,090
with our sponsoring water right now is

00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:05,250
awesome to not bind it to a meeting just

00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:06,840
you know ask for sponsoring for a year

00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:09,320
and then try to spend the money more

00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,320
flexibly

00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,230
we started six months we went to eight

00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:28,320
and now we're going to a year

00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:30,420
what's next two years like you say I

00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,980
want your money for the next year and I

00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,210
want this amount of money and then you

00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,710
use it for all conference you're

00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:38,450
planning in there so what you're saying

00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:42,480
from a funding model perspective we

00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:45,210
sponsor the amount is X per year right

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,660
and that we decide whether it's divided

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:54,570
by two or divided by 1 or divided by 3

00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:56,760
so it's already started doing that we

00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:58,560
try to because it doesn't scale because

00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,460
we have less income per meeting but more

00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:04,400
costs which are continuously running or

00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,840
wants to say something

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,150
panco stand the challenge that you need

00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,220
like more than once in years of those

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:13,290
challenge with sponsorship and with

00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,510
attendance but as you said that

00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:17,220
sponsorship fee he was much smaller than

00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:19,860
any other place and also the attendance

00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,290
we see people I'm Alex other companies

00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,540
going to article OpenStack conference

00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,920
where only their thousands of dollars

00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,920
and this is a very dynamic community

00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,190
we're really working so there is some

00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,380
advantage to meet somehow every eight

00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:37,670
months and not every 13 months or

00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:42,780
something so I think we should we should

00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:44,040
it feels to me like once a year it's it

00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,600
could be better if we do it every eight

00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,150
months nine months something like that

00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,050
but you can either do an organize Poland

00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,050
and see what's people

00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,480
have you condemned we got all the

00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:58,340
content just eight months excuse me we

00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,690
have a lot of content I mean more I

00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,040
think we have more content this time

00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,130
than last time and it's only been eight

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,480
months right so my concern is see so

00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,920
you're never getting the content and

00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,960
there's a lot of people with a lot of

00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,400
stuff so you got the content you got the

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,390
people long you got a Content you got

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,980
the people what's the problem instead of

00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,660
spreading the timeout between them go

00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:20,560
ahead and make him closer together if

00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:22,730
you're gonna grow grow have two a year

00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:24,890
corporate sponsorship shouldn't be a

00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:26,120
problem there's other conferences that

00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,360
do two to four a year

00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,580
in other open source oh the sound of

00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,560
Sonics selfish I like this I like the

00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,470
fact that I can talk to everybody a

00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,440
small conference as opposed to an open

00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:42,740
stack 30,000 people conference this is

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,180
great right you you communicate with

00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,030
other people have all the way

00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:49,250
conversations so but keep in mind we

00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:51,230
also see higher participation numbers at

00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:52,760
European meetings then at Asian meetings

00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,620
for example and you will probably see

00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,300
the same for the submissions because if

00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,950
people can't travel to the place they

00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:09,290
want to submit something right so higher

00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:13,970
than North America or about the same so

00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:15,800
I just saw the voice on you're trying to

00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,480
do this along with the idea for a reason

00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,920
right that it's convenient for people

00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,450
who are going to the idea to be able to

00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:26,930
go to this as well I'm sorry he started

00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:29,150
this oh well so so I think it's it's

00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,560
valuable to have that personally for me

00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,710
it's super valuable to have that but if

00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,480
we start doing it at a cadence that's

00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,210
that's super high like even if we do it

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:40,970
twice a year and the general case I

00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,250
might risk losing my family and that's a

00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:46,250
real concern yeah it's take if I have to

00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,290
go two weeks instead of one week two or

00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,150
three times a year that makes it harder

00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:53,180
but again these are just you know

00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:55,450
considerations I think ultimately you go

00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:57,550
where the polls go and

00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:01,330
do the poll see where people land and

00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:03,430
run with it okay I what the action item

00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:08,460
I heard was ITF you need to slow down

00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:08,460
make it once a year so that we can keep

00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:14,650
we'll do a poll I'll set up a Google

00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,620
Form and we'll do a we'll do a quick

00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:19,780
survey but did everybody understand the

00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,490
choices we are go we are faced with

00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:23,560
hopefully we will put some more words in

00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:25,990
the poll and it'll be clear and we have

00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,570
to make a decision quick right yeah I

00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:31,660
mean clearly how high is the winning

00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:44,740
choice here but but but actually behind

00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:47,350
my house is the best choice but alright

00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,740
thank you everybody hopefully we'll see

00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,740
