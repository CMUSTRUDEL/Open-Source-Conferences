Publication date: 2019-06-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 3
Description: 
	The Industry Perspective Panel is a new session which will bring
in networking industry craftsmen to discuss different topics.

The primary goal is to have developers (and ops types)
appreciate how Linux (networking) is used in the industry. We are
not going to restrict the perspectives to be Linux only i.e a
panelist does not necessarily have to use Linux in their operations,
but needs to answer as to why not.

The secondary goal of this session is to learn how we can
do better in Linux. Both users and non-users of Linux can
teach us something.

The format is:
- The panelist gives a presentation of their craft
- questions by panelist moderator(s)
- open mike to the conference

At 0x13, the theme was network operations. We have:
- a big data centre view (LinkedIn)
- a world wide cloud platform deployment view (CloudFlare)
- and an edge cloud view (Mobiledgex

Panel co-chairs: Sowmini Varadhan and Roopa Prabhu
Featuring panelists:
Artur Makutunowicz from LinkedIn,
Marek Majkowski from Cloudflare,
and Vikram Siwach from MobiledgeX.
