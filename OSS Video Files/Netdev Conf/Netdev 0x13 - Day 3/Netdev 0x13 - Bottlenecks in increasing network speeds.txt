Title: Netdev 0x13 - Bottlenecks in increasing network speeds
Publication date: 2019-06-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 3
Description: 
	In this talk, Tariq Toukan reviews the main bottlenecks that are being addressed to support NIC speeds of 100Gbps, 200Gbps, and beyond.
Over the last few years, NIC speeds have gone up from 1G to 10G to 25G to 40G and now 100G and 200G and even 400G NICS are going to be showing up in the commodity market soon.

Every time these rates go up, new challenges come to the surface in the kernel. 
Tariq summarize several ideas and solutions ranging from traditional tricks of the trade like page recycling to innovative HW capabilities that helped to recently achieve milestone packet rate of 100 Million PPS in XDP_TX and 135Mpps in XDP_DROP.
