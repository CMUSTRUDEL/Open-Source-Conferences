Title: Netdev 0x13 - Accelerating QUIC via Hardware Offloads Through a Socket Interface
Publication date: 2019-05-26
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 3
Description: 
	Joshua Hay discusses an interface to support hardware offloads used by QUIC such as cryptography and transmit segmentation.
In this talk he describes an effort with his co-authors for an implementation
and proposes APIs similar to KTLS. He also presents performance measurements and results using the chromium QUIC implementation.
