Title: Netdev 0x13 - Viscum:  A New Light Weight Architecture of Mobile Edge Computing
Publication date: 2019-05-26
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 3
Description: 
	In this talk, Jae Won Chung describes Viscum, a light weight approach to MEC.

Multi-access edge computing (MEC) was intended as a network architecture that offers cloud-computing capabilities within the RAN or core network in the cellular world to allow processing of tasks closer to the cellular customer. It has, however, evolved to be generic to apply to any network for deploying applications and services as well as to store and process content in close proximity to mobile users.

Current MEC approaches are too invasive. In this talk, Feng et al propose an alternative light weight mobile edge computing architecture which utilizes existing Linux kernel mechanisms, namely: Traffic Control (TC) utilities, and network Namespaces.
