Quick UDP Internet Connections, pronounced 'quick' is a new important transport which is growing at a phenomenal rate. Studies have shown by November 2017, QUIC
already represented 20% of the total mobile traffic[1] and grew over 200% in two years.
There are other advantages for QUIC; refer to 0x12 talk[2]. 

QUIC is implemented on top of UDP making it much easier to deploy improvements
and fixes when compared to TCP which is in the kernel (and therefore requires
kernel patch submissions and process overhead).
