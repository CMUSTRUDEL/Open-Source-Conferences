Publication date: 2019-05-03
Playlist: Netdev 0x13 - Day 1 - Track 2 - Mar 20 2019
Description: 
	Kostis Kaffes and Christos Kozyrakis argue that preemptive scheduling
is in fact _a good thing_ in the strive for microsecond-scale latencies for

have better control of latencies. 
In this talk Kostis and Christos describe their approach: Shinjuku
