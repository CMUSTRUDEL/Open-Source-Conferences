bottom there we just thought it was

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:42,440

outside but he kept it warm inside and

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,520
thanks to youth the attendees you came

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,760
here during the call this week of the

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,250
year during possibly a long weekend if

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:37,010
you're from the US or canada during a

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:45,410
weekend and on Valentine's Day thank you

00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:50,630
give an applause for a song speaking of

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:52,300
attendance we had 150 people from 17

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,590
countries spanning three continents

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,630
those countries are listed there we

00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,090
didn't want to list numbers for privacy

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,380
reasons but you can see the numbers you

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,050
can see the countries they listed in

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:12,830
order possibly I won't say this but

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:15,500
possibly of a number of attendees okay

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,840
it would not be complete if I didn't

00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:23,490
show the t-shirt sizes so I'm going to

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:26,310
show the t-shirt size there you go

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,169
so I don't know if the cut the audience

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,000
is getting slimmer or what but when you

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,069
have the media net latch that's a little

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,530
disappointing drink some more pop for

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:48,990
next for next native yes USA USA okay

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:51,380
you know that number okay oh sorry I can

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,380
see this

00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,910
so so we started this conference and we

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,550
want to be slightly different when we

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,810
initially started we said okay first of

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,030
all there is no marketing allowed in

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,400
here you can't give us your money and

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,789
use a session to market your product

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,629
that sort of that filtered a few vendors

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:20,690
that wanted to sponsor we wanted to make

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:22,759
it very easy to access so you know if we

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,650
if we could have succeeded this should

00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,419
have been a the free or like 25 bucks a

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,210
day of 50 I think we started shooting

00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,340
for fifty dollars then we looked at the

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,930
budget and okay maybe $75 and then

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,360
eventually settle for 100 we're probably

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:40,550
going to lose some money but it's not as

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,110
bad right so we did allow for one day

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,520
admission so you can show up for one day

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,840
and then you don't like the next day's

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,270
session you show up for the other day

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,169
the third day this is just so that we

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,789
make it accessible it's canadian dollars

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,560
that's one hundred dollars is the best

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,180
we could come up with and canadian oil

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,280
is really cheap for you guys coming from

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,400
outside where the majority of people who

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,539
attended so i hope you found it

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:08,810
accessible we tried our best not to

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:11,930
reject talks because we closed the

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,270
session three months earlier we wanted

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,270
to make it open so that if you submitted

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,090
a paper a month before it was before the

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,259
conference you could still make it

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,639
because most people don't find out about

00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,110
the conference they find out later and

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,880
then they get excited and we don't want

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:30,500
reject papers we've seen that happen in

00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:33,020
other conferences we do not want to

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,969
reject registrations I think we had five

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,159
people just walk in here yesterday and

00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,960
register the only thing is you can't use

00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,389
bitcoins or credit card or you have to

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,319
pay cash that because we're not set up

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:49,580
for anything else so some of the

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,469
challenges was because we were not see

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,490
this is netdev zero that one we didn't

00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,360
know how many people are going to show

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,770
up so most of our setup was trying and

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Steve goes very stressed by this how do

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,190
we find a location that will allow us

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,550
just like a leg or we can add another

00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,610
room right so it turns out that was a

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,969
very difficult thing to do

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:12,129
so but but as we kept going on we we

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:13,960
came to a realization that all right we

00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,569
think we can estimate the number not to

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,280
it given that with the schedule is

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,009
posted two weeks before the conference

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,479
we probably won't exceed 200 people so

00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,550
at that point we made a commitment with

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,710
the hotel that all right we're going to

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,810
stick with approximately 200 people

00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,829
capacity so that was a challenge it's a

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,149
lesson that we will do better next time

00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:35,169
you have to look very closely at the

00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,120
contracts if you want to run a

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,279
conference believe it or not we're

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,140
paying a tip for sitting in here

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,970
eighteen percent typically that's cut it

00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,620
for if you buy food and you eat here

00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,860
then you have to pay the people with the

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,890
serving of the food but it's now tied

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,899
into the contract and we missed it that

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:00,880
we're paying a tape for someone who's

00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:02,560
not serving us fully so lesson is we'll

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:09,459
look closer at the contracts in the next

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:11,470
time some challenges all right from we

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:14,470
want to do this too it's done took four

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,360
months over the year of end holidays

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,279
which is you know you get christmas new

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,110
year people go on vacations it's

00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:24,880
December everybody's just thinking about

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,320
vacation right probably inviting people

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,940
in the call this week of the year may

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,459
not have been appealing to some people I

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,660
think somebody told me well it's cold I

00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,640
need to see the schedule the schedule

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,230
came up two weeks later than they they

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,230
say when we can't come it's too late now

00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,209
we have look we're takers we don't have

00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:46,920
good marketing our marketing division

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:49,390
was Richard and he was posting on native

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,430
I'm sure we got to you but we didn't get

00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:55,720
to the copied a class of people we can

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,000
probably do better I'm not sure if we're

00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,380
better off by having people who think

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,220
like us or we could have diversity

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,620
around so any we're learning we're going

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,339
to do probably better marketing the I

00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,779
think the ultimate lesson is we know how

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,519
to run in a conference next time

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,320
everybody here is an amateur and we

00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,850
learnt how to learn one it'd be a lot

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,240
smoother if you ever decide to come back

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,240
to ro

00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:26,570
so the question is the I'd like to sort

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,860
of engage some questions here what what

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:33,440
do we want this was a boot stop right we

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,970
put it up net dev 01 it's going to

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,470
continue we're going to actually hi the

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,320
next sliders are going to hand over to

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,149
to Pablo for the next one but the

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,920
question is what do we want this

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:48,290
conference to be we've tried to set the

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,940
format what we like to hear if anybody

00:10:48,290 --> 00:11:09,860
has a comment on what we could do

00:10:49,940 --> 00:11:12,050
differently the county it was the

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,800
content right did people think this was

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:20,740
probably too low level maybe to Colonel

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:23,300
friendly not userspace friendly right

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,800
how many people thought the content was

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:30,980
just right Wow okay could we have used

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,540
more user space talks maybe write things

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,199
that use the networking subsystem but

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:42,069
they in user space I'm sensing like a

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:45,170
colonel bias here okay like for example

00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:46,699
Andre was talking about bird which is a

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,850
routing demon that's in userspace

00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:52,160
totally right what I mean is something

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,800
like that right maybe we could invite

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,920
some guy doing a cool dns server next

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,839
time still using our system so Andre has

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,209
some comments on how the counter could

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,769
be improved to help him right would that

00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:11,120
kind of talk be useful that for the next

00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:16,699
time show of hands okay was it too low

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,199
level to high level to low level okay I

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:20,560
think we got some kernel people in

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,560
heaven

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,900
what could we have done better we had

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,670
boss working workshops and talks if

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,980
you're presenting in the talk you and

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,630
tutorials I'm sorry could we have done

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:37,240
things differently I think I had some

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:39,670
comment foams so always all yeah my

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,090
first I think you didn't excellent jobs

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,770
to everybody so congratulations the only

00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,780
comment that I made was that given all

00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:49,240
the discussions people are having kind

00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,100
of standing around when you talk about

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,950
computer science you need a whiteboard

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,630
right in order to get quickly drawn I

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,970
would have actually put a few white

00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,560
boards around that we could have erased

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,380
and I think it would help people have

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,500
side conversations to have something

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,270
they can draw on and and stuff and you

00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,950
know you can get fancy ones that do wish

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,050
we were talking about that you know you

00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,480
can print from but just the

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,160
old-fashioned ones that you can write

00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,460
out of the race would probably be good

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:21,220
for most of us in terms of expediting

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,950
conversations even out in the hall where

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,210
a lot of gatherings occurred but I do

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:30,720
want to thank you I think y'all did an

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:33,280
excellent job thank you white boards ok

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,140
so one thing we had initially thought to

00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,570
it will have interactive remote people

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,460
connecting we just didn't want to pay

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,960
for the extra bandwidth that would have

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,610
been like a blue jean session or

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,460
something and somebody is going to be

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,100
participating on a big screen would that

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,770
be something useful you think you don't

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,050
have to shop the auto and cold probably

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,210
for a while but at least it is a warm

00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:00,070
place with you would you actually rather

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:03,300
do remote to show up job yeah they cross

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,300
pollinate pollination

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,900
mean so I think the idea I don't know

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,550
what proper term is but maybe

00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,290
cross-pollination that happens on the

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,440
hallways that's probably just as

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,480
important as the talks or who's gone

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,160
wanted to have little break so he could

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,750
go out and skate or something will that

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,750
be something useful for the next time

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:43,350
Mike okay yeah it just may be a

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,600
recommendation maybe if the presentation

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,700
would be published at the end of each

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,930
day so maybe I could review the material

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:54,120
maybe talk face to face with the

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,680
presentation oh that's an excellent idea

00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:03,740
I think we should probably publish them

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,740
before the talk but yeah right right

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,490
so I know I have a few in my laptop that

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,610
people had sent to me directly harout

00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,500
was trying to synchronize I think the

00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:22,320
videos and the end they slice do you

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:30,270
wanna speak to that uh yeah you can you

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:31,980
can have mine yeah so all the videos

00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:34,320
that got recorded especially for the

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,760
talks I'll be synchronizing the slides

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,730
with those assuming I get them from the

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,710
presenters so once I get the slides from

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,480
the presenters aside from being put in

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,130
the videos i guess i can coordinate that

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,530
Jamal with you or whoever is maintaining

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,750
the website myself or Brenda yeah we can

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,790
we can get PDFs of those published of

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,410
course they may need to be cleaned up

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,070
email addresses removed that sort of

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,290
thing okay so one thing is vertically if

00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,420
you wrote a paper please please for

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,390
heaven sakes submitted okay I have a

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:07,050
comment I found what's really useful in

00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,360
some conferences is the meals or parties

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,310
or events together it's kind of another

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,050
extension of the hallway talk when

00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:16,200
you're kind of sitting around a table

00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:18,270
together and talking in a casual way and

00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,640
what I found is we tended to click with

00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,960
the people we already knew and so some

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,060
of these things where you do everything

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,550
together rather than splintering off

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:30,450
with your comfort crowd gets more

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:34,590
collaborative conversation with people

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:38,370
you don't already know okay thanks did

00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:41,160
you own system to that topic I also want

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,020
to think about the other end of the

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,610
spectrum which is that some of us who

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,770
have been doing is for six or seven or

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,750
eight days some nights want to have a

00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,430
very small controlled group to just have

00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,380
a pleasant meal together not have this

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,360
gigantic group of 50 60 people that we

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,650
have to contend with every evening so it

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,790
has to be balanced if we're going to do

00:16:55,650 --> 00:17:01,520
something like that but I do agree that

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:03,680
is good value to it okay that's fine

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,440
Kathy I'm gonna hold you you're gonna

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,420
need some more money next time I was

00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:11,630
just going to say that let's not wait

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,100
for the video synchronization get the

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,530
slides posted okay the slides will be

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,910
posted we know as quickly as possible

00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,100
the volunteers are going to put some

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,470
effort into getting them in shape by the

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,720
next two days first case I think I

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,160
wonder in terms of the meals finding a

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,080
venue that's able to host that many

00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,170
people all in the same place is pretty

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,510
difficult and I certainly agree with the

00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,920
value of mixing things up so I'm not

00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,080
quite sure how you would socially

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,980
engineer it but it would be good way it

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,720
would be good to find some way of

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,030
finding a half a dozen venues and

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,730
getting a random sampling and people to

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,470
show up at each one we could use some

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,240
kind of other social factors to be able

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,630
to mix people instead of using the

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,610
technical groupings that already exist

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,250
how many people do we get yesterday for

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,500
the buff for the skating there is 25

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,540
people that showed up I guess most

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,940
people scared of the ice so that was I

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:10,490
know I have ingredients I had a great

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:13,690
time yeah thank you that does its own

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,690
social mixing right there

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:23,290
alright so I'm just going to hand it

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:29,470
over to Dave and then we will continue

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:31,300
with a little handover process just like

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,920
Jamal said I'd like to thank all the

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,810
volunteers and people who organized this

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,520
this is in my opinion a very successful

00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:39,520
conference a lot of people together

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,360
working on things and helped people at

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,010
the colonel end of the spectrum

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,630
understand what people idea and the

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,640
other spokes in the wheel one from us

00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,230
and need from us and vice versa so that

00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,970
was very useful and in particular I'd

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,310
like to thank Jamal to get the ball

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,710
rolling in the beginning it's kind of

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,660
funny how these netdev and netcom

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,610
conference has happened me and Jamal

00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,710
exchanged a friendly email about hockey

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,390
or whatever and be like maybe we should

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,190
do a conference yeah maybe we should

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,930
okay I'll look into it i'll get back to

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,600
you and next thing you know here we are

00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,890
it's almost like magic but i don't want

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,330
to take him for granted he did a lot of

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:13,570
hard work to make that actually happen

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,310
so I appreciate that so that's what has

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,780
happened over the past couple days and

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,610
we need to start looking towards the

00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,290
future that's the next conference and

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:31,780
for that purpose I'd like to hand in my

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:34,630
co / to Pablo okay I real estate brief

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:38,050
basically we don't have half except they

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:42,010
yet but it will be in South despain in

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:44,680
Seville and expected more or less end of

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,300
this year beginning next year so main

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,000
International Airport I'm Madrid and

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:52,750
Barcelona so and we wish you to see you

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,930
there and I'll try to make sure that

00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,310
what while organizing the next

00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:01,300
conference will take care of all the

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:04,900
things that you have proposal and we can

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,890
get that done so see you see you in in

Seville is all this way

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,789
okay and this is going to be a lot

00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:15,250
warmer so now we go from extreme call to

00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:19,440
extreme heat problem all right thank you

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,440
