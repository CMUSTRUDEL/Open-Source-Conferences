	Distributing TC Classifier Action
Jamal Hadi Salim and Damascene M. Joachimpillai
February 2015

Description from netdev01.org:
  This proposal will discuss distributing the Linux Traffic Control (tc) filter-action subsystem packet processing across disparate nodes. The nodes could be a mix and match of containers, VMs, bare metal machines or ASICs.

A new tc Inter-Forwarding Engine (IFE) action is introduced based on ForCES WG Inter-FE LFB work (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-forces-interfelfb/). The paper will go into both the implementation as well as the usage of the IFE tc action. Details on how to add new extensions to the IFE action will also be discussed.
