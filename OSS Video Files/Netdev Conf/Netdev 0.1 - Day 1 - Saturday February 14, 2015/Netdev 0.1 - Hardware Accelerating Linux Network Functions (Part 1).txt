	Hardware Accelerating Linux Network Functions (Part 1)
Toshiaki Makita
February 2015

Description from netdev01.org:
 Linux Kernel Switchdev API being discussed recently in the context of supporting networking switch ASIC's is the future of offload API's. And existing standard Linux interfaces can be used to offload Linux network functions to a network switch ASIC.

In this tutorial we will demonstrate this with an existing implementation.

We will show how existing Linux networking tools like iproute2/brctl/ethtool can be used to offload to a network switch ASIC.

We will start by talking and demonstrating various virtual switching technologies around the Linux bridge and related technologies (SRIOV, macvlan etc).

We will then proceed to demonstrate how Linux bridge can be accelerated with commodity network switch ASICs utilizing the same control tools:

    Create bridge device, add network switch ports using `ip link` or `brctl`
    Set vlans on bridge ports using `bridge vlan add`
    Vlans programmed in hardware
    hardware learning, software aging of fdb entries
    Dumping hardware fdb tables using `bridge fdb show`

We plan to cover L3 as well.

Most of the network switch drivers available today rely on a closed vendor SDK API. We will not be able to cover all hardware details, but we hope to show enough details of kernel structures offloaded to hardware for easier API development.

We will use an industry standard network switch running Debian based Cumulus Linux distribution. We are also looking at possibilities of showing this on other devices running Linux.

all right we gotta get started thanks

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,120
for coming

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,799
the self a cessation of the conference

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,080
this is about everything you ever needed

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:23,660
to know about switching bridging all the

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,640
way from NYX to SRO v2 virtualization

00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,580
and eventually we to hardware

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,750
acceleration our still speakers today

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,840
are toshiaki Makita rupa prabhu who's

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:50,899
sitting over there will some common

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:58,469
pleas today this is a children system

00:00:50,899 --> 00:01:03,870
hard as omega t and i take charge of

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:08,939
path one part of their leaders and after

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:12,270
I explain this slice through pioneer

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,640
song will introduce you Hardware

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,869
absolutely they show no bridges and

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,869
other fashions

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:31,140
this is part one topics I introduced

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,920
various special sensing technologies in

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:39,060
the next software cities and it can be a

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:45,390
cities and also I'll show you with an

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:48,690
Olivia commands for grades and thanks

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,750
I've introduced recent features of

00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:56,820
bridge at the UN techo bid on the drink

00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,280
in fact in control don't promise gas

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:06,020
bridge and we are meeting for it and

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:12,450
finally I'll show you a demo of

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:17,100
nonprofits experts and let me introduce

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:21,390
myself I am toshiaki monster from and

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,190
the open source of Jacinta I'm providing

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:30,600
technical support or entity group

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:34,220
conference cognitive system it's

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,220
cerebrese yeah

00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,930
so now I introduce switching

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,849
technologies idiots

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:47,510
legs kind of has three types also test

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:52,760
witches bridge man feelin and open

00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:57,049
disease and instead of those softer

00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:01,400
switches we can use equivalence which is

00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:04,819
arriving device and these are often

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:09,470
useful in dependence on modulation so

00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:15,680
I'll show you how these are used in Java

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:17,590
traditional around the past switches

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,639
bridge

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:27,650
this is a device like Haris each it has

00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:28,629
a baby for the baby and the spine 3 and

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:35,739
so on

00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:43,370
it uses promised a small to receive old

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:46,389
pockets because onyx filter you just

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,900
first destination is not these matters

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:53,870
if it is not promises and if you also

00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,370
filters multicast and in other markets

00:03:53,870 --> 00:04:00,609
but it was so we need from it a small

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,609
bridge pose

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:17,150
the video shows how the bridge was we

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:19,820
just breathe the physical device the

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:24,140
physical device passes the brain

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:29,600
receives brain to the polarity but with

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:35,660
bridge it passes the brain the bridge

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:40,220
had passed and the bridge was to another

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:43,300
average post and in this initial mother

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:48,400
sees the bridge devices

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:48,400
it was it - mm

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,860
who use breach in the body radiation

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:04,809
environment with top device device

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:13,389
converts into binary in variety of

00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:17,219
intersection so capable are the most

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:21,629
honest trade can use party scripture to

00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:21,629
send one to see frames

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:37,060
and the next stitch is Vampira but

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:40,300
feeling is very um - I don't want be

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:45,340
like Newsies don't want you being on tag

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,849
to distribute receive the frames but

00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:53,169
among we don't use these MAC address to

00:05:48,849 --> 00:06:00,550
distribute frames so this is called my

00:05:53,169 --> 00:06:04,870
freedom it has four types of order and

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:10,690
you can see there's a breeze mode so it

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:13,810
can work as police and what we are you

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:17,650
tease you just featuring if it is

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:22,990
supported physical device instead of

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:27,630
romiska smaller you just filtering

00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:31,539
allows needs to receive much from others

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:36,430
but we don't knows which mcalary's is

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:38,849
needed so it's enough to use you just

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,849
feature

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:49,039
without bridge Maurice lightweight

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:56,060
bridge it has come also swanee no STV

00:06:49,039 --> 00:07:02,020
and only one click and it allows traffic

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,020
between my visions so this is a bridge

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:16,560
and we use man beat up instead of avila

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:20,370
the virtualization very concrete up is

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,979
our top line forbidden variant it

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,479
combats for interception to fire me if I

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,479
write to having transmission

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:43,560
and the sausage is open beseech the most

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:48,030
important creature open messages oh it's

00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:52,710
a photo below but it can be used as a

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:55,190
message as well with many features VLAN

00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:07,920
tagging each time you need

00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:13,220
GRE exploring is based on flawless it

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,220
does so table in the corner instead of

00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,670
what

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:32,210
but note that there is a lot shown they

00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:35,470
use a space such as pbbt but I I don't

00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,470
introduce here

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:49,410
and the last one is equally teach in a

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:55,920
selfie device yes I am sro be enables us

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:57,990
to add lightweight body functions DF in

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,790
addition to PC a normal physical

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:05,540
function Pierre and me from Piazzolla

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:10,100
network interface like it's a zero zero

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:13,940
is a zero and some nice array of

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:20,600
universities hard switch is it them

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,600
so it was 58 or used to be computation

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,170
we can use PCA pass through to a dispute

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,170
to guest

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:42,180
okay now I'll show you use on DP as a

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:48,060
comment for it there are there are CBI's

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:51,000
I have C here C surface a link link is

00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,990
required for new features communities

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,940
extensible sometimes this it is

00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:03,420
something used for so and there are two

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:08,550
types of commands be our CTO in Brazil

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:12,840
tools using ioctl a sea surface and I'm

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:16,070
the Enbridge commands in IP routes to it

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,070
uses Network

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:30,690
when using traditional b el sitio you

00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:38,519
use these commands we are scintilla year

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:43,320
the great new breed yes and yes amongst

00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,839
to show individuals these operations can

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,820
be performed by let's link paste command

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,579
of the world it's kind of treat myself

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:58,019
for example to great reach you can use

00:10:53,579 --> 00:11:01,380
like a link on reached i degrees and I

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:07,100
see what actually supports I'm feeling

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:12,899
safe master and showing to be entries

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:15,990
against breach xpv choke on a recent

00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:19,620
features can only be used by ethnic

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:25,320
patrons sisyphus front such as British

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:29,029
TV Ottawa bridge video art I introduce

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,029
these commands later

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:41,120
and yeah recent feature the breach in

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,410
migration didn't really like the control

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,410
no promises British

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:57,620
the first feature is active in migration

00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:02,690
FTP is a shortfall for in database or

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,840
filtered database and the Bridget is

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:17,510
this - dummy fixed point

00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:22,730
- for example in this table data entry

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:27,460
with Mercedes disability so if it

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:32,770
receives the destination is this one

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:39,110
worry - Easter and which creates these

00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:46,970
entries by logic where it receives a

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:53,330
packet so this pocket is coming from ABC

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:58,060
TV waves and incoming foreign is so the

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,060
destination photo is a catharsis

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:11,690
and if separate species that will be

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:14,579
level then it floods conceived brain but

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:21,350
 too old for its part in common

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:25,760
ones and we can multiply this table by

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:32,959
pretty achieved a big month but it is

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,959
come to use because those companies

00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:47,570
so what Tim I'm sorry

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:53,970
yeah three types of FTP injuries

00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:59,070
Pomerance and study and others which is

00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:03,740
dynamically learned by purgatorial then

00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:07,640
means storage yeah rejected is devotees

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:12,329
Commons a permanent means they've got

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:17,279
preach device it doesn't tell about to

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:19,730
this very important so if you are right

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,730
entry

00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:29,770
if the entry if the if our framing frame

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:39,880
punches reentry then the frame will be

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:42,690
awarded to be a zero instead so probably

00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,690
you eat it

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:52,300
and what's my stomach they care about

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:59,020
this come on transport we can use IP

00:14:52,300 --> 00:15:04,780
Vincent master Oh master is the bridge

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:09,760
to the bridge voice and Bridget if need

00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:14,800
be c'mon Steve Ortiz self self box entry

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:19,540
to space part for yourselves so if

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,730
that's our entry not to the bridge but

00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,730
dude is heresy

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,860
we don't muster

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:38,910
they are going to yourself it is for you

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:44,580
just mad I just filtering food it's

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:57,200
already embarrassing and HIV useful pdb

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:57,200
mktg table if it's all this is I suppose

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:13,680
in 2005 five example so some people

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:18,630
think amusing both agenda sorry of that

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:21,570
determination to be years and in this

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:26,250
environment in bridge boots is taro into

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:38,760
promise just body brothers for me is

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:44,280
goes to Walia Hardy spray me is part

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:47,220
into wire because the inverse which

00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:51,120
doesn't know the mccrary's

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:53,720
behind the bridge so what is what is

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,720
awarded

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:06,370
so you can use protected yard for this

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:10,350
case and drop it away will be boarded

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,350
the bridge we are done

00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:22,970
but in this case we wanted to hijack

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,290
this traffic from the bath hi job do you

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:26,690
say that you want the traffic to be

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:30,220
folded to the bridge but this MAC

00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,220
address belongs to the virtual function

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,970
in your example this MAC address to whom

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,430
does it belong to the virtual function

00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,430
up to the physical function others

00:17:51,030 --> 00:18:05,640
so if we don't that entry to zero

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:09,120
instead of doesn't know it has marketers

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:15,230
behind the breeze so it needs an

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:17,820
filtering filtering entry in this device

00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,530
it's but to whom this MAC address belong

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:25,950
to the further to this virtual link

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:27,360
which is on top of our this profession

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:33,330
unless you add it to the bridge it's not

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:38,700
fraud is right yes my fate belongs to

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:42,960
get one so the first doesn't know my

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:50,910
babies yeah because the doesn't

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:57,290
love doesn't technically so let's count

00:18:50,910 --> 00:19:05,000
for if they must be facing on the Easter

00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:05,000
so we have to have short

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,120
yeah

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,549
driver for ek0 is responsible

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:52,410
one two three three features in the

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:55,290
breeze the first one is suppose to be in

00:20:52,410 --> 00:21:01,860
the second one is for what is according

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:06,559
to be others so the party Nene has be on

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:09,920
comms and something and street invaders

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,920
in the bridge

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:30,930
so I'll explain how this victory is how

00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:41,250
these 15 bucks they're filtering table

00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:45,690
in the bridge like this and we can set a

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:55,110
lot of villains for each port for

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:57,900
example in this case he still has all of

00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:22,680
the villains that is allowed in this

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:29,220
case if it can be bought it but when it

00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:35,880
goes to one doesn't allow we don't

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:39,270
answer in this filter is purple party

00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:45,510
number C and D for kids these are all

00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:49,230
villains but since cannons 3.18 really

00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:51,980
wants a party put so all n ur of

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,980
the except Oh

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,820
and we can use the VAD to insult be on

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,820
top

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:17,070
Gianni's and short for me any other

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:21,990
pocket is a sign disability this is

00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:29,370
purple configuration so you can sit only

00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:35,220
one theory for each book before TV is

00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:37,830
one is kind of 340b Falconer 3.18 able

00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:45,660
to head east and so on but it's a solid

00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:51,210
value it and you can use egress policy

00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:53,310
Anton's two three billion tons outgoing

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,070
packets that much in this policy they

00:23:53,310 --> 00:24:01,010
thought that this is problem of evil

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,010
person so you can sit

00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:14,669
we don't then on top and then 20 both

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:14,669
both villains champion that

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:28,860
these are common for real he checks we

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:31,110
never be on returning right one to reach

00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:35,670
a speed of new training since we'll see

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:44,190
safe a century and to what end delete be

00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:48,390
Lance gains breach in our comment to sit

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:52,280
PP area and under we also use face

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:57,600
beyond mountains and to some settings

00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:03,840
please be on show on account used and

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:09,500
note that if you want to cut entry to

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,500
reach device then you need self QR

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:21,810
this is a traditional configuration of

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:25,970
feed on weight again before we don't

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:28,980
feature and we need bridge device and

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:37,310
video devices for it

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:37,310
villains now we need only one reach

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,009
and other cities

00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:55,409
hundreds and hundreds and some maybe 600

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,409
also

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:05,050
and the next features London flat in

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:10,590
control this feature can lead marketer

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:10,590
sees dis can use and reduce HDD size

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:23,050
this is used with sorry quickly the

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:27,580
entry to disable is along in the future

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:37,500
to disable even one part of Ortiz so I

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:40,890
may need to if if we disable it yeah we

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,890
really entered

00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:55,029
and the future to not flood unknown to

00:26:49,549 --> 00:27:01,549
this powerful is also implemented in 311

00:26:55,029 --> 00:27:04,519
it comes roll pocket to worry to get we

00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:07,570
can use bridge link say two months to

00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:07,570
see severities

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:21,380
and next one is no princess bridge if

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:24,310
there is only one learning of what

00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:27,350
important it can be known promiscuous

00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:31,270
and instead of promised us more in just

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:35,150
written said for study of debian trees

00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:40,220
and this feature is automatically

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:43,310
enabled if meeting three conditions one

00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:48,140
is there is one order learning of what

00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:50,660
importer and the second one is bridget

00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,340
searle is not very smooth and the last

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,340
one is millimeter Museum

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:09,720
and the last feature introduced is don't

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:12,410
ye suffer for reach into to talk to

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,600
idealize stopped beyond us

00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:19,860
in addition to normal to thank you that

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,050
we can you stop line it up and this out

00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,950
why meet them can be used different

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:40,680
customers is to be long to customize

00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:42,570
saying that's my excuse is arena a two

00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,060
to the power two third can be used

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:48,510
inside customers so customized and why

00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:51,080
can you see any good marketer this can

00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:55,800
be enabled by writing

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:59,240
0x8 into a days to preach is enough for

00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,240
two courses a century

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:15,150
this is an example configuration this

00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:19,520
case since frames PID sati and which

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:29,760
preserves the Vienna 30 and in such

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:35,460
editing this reality is used in network

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:42,240
to separate customers and the other in

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:46,820
station cannot receive the original

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,820
pocket which via inside

00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:59,609
now I set up this bridge in my hand

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,620
so

00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,530
this is a environment with children and

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:53,710
because he like

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,710
this environment

00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,570
so

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:30,820
I'm sorry can we get a mic if anybody

00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:40,150
wants to ask a question

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:40,150
white Isabel now we already have

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:52,600
and create a breeze

00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,990
okay as I feeling one two three

00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,560
and a touch

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,550
then

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:31,810
the Bridgeport is very interesting this

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,810
is normal behavior

00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:39,760
I'm they never be lucky

00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,510
then he said their own left runs gets

00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:09,320
more temporary because yeah no other

00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:11,950
free sports there are Dutch Kasich to

00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,950
the bridge

00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:26,539
after touching bn0

00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:29,230
to the bridge is the rain dust from

00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,230
spawn again

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,270
let me start out just

00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:55,420
then we need to disable something and

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:59,650
learning the beetle in zero and we need

00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:05,200
to disable promise Christmas party bar

00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:10,050
and dudn't we need study if they in

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,050
three to four pockets

00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,310
sorry

00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:20,430
I have to shake my brothers

00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,860
Oh

00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:45,060
sorry the team that was done when I show

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,060
us those

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,740
okay sorry I can't recover the question

00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:27,140
demonstrate these commands but I done

00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:27,140
this I can't stand these so if you said

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:37,400
take et cetera will enter nonprofits gas

00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,400
water

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:56,360
actually we bought count 100 these

00:36:51,170 --> 00:37:04,010
settings by the marketing manager today

00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:07,130
but the diversity means not be but the

00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:12,250
deportees kind so we change this

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:17,350
parameter to be but then the report can

00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,350
complete all these

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,780
and there are some Morris who wants

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:32,330
recent comments

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:38,470
the first one is filter empty dump

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:51,440
harbor is important you can filter the

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:58,730
entries prints by year by year 40 and

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:59,870
beyond Lane range is implemented in 3.20

00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:04,130
hours in common

00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:09,190
it cannot be lanced much the villains at

00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,190
once and show me

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:29,750
Inigo but go back to the previous slide

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,820
so why did you hurt your painters MAC

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,160
addresses these are eventually the MAC

00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,570
addresses of the guest which are I mean

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,190
they were to configure the same

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:40,760
archivist to the tap device into the

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:44,690
guest when you do raid of the behind

00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:54,140
depend so if we need infinite or top

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:56,000
devices right yes but these tap devices

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,550
by default to have the MAC address of

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,460
the guests so if the bridge is put into

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:05,770
non promises well they can just but you

00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,770
have to add another addressed to the

00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:24,170
isn't delivered by default configured to

00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:34,520
say MAC address to the tap device the

00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:37,480
bridge of the local entry so the the

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,050
fragment to this and this MAC addresses

00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:44,050
will be poured into bridge device in

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,050
these

00:39:54,470 --> 00:40:05,300
like this popplers are we the bridge

00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:09,829
boat is what much karate - Richie safety

00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:16,099
the entry as a permanent injury

00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:20,890
so if we use East among others the same

00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:25,220
us be the same as the case it's one so

00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:28,869
then the traffic to the guest will be

00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,869
for yourself

00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,260
okay this is something

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:58,559
I showed Linux software sages and

00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:03,539
teachers

00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:43,650
I so thank you very much for your

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,930
presentation I think it was very good to

00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:48,510
see what is currently supported in

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:52,250
exposing the way hardware acceleration

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:54,630
this is the Linux networking stack I

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:58,109
know there's a lot of hardware in

00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:01,260
existence that actually can do a lot

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:05,040
more this is pretty basic stuff just

00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:07,260
filtering in kind of packets based on

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,920
pretty many you know properties stuff

00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,599
like directly with editing cues traffic

00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:17,220
management and also more sophisticated

00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,349
stuff do you know maybe somebody no

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,109
onions no anybody working on exposing

00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,240
the more higher level kind of already

00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:27,059
existing hardware combined their stories

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,420
about IX TV it might have to be like to

00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:29,420
do more

00:42:36,079 --> 00:43:55,109
so I'm saying - yeah so so the question

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,710
just saw that everybody's on the same

00:43:55,109 --> 00:44:00,240
page I guess was what other acceleration

00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:03,480
capabilities are there beyond

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,180
effectively the the l2 device models

00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,950
that we've talked about so far so

00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,839
clearly there's a wide spectrum there

00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,680
are things that can be done in mix there

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,819
are things that can be done in userspace

00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,829
libraries there are things that can be

00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,420
done on switch Asics so we're going to

00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:20,270
talk a little bit today about switch

00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,730
Asics the troopers got to talk about

00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:26,300
which ties and mirrors all of this but a

00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:29,160
large count and I'm very high bandwidth

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,569
the hard work of Jamal mentioned that is

00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,369
tomorrow in two parts

00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:36,210
we're going to try and cover things that

00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,769
further extend Hardware offloading for

00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,749
certain capabilities but the important

00:44:37,769 --> 00:44:42,089
thing here is especially for this

00:44:39,749 --> 00:44:44,880
conference even is to think about what

00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:50,220
is the Linux modeling and then what are

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:52,319
the offloads available absolutely I'm

00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,569
saying is know stuff things already

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,130
doing today and hardware I can do which

00:44:54,569 --> 00:45:01,400
is looking for you know the connection

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,400
so thank you for the thanks

00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:12,640
okay

00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:12,640
