	Linux Traffic Control Classifier-Action Subsystem Architecture
Jamal Hadi Salim
February 2015

Description from netdev01.org:
This talk is about the Linux Traffic Control (tc) filter-action subsystem. Although it has been around for about a decade, this subsystem was never formally documented. Given that two other netdev01 talks refer to this subsystem, we feel obligated to discuss the history, architecture and usage of tc filter-actions. We will describe the packet-processing-graph architecture and the underlying extensibility offered; we will further discuss the formal "graph language" that makes it an awesome packet processing architecture (in our view is still technically ahead of heavily marketted approaches like P4 or OF).
