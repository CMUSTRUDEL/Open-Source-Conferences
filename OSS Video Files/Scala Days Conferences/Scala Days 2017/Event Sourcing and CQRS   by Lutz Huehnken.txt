Abstract: 
Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) have been around for a while, but only now it seems they are really becoming “mainstream”, as they are extremely useful patterns for dealing with your applications state in a scalable way. If you’ve never even heard of them, don’t worry: This talk will give an quick introduction to the concepts of Event Sourcing and CQRS from the ground up. 

Once the basics are clear, we are going to have a close look on a Scala framework for these patterns: The Lagom Persistence module that comes as part of the Lagom Microservices Framework. Not only will you see how Lagom makes it easy to use these patterns with Scala, you will also understand what happens under the hood.

Lastly, we’ll look at some challenges that you may face when applying these patterns, as well as have a quick overview of alternative implementations and what to look for when comparing the approaches.
