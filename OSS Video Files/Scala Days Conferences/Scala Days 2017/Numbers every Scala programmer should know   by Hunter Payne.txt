Abstract: 
Writing highly performant code has always been a challenge for programmers. Techniques change and evolve in response to shifts in underlying hardware. For example, before the early '90s it was faster to XOR a register with itself than to set a register to 0. This is no longer the case. Instead, creating fast code is mostly about improving L2 and L3 cache hit rates, aligning data in memory and allowing hardware attached to the I/O bus to move data to main memory concurrently with the CPU. Now, with the advent of Scala, use of immutable data has been touted as the best practice for how to write concurrent code. In this talk, we'll discuss why using immutability may not always be the right choice. We'll also cover when to follow easier models reliant on immutability, the best times to brave the difficulties of synchronization and locks, and when blocking is the right thing to do, even inside of an actor.
