Abstract: 
Let's face it: You may be able to avoid using sbt to build your Scala projects, but you probably don't want to. It's the de-facto standard for Scala projects and is programmed and configured in Scala itself.

We'll develop a simple sbt plugin together and explore some of the concepts of an sbt build's architecture. The goal is to help you better automate your builds in a single environment rather than stringing together scripts and tools.
