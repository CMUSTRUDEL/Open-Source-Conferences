Abstract: 
In the world of distributed microservices, we face many challenges: parallelism, asynchronous boundaries, state management, identity management and consistency deficiencies, to name a few. Of all these problems, consistency, state management, and identity management can be particularly challenging.

In this session, we will discuss the ins and outs of dealing with microservice consistency and distributed state, and identity coherency with techniques like idempotency, eventual and casual consistency, dealing with CAP theorem, single source of truth and distributed domain design.
