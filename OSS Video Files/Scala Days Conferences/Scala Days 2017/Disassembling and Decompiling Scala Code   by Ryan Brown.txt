Abstract: 
Adoption of enterprise Scala often requires educating Java developers. The runtime implications of many Scala features may not be clearly understood. We investigate Java bytecode produced by the Scala compiler to better understand how Scala creates runnable code. We examine Scala language fundamentals, composition and inheritance, scopes, annotations, and Java interoperability. This is achieved using the javap command to disassemble the .class file to look at its signature, a decompiler, and scalac options. Our goal is to demystify language features and produce better runnable code.
