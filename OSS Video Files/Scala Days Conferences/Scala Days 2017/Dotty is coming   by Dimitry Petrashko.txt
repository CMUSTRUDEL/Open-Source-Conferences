Description: 
	This talk was recorded at Scala Days Chicago, 2017. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.

Abstract:
A new Scala is coming, which will introduce new language and library features as well as deprecate some of the old ones. This talk will give advice on how to prepare your codebases to reduce effort needed to migrate, including: 

– usage of what language features should you try to minimize;
– what classes in the standard library should you stay away from;
– what tools will be there to help you, and 
– how you can start migration early to amortize the effort over time.
