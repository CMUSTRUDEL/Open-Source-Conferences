Abstract:
Rust is a language with a new vision of systems programming. It gives you low-level control and predictability but also provides the safety and ergonomics of languages like Scala. The secret sauce is Rust's core notion of "ownership", which enables:

- Memory safety without garbage collection.
- Concurrency without data races.
- Abstraction without overhead.

In this talk, I'll explain ownership and show how Rust uses it to guarantee thread safety, amongst other things. I'll say a bit about integrating Rust code with other languages. And I'll also cover some of the lessons the Rust community has learned in how to do open, consensus-driven language evolution, so that we also achieve:

- Stability without stagnation.
