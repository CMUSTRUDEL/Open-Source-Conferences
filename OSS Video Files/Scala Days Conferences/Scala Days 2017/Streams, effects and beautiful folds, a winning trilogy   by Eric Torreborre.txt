Abstract: 
Most applications are just reading data, transforming it and writing it somewhere else. And there are great libraries in the Scala eco-system to support these use cases: Akka-Stream, fs2, Monix,... But if you look under the hood and try to understand how those libraries work you might be a bit scared by their complexity!

In this talk you will learn how to build a very minimal "streaming library" where all the difficult concerns are left to other libraries: eff for asynchronous computations and resources management, origami for extracting useful data out of the stream. Then you will able to decide how to spend your complexity budget and when you should pay for more powerful abstractions.
