Abstract: 
Dotty is the project name for the next iteration of the Scala language. As we are nearing a first developer preview, this talk will give a summary of the major changes and innovations as they are currently implemented. I will show with many examples how you can increase the legibility and safety of your Scala programs using the new features.
