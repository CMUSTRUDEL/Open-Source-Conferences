Abstract:
Vert.x is a polyglott toolkit to build reactive applications on the JVM. It is based on a simple yet powerful threading concept and provides very easy cluster managed. 
I will introduce the brand new Scala-stack that has just been added to the core framework and opens all its capabilities to the Scala-world. The main topics of this talk will be:
- a walkthrough for the current stack and available modules
- bootstrapping an SBT-Vert.x-project with the provided project blueprint
- running, testing and deploying of Vert.x-microservices
- how Scala enhances the Vert.x programming experience
- a full demo of an elastic Vert.x-cluster 

Expect a lot of code and room for discussions.
