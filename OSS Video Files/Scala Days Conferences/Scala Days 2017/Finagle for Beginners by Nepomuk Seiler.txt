Abstract: 
"Finagle is an extensible RPC system for the JVM, used to construct high-concurrency servers. Finagle implements uniform client and server APIs for several protocols, and is designed for high performance and concurrency." - Finagle docs

This talk gives an introduction to some Finagle core concepts and how to apply them. You will learn the basic idea behind "your server as function", how to use it, how to implement dynamic request routing with Dtabs and how to implement generic request contexts.
