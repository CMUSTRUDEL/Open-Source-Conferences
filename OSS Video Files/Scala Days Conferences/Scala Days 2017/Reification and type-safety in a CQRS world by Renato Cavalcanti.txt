Abstract: 
CQRS applications brings some new challenges for statically typed language lovers since a considerable amount of the modeling effort goes to the definition of Commands and Events as separated entities without direct connection with the main domain model classes. 

The biggest challenge is how to model a domain as an Algebraic Data Type where its operations are modeled as Commands and Events (themselves also ADTs) and have everything defined as a cohesive, well-typed domain.

This can be achieved in different ways: using type parameters, type projection or path dependent types. Each solution has its Pros and Cons that we will visit and discuss in detail.
