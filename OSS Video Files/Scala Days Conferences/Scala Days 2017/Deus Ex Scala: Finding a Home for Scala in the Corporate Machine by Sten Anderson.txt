Abstract: 
Financial Exchanges are all about enabling near real-time market transactions with minimal latency and maximal predictability. In an environment where performance is king, and "zero garbage" and "lock-free" algorithms are the norm, come hear how one team decided to take a different approach using Scala.

This talk is part technical case study, part project postmortem, and part reflections on building a Scala team from the ground up. We'll talk about how Scala can succeed in a highly regulated, generally risk-averse environment, and why it can be worth that risk and lead to a happier, healthier team.

Still not sure if this talk will be worth your time? You might enjoy this talk if you believe in Life Beyond Java, but the rest of your team thinks that Java 8 Lambdas killed Scala and you are looking for moral support.

first of all thanks for coming I would

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,400
not come to a talk this late

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,910
so dedication is high in this room so

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,070
thank you for that everybody I think has

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,810
been giving the same initial slides

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,500
please rate this talk yep please rate

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:25,470
this talk afterward if you are inclined

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:29,250
so its let's kick this off so my name is

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,050
Sten Anderson and I work for CME Group

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,040
here in Chicago the Chicago Mercantile

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,989
Exchange I work for the exchanges a

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,960
finance the largest financial

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,969
derivatives exchange in the world

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,879
generally a very risk-averse place to

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,010
work generally a Java shop hard to

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,760
introduce new technology but possible

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:53,850
and that's what this talk is about my

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,309
journey with bringing technology like

00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,870
Scala specifically Scala into a

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,300
generally risk-averse corporate

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,699
environment this is not a case study

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,210
this is the last I'll actually pretty

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:09,900
much talk about CNE specifically this

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:15,290
the opinions here are my own it should

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:18,869
go without saying in any talks that's I

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:23,909
don't represent my company here so

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:29,270
anything controversial or questionable

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:31,650
can be pin directly on me so I guess

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,329
assume this is a scala conference so

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,720
everybody has some familiarity with

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,720
scholars at fairly accurate

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,899
what about Java did you guys come

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,170
through Scala by way of Java yeah so I I

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,780
did that too I am a dyed-in-the-wool

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:52,829
Java guy I'm going on 20 years with Java

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:57,360
and I kind of came through Scala there

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,280
through Java into Scala and this is the

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,229
first scala conference I've been a part

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,180
of and it's refreshing to go to a

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,549
conference that's completely Scala if

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,170
you're wondering kind of what skill

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,770
level of Scala we'll be talking about

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,570
here if you saw Martin Kino

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,780
last night which was excellent he's a

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,000
great teacher if you had any of this

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:22,660
kind of reaction which is home are

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,220
watching xx true and Peaks you're in the

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,810
right place so we're not going to be

00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,310
talked about implicit we're not gonna be

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,460
talking about advanced scholar features

00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,100
we are going to be more recognizing that

00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,590
really there's a lot going on here and I

00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,300
have no idea what's going on so this is

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,250
not a deep dive into scholar this is the

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:44,110
beginner track and this is not a code

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:46,150
heavy session so an alternate title for

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,980
this talk was blows yourself Escala team

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,560
in five years or more figured that

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,120
wouldn't get through as much but that

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,250
really is kind of the journey where

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,300
we're talking about here this is a long

00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:03,090
arduous and at times very unrewarding

00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:05,980
thing to do to try to penetrate a new

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,500
inject a new language or technology like

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,480
Scylla into a very corporate environment

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,970
so I promise this is the only bullet

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,880
pointed slide here these are these are

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,370
very visual slides not a whole lot of

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,520
text but just a level set what we're

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,810
talking about here we I want to identify

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,190
what I mean by a corporate environment

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,380
because that means different things to

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,010
different people and then why care about

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,580
Scala

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:34,600
at all and then provided we pass through

00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,980
those two gates that we want to do Scala

00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,260
and we know what kind of corporate

00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,810
environment we're talking about how can

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,800
we win over our peers or management and

00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,990
the environment ourselves itself so

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,810
let's dive right into that presumably

00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:52,000
we're all employed and we all have at a

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,250
company maybe a corporation maybe not

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,530
and you have some role to play in there

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,520
maybe you're the CTO of a start-up and

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,959
if this is where you work I will not be

00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,630
offended if you walk out because this

00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,770
talk will be not relevant to you if you

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,980
have complete control over your

00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,630
technology stack and you can tell your

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,580
developers what you want to do without

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,700
question and you get full buy-in from

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,190
management or you are management you

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:22,280
will not get as much out of this talk

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:25,120
however if you are

00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,470
familiar with the soul-sucking

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,770
[Music]

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:34,370
fluorescent lights you know we should

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:37,490
please stay so but even this corporate

00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:39,920
environment is a little - this is a

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,480
little too stale and you would be

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,190
difficult to introduce anything into

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,590
this this is more of the sweet spot so

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,800
this is a corporation has probably been

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,390
here but is now realizing that open

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,450
floor plans are a good thing everybody

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,320
likes air on Herman Miller chairs

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,030
nobody's sitting in these yet but

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,710
they've built it out and it's kind of

00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,810
ready to go they probably have an

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,400
Innovation Lab and it probably says

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,960
Innovation Lab and you can go and

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,900
innovate there for a couple hours a day

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,050
on your on your own time so like kind of

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,550
a corporation that's working up to the

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,930
industry buzzwords anyway so you know

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,610
because it's the end of the day it's

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,660
time to time to laugh a little bit

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,520
hopefully I'm not sure I know a lot of

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,060
people are here from out of town but in

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,060
the Midwest especially and the the onion

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,560
is a popular satirical paper I want to

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:34,520
say fake news but that means something

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,680
else nowadays that's some fake news so I

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,710
want to describe the corporate

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,360
environment I'm talking about in

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,419
satirical onion headlines if you find

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,950
yourself chuckling at them then you're

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:48,110
in the right place so let's get right

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,390
into that so manager accidentally refers

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,030
to his team is agile without using air

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,669
quotes if that is something that you

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,830
would all relate to the overuse of the

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,560
word a July 10 you're in the right place

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,080
data scientist discovers that big data

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,940
is really just regular-sized data but

00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,229
more of it information security

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,419
accidentally creates password policy so

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:14,000
complex it opens a portal to the upside

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,290
down this is a stranger's thing thing if

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,440
you haven't seen strangers things won't

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,140
be funny so but password policies are

00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,120
are complex developer put getting new

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,590
Mac from IT right up there with the

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,440
birth of first child as one of life's

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,380
best moments the new Mac's are very

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,760
slick so it's understandable

00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,130
and finally and thank you for bearing

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,039
with us manager disappointed that

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,270
management

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,319
for it is really just another boring

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,969
list not an actual dashboard so if

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,559
you've dealt with management dashboards

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:45,809
at all our managers that say like I just

00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:50,189
want to dashboard of this stuff that's

00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:51,360
that's very very appropriate so you so

00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:53,279
if you relate to any of that or

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,349
understand any of that this is where

00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,719
you're going to probably find yourself

00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:00,629
on an org chart somewhere definitely not

00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:03,539
at the top probably somewhere towards

00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:06,119
the bottom or or or middle if you're

00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:07,979
lucky so this is kind of who you are and

00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:11,279
where you work or have been able to

00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,460
relate to that so before we talk about

00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:18,599
how to get stuff in there it might be

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:21,419
worthwhile to ask why Scala at all right

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:24,389
so this talk actually has a number of

00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,300
different flavors the flavor of this

00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:29,490
talk will not dive a lot into why you

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,990
would want to use Scala because you are

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,289
here at a Scala conference you've

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:37,289
probably answered that for yourself in

00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:40,620
your quiet moments so but let's talk

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:43,469
about it anyway because selling to

00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,169
others is an important part of the whole

00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:47,999
process so let's take a small segue and

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,729
talk about Chuck Klosterman so Chuck

00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:53,879
Klosterman anybody familiar with him he

00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:57,509
writes about okay one person thing he

00:07:53,879 --> 00:08:00,809
writes about popular popular culture he

00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,969
writes essays about pop culture so you

00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:05,069
know like the depth of rock and roll and

00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:06,990
all these other things so in his latest

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,089
book which is intentionally upside down

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,180
that's not oh that's just that's just

00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:16,740
cute he's a quirky guy but what if we're

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:19,259
wrong he he asked the question hundreds

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,089
of years from now long after the genre

00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,069
of rock and roll is dead who will we

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:27,120
remember as the quintessential rock and

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:30,120
roller and he argues that there will be

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,089
one and in the middle of the rock and

00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,319
roll genre as we are right now do it's

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,300
easy for us to say like what are you

00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:38,159
talking about even all these artists

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,120
right here Beyonce and Hendrix are

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,250
nothing alike

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,370
how could we distill the entire genre

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,829
into one per squint essential person but

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,550
he argues we do this all the time so

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:51,370
classical which spanned

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,110
which has spanned hundreds more years

00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:56,260
than Rock has we've already started

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:58,030
narrowing it down can anybody name more

00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,950
than three people on here for example

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:03,160
it's just rhetorical you don't have to

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:04,960
actually do it but but this was about

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,850
all I could do right so these are the

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,220
heavy hitters of classical but there are

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,320
a lot more than this and certainly in

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,290
the day when Baroque music would have

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:19,960
been very popular there were a lot of

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:22,210
different composers I'm sure so we do it

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:25,720
even outside of of things like music

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:30,130
anybody notice who this cat is yes is

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,800
Edison what it doesn't do a lot right

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,870
this that's what that is the correct

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,810
answer so he did a lot but what do we

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,820
popularly remember him for the invention

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,290
of the light bulb right but he didn't

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,240
invent the light bulb but we do

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,830
attribute that to him he also didn't

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,380
invent the power grid he didn't invent

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,060
AC or DC power he didn't invent the

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,890
Telegraph which for some reason we

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,260
attribute to them as well we attributed

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:57,970
all those things to Edison because it's

00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,230
convenient and we like to we like to we

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,650
don't want to remember all the other

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:06,280
people we barely have room for for Tesla

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,750
in there as like a contemporary but no

00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,150
more than that really I mean that's

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,670
about as much capacity as we have to

00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,070
remember a guy who did power right so

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,110
but we write Edison was he was a

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,330
prolific event inventor and businessman

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,260
he popularized a lot of the stuff he

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:25,960
didn't invent it though so so what

00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,700
Klosterman would say is we aren't

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,140
because we're in the middle of rock I'm

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,470
still talking about rock I know right

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,150
but it's after 6:00 was right so because

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,560
we're in the middle of the genre we are

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,910
not in a position we can't even guess

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,880
who's going to be the most influential

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:43,990
rocker but we can we are in a position

00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,570
to say who the last will be and he says

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,190
the last rock and rollers Eddie Van

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,200
Halen so I happen to be a fan of Eddie

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,480
Van Halen and so I had to twist them

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,820
into the talks of how and this is going

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,980
somewhere but he's saying there of

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,470
course will be more bands or of course

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,900
will be better guitarists

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,240
sir Eddie there will be more popular

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,370
bands probably after Eddie but there

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,480
will not be another Eddie Van Halen's

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,540
there will not be another one that

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:15,100
another person that captured the

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,960
imagination of teenage boys who wanted

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,500
to learn the guitar in the in the 70s

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,150
and 80s so he is the last his essay is

00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:28,050
called Eddie Van Halen is the last

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:30,430
guitar hero so awkward segue just like

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,220
like we're talking about who the last is

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,140
of a genre there are a lot of languages

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,210
and at some point there will be a last

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:41,740
programming language there will be a

00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:44,080
language thank you for living there will

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,530
be a last programming language at some

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,610
point

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,960
no I'm serious thank you for living we

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,100
don't know what that's going to be yet

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,480
but at some point computers will

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,890
probably start programming programming

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,840
themselves the von Neumann architecture

00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,010
isn't going to be relevant for us

00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,300
anymore

00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,710
so there'll be a last program

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,870
programming language it will be

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,790
something else at some point of course

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,330
we are in the middle of it right now so

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,920
we can't say what the quintessential

00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:13,270
programming language is yet but similar

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,370
to the rock analogy I say based on that

00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,530
cognitive bias slide that was in the

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,390
beginning we are in a position to know

00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,160
what the last programming language is

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,610
not the quintessential one but the last

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,760
one we are I think now at a point where

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,200
the programming zeitgeist has moved on

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,420
to a point where there will never be a

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,400
single dominant language again and what

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:38,500
is that language do you think it's not

00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:42,040
Scala so and so I I submit to you that

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:47,680
Java is the last dominant language that

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:51,190
we will ever see for better or worse and

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,010
part of it is it kind of dug its own

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:56,140
grave in a way so Java is a design by

00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,250
language or design mycommittee language

00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:01,660
it is a I mean they all you need to do

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,730
is look at how long it took them to

00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:05,360
decide on the

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,740
implementation right they had like the

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,270
three competing lambda implementations

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,820
years I think they even delayed a major

00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:17,570
version before they actually got it in

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:20,740
so Java is dominant now but it's it's

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:24,290
its dominance has now bid it and it will

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:27,230
not it's innovation is kind of stalled

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,870
and it's not going to be it'll always be

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,490
around like COBOL is still around and C

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,380
is still around but it's not the

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,270
innovative language anymore and in fact

00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:38,000
it ruined it for other languages going

00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:40,460
forward and the reason is because of

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,400
this convenience screenshot from 1997

00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,460
which I knew 20 years ago I was gonna

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,800
given to talk so I snapped it then it

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,820
was the portability of the of the VM

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,370
right so at the time in 1997 it was this

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,920
novel idea like what's the tagline

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,800
what's the sales sheet for job what's

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,650
the tagline for Java right right once

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,770
run anywhere right so that was that was

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,710
shorthand for the JVM and kind of as

00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:12,620
years went on as famous kind of I mean

00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:15,860
Charles mutters famous for pimping this

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:18,980
idea this is so my semi dated but still

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,770
relevant as years went on people realize

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,230
this this VM like Java the language

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,440
actually kind of blows but the V the

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,520
underlying VM the underlying platform is

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:35,810
is it's is its diamond in the rough and

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:37,610
because of this and you read it but the

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,180
gist in time compiler the fast memory

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,710
allocation the garbage collection fully

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,030
native thread support they're all

00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,550
billion dollar investments I mean

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,860
centuries of man manpower had gone into

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:52,040
the intellectual property all sitting on

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,770
our desktops for free so because of the

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,240
JVM and what Java brought with it there

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,960
will never be a single dominant language

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,210
again and because of that we now we now

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,940
brag about being polygon polyglot

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:07,370
programmers right so we're in the age of

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,620
the polygon programmer now and it's very

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,300
popular for people to say like well I'm

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,700
a polygon programmer right let you know

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:16,610
the right language for the right job

00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,959
right I mean that's a very common thing

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:22,370
to say

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:25,490
but but I'm old and and and cranky and I

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,430
I think that's a nice thing to say but I

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,670
think polyglot ism is really difficult

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:35,930
to achieve it's really easy to learn

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:39,140
Scala as a Java programmer it's really

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,990
easy to write Scala as as if you're

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,600
writing Java it's very difficult to

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,360
write idiomatic Scala and I think most

00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,510
people would agree with that it's very

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,459
easy to write groovy like Java it's very

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,290
difficult to write idiomatic groovy or

00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,300
it's more difficult it's more of an

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,310
investment so what I feel like when

00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,990
people say oh yeah I'm a polyglot I

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,050
learn a language every year

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,709
I know 20 languages as I sense what they

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:09,260
mean is I know a language like C my core

00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:11,750
language c-sharp Java something like

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:16,160
that and I write all my other language

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:18,410
is kind of like my home language that's

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,570
not that's not a truism across the board

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,480
there are definitely people who put in

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,970
the effort and do really well by it I've

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,480
just personally found it very difficult

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:33,320
and part of the reason is that we keep

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,540
looking at the same problems as if

00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,060
they're different problems but but in

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,550
reality it's the same problem looking at

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,329
it a different way and this is classic

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,920
object-oriented versus functional

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:46,579
programming right object-oriented

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,920
programming which I would kind of cut my

00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:52,160
teeth on going going through the late

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,199
80s and early 90s you know all the books

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,649
of the time we're like it's so obvious

00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:59,269
the world is a world of nouns so

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,190
everything is an object object oriented

00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,040
programming perfectly models the world

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:07,490
around you but that's that's not true

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,350
and we spend a decade or more unwinding

00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,540
all of that because we don't live in a

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:18,740
world of things necessarily we also live

00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:21,829
in a world of action and nuance so one

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,110
of the things that this Venn diagram

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,390
that I

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,770
shoehorned in is these are the things

00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,410
that are kind of noticed over the past

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,880
20 years you know the the concept of the

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,270
enterprise didn't exist when I started

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,540
working it seemed like as Java grew in

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,070
popularity Enterprise kind of grew in

00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,950
popularity and then things had to be

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,730
enterprise-d and actually the adverb

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,220
enterprise-e

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:49,690
entered that our lexicon usually as an

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,890
insult we had this over overall

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:58,250
object-oriented idea that we were trying

00:17:51,890 --> 00:18:00,710
to play with but then as when you get

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:02,540
any dominant force you always get you

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,490
know the end of the yang right something

00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,080
else comes out of the gutter and so it's

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,080
like wait functional programming it's

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,640
been around since the 50s it's just as

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,210
valid of a way of looking at the world

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:18,980
here comes a list again and and it

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:20,810
became cool to hate on object-oriented

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,520
programming and then you know we get

00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,170
these intersections here in the Java

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,290
world obviously in the c-sharp world

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,660
this would be a different talk but you

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,670
know if in by enterprise here I mean a

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,380
language that you won't be afraid to

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:38,360
bring home to your parents right

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,920
so although closure arguably is weird

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,020
it's just weird

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,950
but anyway certainly enter the closure

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:47,660
is enterprise-e and functional and you

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,540
know java is obviously object-oriented

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,130
and enterprise-e I just had to look up

00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,230
another one that was not enterprising

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,930
and fit in the Java eco sphere and I

00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,590
guess extend it that way but I don't

00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:02,510
know anything about it and because this

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,640
is a Scala conference I put scholar in

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,950
the middle when I want to give this talk

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,090
at the Microsoft I put c-sharp for the

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:13,190
Muslims I don't do that all right so so

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,320
the title of this talk is is a play on

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:19,040
the word play on the phrase deus ex

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:21,980
machina which means got out of the

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,040
machine which is referring to the

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:27,230
literary device of you've got a nice

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,070
little plot going in your play or

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,570
whatever it is and all of a sudden

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,780
something comes out of left field and

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,580
either resolves all the loose ends or

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,770
something unexpected happens comes out

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,730
from outside of the world the

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,670
established world

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,930
it's a God out of the machine so I

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,800
called this deus ex scala to kind of say

00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,480
you know and again this is kind of a

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,510
personal journey over the last 20 years

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,120
or so as I've watched Java take oh you

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,970
know get rise in popularity kind of take

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:03,580
over the enterprise and then fracture

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:05,350
with the polyglot ISM of a lot of the

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,410
cool guys going over to Ruby because

00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,870
they don't like Java Haskell is doing a

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,870
little bit over here c-sharp and you

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,300
know Microsoft they're making a bid for

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:18,940
domination you kind of I don't know

00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,800
we're not out of nowhere but it fits

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,880
with the metaphor so let's just say out

00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,550
of nowhere

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,080
yes Scala it slowly builds momentum and

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,230
Scala is an old language has been around

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,630
for a while almost as long as Java but

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:35,590
it's doing it in kind of on its own

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:37,390
terms and I don't want to say it's not

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,060
selling out because that implies Java

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,520
selling out but it's kind of on its own

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:46,780
terms building its own community slow

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:50,200
and steady but definitely steady and

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:55,270
what I this slide doesn't fit as well

00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:58,120
into this conference because you're

00:20:55,270 --> 00:21:01,660
you're here because you like Scala but

00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,010
in other venues and in this one I would

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,600
say Scala is worth your time to learn

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:07,600
I've learned it at least seven times

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:10,420
myself which means that it's colleagues

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,250
difficult to learn and if and like

00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:15,840
anything if you don't keep using it

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:19,090
you'll forget it and and I found myself

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,610
trying to in the companies I've worked

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,450
for trying to adopt Scala getting a

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,580
project going

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,800
but then Java takes over again for a

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,480
while and then someone's like oh yeah

00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,370
that Scala project that needs help again

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,570
I'm like Tommy and how does that how

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:36,390
does that work again and I end up

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:38,650
relearning the whole thing again but I

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,810
appreciate as difficult as Scala can be

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,490
to learn I and I'm talking about

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,230
idiomatic scholar I'm not just saying

00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,790
like here's the fourth statement in Java

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,250
here's a for statement and

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,300
and in Scala but you know to code

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,060
idiomatic Scala

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,540
I like the philosophy of Scala I want

00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:58,780
Scala to do well because and these

00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:03,970
slides are taken from last year's Scala

00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:07,510
days I think but this I believe this

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:11,350
comes from Martin and he he says here

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:13,120
and I circled that one of the goals for

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,870
the language is to stay simple and

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,540
approachable

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:20,740
that is a great noble goal Scala is a

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,910
very small syntactic language and one of

00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,820
the reasons is they're not afraid to

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,120
drop features they drop and stuff all

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,000
the time

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,830
and I mean what happens when you know

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,170
Scala 2.10 comes out everything breaks

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,080
right and then Scala 2.11 comes out

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,290
everything breaks again but that's great

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,660
Java go because they're so enterprising

00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,390
and so I'm Trent and everything they a

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,450
value backwards-compatibility above all

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:52,570
else they are afraid they're terrified

00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:56,050
and windows 95 did the same or the

00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:00,220
Windows legacy did the same exact thing

00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:02,860
which is why everybody kind of you know

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,720
looks askance at Windows I think Joel

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,750
Spolsky says because he was on the wind

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,240
we're using at Microsoft for a while he

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,610
said windows 95 the operating system

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,010
actually had code to check to see if

00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,110
SimCity was running because it was such

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,570
a popular game at the time and if it was

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,550
running to pretend its memory model

00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,880
looked a certain way so the operating

00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,770
system itself had code for a game at the

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,120
time like that that is hardcore

00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:32,770
backwards compatibility and Java Java

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,090
suffers from the same thing right and I

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,640
think this came up in one of the earlier

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,940
sessions you can't have both you can't

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,450
have a small compact simple language and

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,690
backwards compatibility choose one and I

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,910
think Scala makes the right choice here

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,130
and one of the other reasons about that

00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,740
is it's not only a simple language but

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:57,310
it's a quality language right so these

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,080
are two guitars really I just wanted to

00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,190
talk about

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,279
rakh apparently so I own both these

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:09,169
guitars the one on the right is a PRS

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:11,760
custom 22 the one on the left is a GL

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:14,370
it's that basically as like a

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,380
Stratocaster one is four times more

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,529
expensive than the other the PRS is four

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,510
times more expensive but in just looking

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,640
at them and maybe even listening to them

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,760
you'd be like well that's a ripoff but

00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,799
you you put it on and there's no

00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,289
question which one is the better of the

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:35,519
two it just feels right you know the

00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:38,130
fret board everything about the the PRS

00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,529
makes you want to play longer and that's

00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,860
what I feel like Scala has for me

00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:47,100
personally when I use Scala I want to

00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:50,250
actually code and I want to actually do

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,399
more of it whereas Java it gets the job

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,590
done you know like the GL here but I'm

00:24:53,399 --> 00:25:01,559
ready to kind of stop after a little

00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:04,529
while right so this is a this is an

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,769
example of the quality of Scala and and

00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:10,110
again I know you guys are are

00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:12,630
established Scala experts so I won't

00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:16,919
dwell on this but one of the quality

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:20,639
things about Scala that could preach to

00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:23,669
our teams all the time is everything is

00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:25,860
an object right so not only is

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:28,620
everything in an object but you know

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,299
five plus two that's not that's not

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,669
operator overloading that's just the

00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:38,610
plus method and it's it's a short form

00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:41,159
for $5 to even know as an object and you

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,899
get that with the with with numbers

00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,519
right so in Java everything is not an

00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,840
object you have primitives and if you're

00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,789
a Java programmer the first thing you

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,179
say is like well no there's auto boxing

00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:53,370
so joke's on you but of course that's

00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,950
not true auto boxing is broken all over

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,850
the place and as a quick example the one

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,389
on the left

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,840
it is Scala you declare an int and a

00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:07,080
long and and do they equal each other

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:11,490
they do because it's obvious on the

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,760
right is is Java you declare an int and

00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,980
a lot

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,190
do they double equals each other that's

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,560
a compiler error give a dot equals each

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:22,920
other they happen to but you might get a

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,380
nullpointerexception you know the bottom

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:30,900
one just even dealing with integers with

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:33,630
actual objects declare 2 as 10 to intz

00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,910
as 10 do they equal do they double

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,280
equals each other they do now reassign

00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,260
them to a thousand do they double equal

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:44,670
each other they won't does anybody know

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:49,170
what it is by the way so it was sorry

00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:55,160
good yeah so it's a I don't mean to pick

00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:55,160
on Java but it's it's exemplary of the

00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:02,460
the backwards compatibility issue right

00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:04,200
so the fact that they're so afraid or or

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,530
or have just not afraid but have decided

00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,390
to not break things that they let they

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,000
kind of just let this go and the answer

00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,560
to this is well don't ever use double

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,770
equals right you've got to use dot

00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:19,140
equals but that's that's a that's a

00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,530
that's a poor answer the reason that

00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:25,850
this is the way it is is because

00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,850
integers are pooled below a certain

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,810
below a certain value which i think is

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,000
some sort of power of two like one 128

00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,560
or 256 or something and of course double

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,510
equals is not comparing their equality

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,790
it's comparing their object reference

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,130
equality so that's why it works below a

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:44,190
certain threshold they happen to be the

00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:47,490
same object above a certain number they

00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:50,610
are not the same object so that is not

00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:53,700
what you expect unless you are a Java

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:57,240
compiler nerd so all right so enough

00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,510
about that you're you you want to use

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,650
Scala I mean who doesn't right so I want

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,830
to use Scala I want to use it in my

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:09,570
corporation what do you know what's the

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:13,920
first step so the first step is and I

00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,720
met wander earlier yesterday and he had

00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,630
said like I'm the only guy doing Scala

00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,060
and I completely and utterly commiserate

00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:24,120
and relate to that and I will say that

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,940
is the hardest path to follow to be the

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,519
Scala guy

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,230
it's not dangerous it's just lonely it's

00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,320
lonely and a lot of work because you

00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:38,789
will be the Scala guy doing stuff on

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,279
your own time for the most part and you

00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:43,289
might have to do your day job too and

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,029
more than anything you're going to have

00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:47,580
to deal with Erlich Bachman zuv the

00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:49,139
world so and if you know if you've seen

00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,000
Silicon Valley and you know Erlich

00:28:49,139 --> 00:28:53,700
Bachman voice it's most helpful if you

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,289
read it in his voice so I bet you feel

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,149
foolish now for being the scholar guy

00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:58,740
and now that Java 8 is lambdas so

00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:00,480
somebody actually said this to me at

00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,269
work a few years ago when a Java got

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,950
Lance's so I mean you basically you

00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:07,889
become you can become a caricature of

00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,870
the scala guy right and you you deal

00:29:07,889 --> 00:29:12,870
with a lot of open hostility and a lot

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,870
of dismissiveness too right no one's

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,549
heard this right I mean that's not no of

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,309
course right I mean that's that's like

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:22,470
the number one thing on Stack Overflow

00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:25,379
or anything is like when I looked at

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:29,159
scala for five minutes to academic and

00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:33,149
things like this don't help our cause at

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:36,240
all when we answer questions

00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:39,720
- what's the for-loop in scala when we

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,250
get answers like this I kind of

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,490
understand why people are saying it's

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:46,409
academic I don't read I mean it's

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:49,110
perfectly sensible and all that but he

00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:50,450
if you if you don't know what any of

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,649
this means

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,759
you will either be immediately turned

00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,129
off where you feel like you've got to

00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,799
look a lot of stuff up and part of that

00:29:56,129 --> 00:30:01,409
is the academic nature or the academic

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,509
criticism is that I feel like James

00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:05,250
Gosling it was kind of like the blue the

00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,799
blue collar programmer right and he even

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:10,799
said he even calls this is very early in

00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,230
Javas life in the 90s Java is a blue

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,330
collar language like it gets its it gets

00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,519
stuff done it's no one's going to get

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:21,330
their PhD on Java although I'm sure

00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,159
people have but at the time he was

00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:26,129
probably thinking like this is a work

00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:27,929
this is a work man's language and we're

00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:29,850
not going to we're not going to deal too

00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:32,340
much with the theoretical underpinnings

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,740
of language but I kind of feel like the

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,580
criticism of a language being too

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,240
academic is a little bit like well it's

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,550
almost like

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,280
telling your doctor I'm sorry doctor I

00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,950
think I think you're too qualified to

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,620
operate on me like it's kind of it's a

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,940
weird backhanded like you're too good

00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,150
for this

00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,580
I don't own a sports car but on the rare

00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:59,910
occasion I've sat in them or driven them

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:01,679
or watch them being driven with a tear

00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:06,390
in my eye

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,580
know that it's a lot like a sports car

00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:12,000
right so you've ever driven a sports car

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,590
it's not they handle really well but you

00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,660
got to know what you're doing because

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:18,000
they handle really well they go really

00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,830
fast and they don't have time for you

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,580
like you need to know what you're doing

00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:26,370
and that's a little bit I would call the

00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,600
academia of Scala like Scala is not

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,900
going to make apologies for being

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,620
elegant and awesome and having a strong

00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,990
theoretical underpinning just like a BMW

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,350
is not going to apologize for Ford's

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,790
handling but you get in the car and

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,160
everything is about as you expect and

00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,350
that's what I experienced with Scala and

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,380
that's that's what I feel like a lot of

00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,420
the people that have kind of come it's

00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,380
over into Scala have noticed as well

00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:57,420
that things operate about as you would

00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,600
expect like with the int thing with Java

00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,520
that is a that's a I did not expect that

00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,790
I did not expect a thousand to not equal

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:10,140
thousand but with Scala there isn't that

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:12,570
kind of thing and we're kind of fooling

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,020
ourselves if we convince a if we say

00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,830
that that Scala or that Java is not

00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,230
complex

00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,030
we just have grown accustomed to all the

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,020
accidental complexity so here's a

00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,960
typical stacktrace

00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,450
from an application container and in

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,300
yellow is the actual business logic you

00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,610
care about so we're totally fine with

00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,590
this as Java programmers we just skip

00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,179
through the first few pages we skipped

00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,580
through all the organ at you stuff until

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:43,080
we find combat zme or whatever and like

00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:46,860
oh that's that's where I am that is it's

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,080
not like Scala doesn't have this but we

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:53,790
can't pretend that Java is some sort of

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:55,770
elegance simple straightforward thing

00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:01,770
so as you try to convince others your

00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:03,630
peers to use Scala generally you know in

00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,860
a hostile environment you're either

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,110
going to get people who are kind of

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:08,100
dismissive and say like too academic for

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,900
me not my thing

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,809
or you're the Scala guy I don't need

00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:15,600
that saying things like no but it'll

00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:17,669
make your job easier that's that's

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,970
guaranteed to fail because people don't

00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:23,190
want to be told what to do or they don't

00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,960
want to be told that what what they're

00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:28,260
doing isn't great

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,419
or maybe could be optimized which

00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:34,679
generally more successful at least I

00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:37,220
found and we have a couple a couple of

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:41,880
people from from my my team here today

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:45,240
for support so thank you for that is to

00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,830
try to build a culture around don't die

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,000
don't try to dive right into a project

00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:52,169
don't go to your manager and say I

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,900
really want to do this next project in

00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:56,610
Scala I'm excited to learn it because

00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,580
the manager the first thing a manager is

00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,020
going to say is well after I fire you

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,679
who's going to take over that project

00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,600
right or basically after you leave or

00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,340
when you're not available who's going to

00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,230
support it because the manager is not

00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,280
thinking generally thinking about your

00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:14,639
own well-being in your own

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,710
self-satisfaction they want to know okay

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,530
as a whole what's the team going to do

00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:22,830
here who else is going to do it so you

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:25,770
need you need a culture behind you and a

00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:29,429
good way to do that is to just basically

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:31,440
say basically start saying like I'm I'm

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:35,280
learning Scala if anybody wants it's

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,840
like it's I shoulda thrown the slide in

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,570
here now that I'm thinking about it but

00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,520
it's like Homer when he said all right

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,679
pie I'm just gonna start moving my mouth

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,050
like this and if you end up in it that's

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,639
your own fault um it's the same kind of

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,389
thing where you're like I'm gonna I'm

00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,740
going to be here at a specific time

00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:55,429
you know just futzing around the scallop

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,960
anyone wants to join I mean please do

00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,560
and then you know you might get some

00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,670
magnet

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,530
you know magnetic attraction from there

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,200
for us we dubbed it coding fun time and

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,849
we ultimately built a

00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,829
a tracer from the ground up if you look

00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:11,450
at the actual code you will say like

00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:13,250
well that looks like a Java programmer

00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,550
wrote that and that's true

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,839
we were Java programmers at the time we

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,280
wrote this and we wrote it like Java

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,530
programmers that's fine

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,390
because we weren't doing it alone we

00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:27,880
actually had five and five was our magic

00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:32,119
number for a co supportive group

00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,400
something where if I for several weeks I

00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,730
was not around the group would continue

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,800
and maybe it would just be two people

00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:43,849
who met or three people or one person

00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,890
but the it lives on with without me or

00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:48,290
you specifically and that's really what

00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:51,560
you kind of want is a self-sustaining

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:53,359
group that's going to continue no

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,810
project work yet right this is just

00:35:53,359 --> 00:36:00,200
learning we're just learning i but we're

00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:04,700
kind of learning on the company sly so

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:07,190
to speak so the next step after you kind

00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,690
of figure out like okay there's enough

00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,030
caching on here where we can actually

00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:13,220
compile Scala and write it like Java

00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:14,750
programmers but we realize that we'd be

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:17,540
embarrassed to show an actual Scala

00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:19,010
person this that's when the idiomatic

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,990
piece comes up and that's when you

00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,190
actually start thinking maybe we should

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,390
learn about this functional programming

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:29,510
thing and I'm reminded of of Epiphanes

00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:35,240
right so or what's another word for

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:37,579
epiphany revelations realizations so I

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,369
remember my mentor when I was in my

00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:43,069
first or second year of programming he

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:44,450
just kind of offhandedly said he's like

00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:46,190
well yeah every time you have an if

00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:48,520
statement that's usually an indication

00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,980
that there's a more object-oriented

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:55,160
solution you know at hand there if

00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:58,520
statements are a code smell and at the

00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,960
time I was like yes I know totally

00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,790
but I no idea what he's talking about so

00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,490
but of course this turns into just

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,920
general polymorphism after a while but

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,270
the point is you feel like you're an

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,859
object-oriented programmer and then

00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,869
someone drops something like that on you

00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:17,480
and you're like yeah okay yeah I got you

00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:19,440
and you actually internalize it and use

00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,910
it the same thing

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,650
with functional programming where you

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,200
can kind of do all the intro stuff and

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,839
say yeah functional programming

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,880
well functional state is bad right with

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,140
functional programming so I guess I'm

00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,760
just going to be a bad functional

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,670
programmer because I need state but it

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,650
turns out that's not true and this was

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,920
this was a personal point of epiphany

00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:42,930
for me was state is not at odds of

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,849
functional programming side effects

00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,039
might be but not state and when you get

00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:50,160
state in the mix you get repeatability

00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,690
and you get usefulness and you can

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,819
actually start doing things and testing

00:37:51,690 --> 00:38:00,839
things I did not come up with that

00:37:55,819 --> 00:38:03,990
myself that was I and if you read if you

00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:05,339
read one book this year this is a great

00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,630
book this functional programming in

00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,880
Scala I feel like I'm late to the party

00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,250
this one has been around for a while and

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,740
just came up in another talk and

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,240
everybody was like oh yeah I have my

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,309
copy or whatever but anyway in case

00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,950
you're late to the party like me this is

00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:21,299
a great book it builds functional

00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:23,880
programming kind of from first

00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:28,260
principles and I I kind of like that so

00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:31,230
after a while of all that you you start

00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,279
thinking functionally and things but you

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,260
are and you already know the Scala

00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:38,400
syntax you already have a support group

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,460
you have people of like-minded intention

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,940
and you have this positive feedback loop

00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:46,619
that starts and you feel like I'm ready

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,539
to do something I'm ready to do an

00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,920
actual project and you and you wait and

00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:51,599
you remember you're in this corporate

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,130
environment and there's you're in your

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,010
cubes and there's a lot of risk and

00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,869
we're a Java shop and projects are

00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:00,349
coming but I'm just kind of waiting in

00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:02,520
the sly building this team and stealth

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:05,880
figuring out functional programming and

00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,710
then finally a project comes and you

00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,299
know and it fits right in with where you

00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:11,010
want what you want to do and yeah you

00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:14,010
could do it in Java but maybe there's

00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:16,020
this little thing that makes it a little

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,549
bit more compelling to do with Scala and

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,650
you got your team all ready to go and

00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:26,400
now it's time to go to management

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:28,410
so these guy were looking people are not

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,279
gonna care about Scotland and they're

00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,089
not going to care about your

00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,470
satisfaction

00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:33,210
they're not going to care about your

00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,320
team and I and I

00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,420
means like we all care about each

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,700
other's human beings but your manager

00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,680
has different concerns than you do

00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,400
this is what your manager cares about

00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:49,740
your manager cares about pie charts and

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:53,760
bar charts and jokes from xkcd now I'll

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:55,260
let you read them slides so they're

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,630
going to care about things like this and

00:39:55,260 --> 00:40:00,120
this is a great slide because it looks

00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:03,240
like scholars taken off its dominating

00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,040
but the the parentheses here if you look

00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,890
at the compete the competition here I

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,540
mean the kind of the parentheses is in

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,260
the small world of functional

00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:13,620
programming

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,360
so yeah Scala is taking off there are

00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,970
two more jobs this year than there were

00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,730
last year so but that's okay it's tell

00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:24,060
compelling chart and you know this is

00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,040
from the stack overflow developer survey

00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,900
you know you can't really use this stuff

00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,520
but managers don't know it you could

00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,000
just kind of give it to them say like

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,920
look it's the fourth most loved language

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,230
people really love this stuff

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,820
and you know here's the the Redmont

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,680
thing that comes out every quarter and

00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,670
Scala is always trending up kind of

00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:48,780
toward toward there and that's that's

00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:51,300
all well and good but the the problem

00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,130
with this is a managers going to want to

00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,370
know like fine can I hire Scala

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:59,940
developers well I mean technically I

00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:01,530
mean people put it on the resume but but

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,270
good news you don't have to hire them I

00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,770
got these guys all ready to go and we've

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,780
been doing this thing doing this on

00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:10,320
company time it's like you're asking too

00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:13,620
many questions so but you know the idea

00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,720
is you you the point is with managers

00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,240
you have to know your audience you win

00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,810
managers with data with don't worry this

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,670
is not risky this is just Java it lives

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:26,910
on Java compiles down to Java it plays

00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:29,190
well in our system and you know and the

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,960
team will do it and we know we've got we

00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:33,330
don't we already know it we know it well

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,550
enough to learn to use it it's a small

00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:37,380
project it's very self-contained so

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,870
you've passed the second hurdle you got

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,150
people you got management buy-in which

00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:44,180
really just means don't prove your

00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:49,700
timesheets and

00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:52,039
now what's the block you hit with with a

00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,319
corporate world if you get management

00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:57,109
buy-in and you got your developer peers

00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:02,349
there's still someone you need to win

00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:04,849
over and that's that's these guys so

00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:06,829
hopefully the only way this is going to

00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:11,470
work with your Ops guys with your DBAs

00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:15,200
with your with your Ops guys and your

00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:17,839
your system engineers basically the only

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:23,420
way that they will give you the time of

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:25,789
day is if you have DevOps so I hate to

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,170
say like you know you got DevOps right

00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:29,270
because everybody's doing DevOps because

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,480
DevOps doesn't mean anything but what I

00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:34,640
mean here is is continuous delivery so

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,089
you've got some amount of deployment

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,210
pipeline

00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:39,589
you're not just ad hoc throwing jars

00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:42,529
into production or in different

00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:46,010
environments if you have an actual

00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:48,319
deployment pipeline that loves and

00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,299
understands Java and other things and

00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,150
this is I guess you know docker can come

00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:57,109
into this but at sea we don't use docker

00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:58,760
we we have our own of course seemi does

00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:01,339
everything from scratch by itself

00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,859
because that is the least efficient way

00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:08,720
to do it and I'm glad this is being

00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:11,260
recorded so we we write our own tools

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,490
thank you very much and they love Java

00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,289
but with that's a good that's good news

00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,599
because what do you tell your Ops guys

00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:19,369
oh is this Java it's just you're going

00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,420
to see Scala all da jar in there but

00:43:19,369 --> 00:43:25,279
just a jar it's whatever and we actually

00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,690
have a production support team when

00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:28,430
things go when things throw exceptions

00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:32,059
in production because the markets are

00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:32,960
open 24/7 the production support team is

00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:34,309
going to get it they're going to see

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,289
stack traces and they're going to have

00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:37,760
Scala package names in there but that's

00:43:36,289 --> 00:43:40,220
okay because you take them out the

00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,869
coffee and you say like it's either you

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,630
read it just like scholar you read it

00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:47,809
just like Java I mean you know here it's

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,520
basically the same thing so that's

00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:51,559
actually usually in my experience that's

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,020
not a very difficult sell well because

00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:55,400
of the Java linkage there and if you're

00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,470
lucky and if you're doing great and I

00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,040
realize I'm running out of time

00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:01,359
so I'm just going to blow through this

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,400
you get to do an actual project and

00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,380
that's that's kind of the culmination

00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,000
this is not a case study but if it were

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:10,150
a case study this is where that talk

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,580
would start which is this is a project

00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:17,800
we were able to do with a team of five

00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:21,130
developers a market State Service micro

00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:25,599
service with with akka it was heavy

00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:27,220
heavy with the message passing and

00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,200
concurrency and persistent data

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:32,849
structures and there isn't a

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:37,060
synchronized keyword in in the house and

00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:39,040
you know was a great I don't know if it

00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,960
was great but it was ours you know it

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:45,369
was a child and that we that we loved so

00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,930
but but what's important is there's

00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:52,270
application out now in our pipeline that

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,520
the trail has been blazed for future

00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:56,740
projects to come through there is now

00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,599
and and our information security guys

00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,950
wanted to know like well we scan all the

00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,300
code and we don't know how to scan

00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,150
scholar code so we don't know if your

00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,980
code is secure like well it sounds like

00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:06,940
you've got a problem then InfoSec

00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,940
because there's going to be more of this

00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:13,119
stuff coming down don't ever talk back

00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,680
to enforce a fit you get the idea

00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,589
so anyway so that's kind of where we

00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:21,609
ended up and the journey we took to get

00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:23,830
there so so thanks for going on this

00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:26,410
journey with me I don't have a summary

00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,869
slide all I have is kind of I usually

00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:30,580
end with some sort of like I've been at

00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:33,760
this for 20 years maybe I'll be at it

00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:36,040
for 20 more years kind of reflection on

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,920
my own mortality but I realized that

00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,609
there are fewer lines of code ahead of

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:46,150
me than behind and this is the classic

00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:48,760
Olin Mills 80s picture I'm the I'm the

00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:51,339
attractive guy in the up there on the

00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,869
top and you know this was right around

00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:57,490
and I started getting into programming

00:45:52,869 --> 00:46:00,040
on the Apple 2e and and I begged my dad

00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,359
for a computer and my dad was a truck

00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,710
driver at the time and he's like what

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:06,250
you need computers for there's no future

00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:07,119
in that but eventually we got a

00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,339
hand-me-down

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,029
Texas's or ti-89 I think it

00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:14,829
was and it had it was the cartridges you

00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:17,680
could save programs if you had an actual

00:46:14,829 --> 00:46:20,140
tape recorder with a with a with a plug

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,059
that would plug in and a tape of

00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,440
physical day a magnetic tape and it

00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:25,900
would take five minutes to save your

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,579
five line program but we didn't have the

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,089
cable we didn't have a tape recorder so

00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:34,599
I would type in the same program turn

00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:36,039
the power off it's gone next you know

00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:36,759
it's so basically no persistence

00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,259
whatsoever

00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:43,329
oh and then and you know and finally you

00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:44,650
know over the years like you know my

00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:46,380
dad's like you sure do like this

00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:49,900
programming thing huh boy

00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:54,700
and my desk doesn't talk like that at

00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:57,160
all but but eventually you know I got

00:46:54,700 --> 00:47:00,190
into Java and all that and I wonder kind

00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,019
of you know I see kind of the horizon

00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:04,089
you know my ship has sailed

00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:07,150
I might be a full up functional

00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:09,609
programmer Navy but I've kind of you

00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:12,069
know might had my day and I kind of

00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:13,900
wonder like where were we leaving for

00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:15,849
the next generation right these are my

00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,989
girls this is after they saw the movie

00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:19,450
gravity I don't know if you remember

00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:21,460
that movie so they're they're playing

00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:23,739
they're how Holly is about to go into

00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,059
orbit Meredith's holding her back and

00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:28,170
Holly didn't dress up for this by the

00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:31,059
way this is just how Holly dresses so

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:33,460
but but you know the next generation of

00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:37,450
developer you know they you know my team

00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:39,729
and then after my team matures and and

00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:41,619
the the values that they instill are

00:47:39,729 --> 00:47:42,249
they getting still object-oriented you

00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:44,799
know like Java

00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:47,019
it's just what we got it's fine you deal

00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:48,640
with it or is it more of a you know

00:47:47,019 --> 00:47:50,410
there's a lot this functional

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,239
programming idea it's got legs there's a

00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:56,200
lot of elegance in this language the

00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:58,019
Scala so that's I guess the the final

00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,369
thought I would leave for you and I hope

00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:04,089
that it was a positive thought because

00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:06,849
now you have to rate it so try to think

00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:10,210
back on the session the most positive

00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:13,029
memory you have from it channel that and

00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:15,249
then reach for the rating so that's all

00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:17,410
I have thanks for listening I'm over

00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:19,900
time you could applaud now and then I

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,460
asked for questions all right I'll just

00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,859
ask for questions

00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:29,880
who's had questions this is it I'm done

00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:29,880
this is this is it yep yep yep

00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,420
for me personally or the team that I was

00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:40,690
talking about the team personally was

00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:43,480
about I would say eight months eight

00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:45,130
months ish and this was after a lot of

00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,290
false starts earlier when I said build

00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,059
the Scala team in five years that was a

00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,190
five-year journey for me personally to

00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,800
try to kind of Kindle or you know

00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:56,079
they're like ignite interest and we

00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,280
wrote some tools and people would modify

00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,890
them and they'd leave the company or

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,109
wouldn't do anything but this is the

00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,180
first time something stuck to actually

00:49:02,109 --> 00:49:05,890
go into production and for better or

00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,230
worse it lives in the world now and has

00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,240
to be maintained and modified and we

00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,220
still have active interest in it so

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:18,040
let's call it eight months over a

00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:20,069
five-year trial yeah yep yeah yeah so I

00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,420
should probably repeat the question but

00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:27,369
is there more momentum now that this

00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:30,790
thing is out absolutely yeah so it's you

00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:32,859
know the path is there my my management

00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,630
doesn't have to be sold on the

00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:36,280
scalloping anymore in fact it's more of

00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,829
a like oh yeah are you going to do this

00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,970
job or Scala do you think oh oh okay

00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:41,530
that's fine

00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:44,230
there's more momentum for actually

00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:48,579
hiring Scala developers because we have

00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:50,020
we can interview now and we don't have

00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:53,170
to take their word for it that they know

00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,119
what they're doing and it's really it's

00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:57,059
all about the culture and you know that

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,829
that team of five and hopefully growing

00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:01,690
people who are invested in it and if I

00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:02,319
leave the company or get you know just

00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:05,799
go my own way

00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:09,010
I I feel like that will continue and I

00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:12,160
feel like that's the key Maxim Thanks

00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,809
anyone else yep yeah yeah so yeah so the

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,710
question is are is there kind of more of

00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:19,240
a appetite for like the docker mesas

00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:24,150
kubernetes of the world over like the

00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:28,240
homegrown stuff sort of yeah yeah yeah

00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:30,640
reluctantly yeah I mean specific well

00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,460
specifically where I work I mean if you

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,109
go to conferences it's very clear like

00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,660
oh yeah everybody everyone

00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:39,549
using docker clearly I mean like it's

00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,869
very it seems like a very hot technology

00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:44,920
right now but yeah there is some tepid

00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,599
introduc introduction to it

00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,829
the thing is because I work for a

00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:49,960
financial exchange we're highly

00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:52,599
regulated especially in the deployment

00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,249
pipeline subject to audits you have to

00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:56,410
be really careful and you kind of need

00:50:54,249 --> 00:51:03,160
tight control over your your deployment

00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:06,160
pipeline but yeah any anyone else cool

00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:10,359
well thanks I really enjoyed I enjoyed

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:14,109
this like I says my first scala talk at

00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:15,849
it Scala conference and I I think I had

00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:18,730
a lot of fun I hope you had a good time

00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:21,740
listening to it as much as as I enjoyed

00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:27,610
writing and so so thanks

00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:27,610
