Abstract: 
Financial Exchanges are all about enabling near real-time market transactions with minimal latency and maximal predictability. In an environment where performance is king, and "zero garbage" and "lock-free" algorithms are the norm, come hear how one team decided to take a different approach using Scala.

This talk is part technical case study, part project postmortem, and part reflections on building a Scala team from the ground up. We'll talk about how Scala can succeed in a highly regulated, generally risk-averse environment, and why it can be worth that risk and lead to a happier, healthier team.

Still not sure if this talk will be worth your time? You might enjoy this talk if you believe in Life Beyond Java, but the rest of your team thinks that Java 8 Lambdas killed Scala and you are looking for moral support.
