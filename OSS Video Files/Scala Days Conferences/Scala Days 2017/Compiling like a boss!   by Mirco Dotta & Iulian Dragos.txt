Abstract: 
We all love Scala, but the one aspect we have a hard time accepting are long compile times. It’s not uncommon for a project to experience compilation times of a handful of minutes, if not worse. On top of that, compilation times are unpredictable, depending on a combination of language features, external libraries, and type annotations. A single line change may increase compilation times ten fold.
What can we do? It’s paramount we gain greater insight into the tools and libraries we use. There are also established (anti-)patterns that you should know about, if you fancy to keep compilation times to a minimum. And why not utilizing all cores when compiling? The stock Scala compiler can’t do it, but Triplequote Hydra is here to change that. Sit tight and let’s cut down on compilation time!
