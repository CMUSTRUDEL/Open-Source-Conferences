Abstract: 
Scala.js brought Scala to web frontend development, relieving developers from many of the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript. As library support for Scala.js keeps maturing, it is becoming a very solid environment for real full-stack web development.

In this talk, you will discover the practices of frontend development in Scala and the benefits it brings. You will also explore the intriguing future of true cross-platform frontend development with Scala.js, Scala for Android and Scala Native for iOS. Scala - the one language to rule them all!
