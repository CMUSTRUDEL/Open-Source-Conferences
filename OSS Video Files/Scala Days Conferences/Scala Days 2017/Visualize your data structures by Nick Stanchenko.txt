Abstract: 
Reftree is a Scala library for producing pretty diagrams and animations of data structures (http://stanch.github.io/reftree/demo). It can be used for documentation, live coding or as an interactive tool for understanding how stuff works.

This talk showcases Reftree and explores how functional programming techniques such as lenses and zippers can be used to implement visualizations of themselves.
