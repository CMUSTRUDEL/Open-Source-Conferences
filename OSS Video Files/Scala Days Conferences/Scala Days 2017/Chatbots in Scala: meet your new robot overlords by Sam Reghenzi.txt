Abstract: 
What are chatbots? Why are they such a big opportunity? How do they work? How can I build one? 
A chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, with whom you can interact with via a chat UI interface. It leads to interesting challenges for a software engineer: natural language processing, concurrency and conversational state management. Scala offers an amazing array of tools to engage these challenges. Let's do it!

welcome to this section to meet your new

00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:17,200
robotic overlords my name is Sam M I'm

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:20,680
here to introduce you your new robotic

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,860
overlords you don't know about the you

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,720
because you have been here for almost

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:32,739
two days locked in this place without

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,890
windows but the singularity happens the

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:38,920
robot has taken power the machine

00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:44,080
rebelled against the humans and now our

00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,600
overlords are the machine and I'm here

00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,510
to teach you how to relate with them

00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:55,300
with Scala which is our favorite

00:00:49,510 --> 00:01:00,280
language so let's start please use the

00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,649
study apps for rating this session rated

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,170
whatever you want the feedback is really

00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:08,140
appreciated both from the speaker the

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:12,300
organizer and the the future antennas

00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:16,840
which will have even better experience

00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,390
but remember that I work for the new

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,720
robotic overlords and they monitor all

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,080
the communication so both freely but

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,210
both wise I would like to tell you that

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,190
I come from the future to save you all

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:32,190
but it's not like that

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,430
Who am I I'm a software developer a

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,040
senior software developer as you can see

00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:49,960
from my great hair I am natural language

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,130
processing enthusiast I I studied a lot

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:56,920
in the past

00:01:51,130 --> 00:02:01,030
I made some research in it and keep

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:06,040
aside because I I developed a lot of

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:11,170
application in other fields then machine

00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:15,910
learning started to blossom so I start

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:20,280
learning also machine learning and for

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:23,739
my day to day job ah I always found

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,440
there are paths that they needed to be

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,690
automated boring repeating tasks that

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:34,290
being to be attorneys and I I have a bit

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:37,750
of a succession for for visit daily so I

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,910
wouldn't find myself as a DevOps but I

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:46,650
do a lot of continuous integration

00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,650
deployment and monitoring and spa and

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,360
doing this presentation you will learn

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,500
that I love those stories okay I love

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,730
the stories and I maybe diverge a bit

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:09,519
and now and then on all sites doors but

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:13,269
the the old dull purpose is to make it a

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,519
bit more entertaining because they have

00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:18,640
to make a bit of a disclaimer at the

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,840
beginning that in this presentation

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,910
there will be a not much cold I mean

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,750
it's not ahsoka

00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:32,140
as a scholar the language or the Scala

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:37,120
compiler how how to evolve it how to

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:40,299
improve it it's more tools like the ones

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:45,640
maybe you attended about architecture

00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:49,989
micro service and it's more about how to

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,380
implement a chatbot in scala and its

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:57,760
ecosystem and white collar is a good

00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:00,760
language to implement Chapman and no

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:07,440
humans has been heard in the preparation

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:11,650
of this dork so what is the chapel and

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,970
why should you care basically a chatbot

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:18,930
is a program that interact with the you

00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,209
moment through a chat

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,949
application it could be a web

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:28,530
application it could be a mobile

00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:32,940
application and you see the chapter as

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:36,570
that in the chat subsystem as a back-end

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:40,710
for your chart water which receive

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:46,080
inquiries and answers with the data and

00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:50,160
it started to ask to the developer it

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:54,509
sounds a produce stand forward I mean if

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:58,770
water our service does anyway but if you

00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:04,979
think as chat maybe you have radiates

00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:08,449
something for teens that stay on both

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:13,020
upper or net charter that send the

00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:17,810
unicorns and cats react at non

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:23,360
categorical but not it's not likely if

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:28,650
it's a huge market that is blossom and

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,949
you see there are a lot of of interest

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,710
in chat water because they can automatic

00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:38,010
alchemist stuff that other wiser you

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:41,669
need a specific interface to to complain

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:48,060
and these are notable example of chat

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:51,810
box for example there is a big use of

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,620
chat BOTS in travel agencies or

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,199
traveling website that use the chat

00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,389
water to interact with customers if you

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:07,180
think about it if you don't travel

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:12,100
really really really often having at the

00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:17,139
mobile application of this plane company

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:22,050
or that hotel and installed on your

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:24,070
device to check-in checkout sees the

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,490
plane is on schedule

00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:31,030
etc it's really tedious yet install a

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,550
lot of application you don't need an so

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,470
often in the consumer space you have to

00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:41,700
updated and it's a it's not the most

00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:48,010
enjoyable experience from from the user

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:51,430
so chatbot are the answer to replace

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:54,910
apps on your mobile that you don't use

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,110
very often for example one of the most

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:02,620
successful chat bots is called a poncho

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,470
which is a kind of raincoat you put on

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:10,030
on all your body and why is it

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:13,150
successful because the me feel the

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,880
weather / the weather forecast

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:20,620
application is application we all have

00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:25,030
on our phone but what if we are not in

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:27,850
our use location okay well it has to

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,919
access our GPS and find the forecast for

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:34,660
the specific location and what is we

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:37,000
have a special inquiries with poncho you

00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:41,460
don't have to install anything you can

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,090
have notification if weather changes and

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:49,630
you don't consume space on your device

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:52,870
so it has been told I have been told

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:58,000
that the chat one of the next apps in

00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:01,210
the next few years probably the the

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,460
mobile phones smartphones we will get

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:08,200
simple and most of the application one

00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:14,110
one sort of application will became chat

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:19,599
mod the chat application will improve

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,680
the user experience because you must

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,130
understand that

00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,880
but are really easy to implement at some

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:31,570
degree easier than mobile application in

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:36,729
which you have to study carefully the

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:42,750
user experience the UI they ever our

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:47,110
tremendous effort to in the release

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:51,430
because it has been downloaded also from

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:57,100
so many people and the chat bots are

00:08:51,430 --> 00:09:03,700
used usually http-based I mean in the

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:10,270
99% of the chat bot platforms Facebook

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:16,779
Messenger netjet telegram you just have

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:19,959
to register our book and send the HTTP

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:23,500
request to reply so it's a really really

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:29,160
simple modern model compared to the atom

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,160
system of the UI of our mobile phone

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:37,779
truth is that mobile application has a

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:41,470
very limited interface what I mean I

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:43,390
mean that either from a mobile

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:47,860
application you can activate the camera

00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:51,279
activate the GPS activated gyroscopes

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:55,510
and so on from a chat application you

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:59,650
only have access to the device that the

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:04,420
chat application itself gives you so at

00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:10,209
the time speaking with a chat bot you

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:15,040
can receive and send images and audio

00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:19,930
and the summer application or also the

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,870
the position so you can localize the the

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:28,810
user but that's it you don't have access

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:29,440
or any sophisticated metering on the

00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,290
device

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,760
so the and also you can interact with

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,500
other application

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:42,209
if you use a music application you want

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:45,970
to use it when you are running with your

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:54,339
training up with regular apps you can do

00:10:45,970 --> 00:11:00,250
it with the chat bot not so how a person

00:10:54,339 --> 00:11:03,160
like me who is a developer and a natural

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:08,970
language enthusiast the arrived at

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:12,490
Chapman but I started a lot of time ago

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,490
when I was still in the university and

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:22,829
there was no lag or no messenger no

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:26,829
Facebook there was a lot of IRC okay

00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:30,160
which is a chatting protocol with the

00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:35,880
different servers and I started the

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:40,000
writing bought from IRC and it is a

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:45,250
widely used till today and both are used

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:50,639
on a is a channel to gather information

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:55,180
about the user and log the chat and

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:59,050
serve a file from from other sources

00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:05,290
because IRC has still really really

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:11,290
really performant the system to send Phi

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:15,459
to the user and to N so I write the IRC

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:20,550
chat bhatta who behaves like a pirate or

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:24,610
a movie Charter but they are they were

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:29,139
just a sequence of condition that they

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:34,029
Ethernet reply in some way and so at the

00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:38,500
end of my university career I started to

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:43,930
study natural language processing in the

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,430
eye I try to make something that

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,010
understand what was written

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:53,250
written texture and something this from

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:56,220
the purpose of summarization when I

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:59,760
started the working it on realice oft

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:05,100
where I also discovered that I hate the

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:09,930
UI design and I'm not very good at that

00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:13,170
and so when I heard about chat bots I

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:16,470
thought to myself oh well no more UI

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:19,380
designer no more JavaScript I'm I'm very

00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:25,160
happy of these Chappell things let's do

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:30,260
it them so if I start reading around and

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:40,470
come up with these this book that was a

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:43,980
part of my DevOps sorta jobs and well I

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:50,550
started looking at the chat bot as an

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:55,140
option to automate stuff okay obviously

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:58,980
we have in my working group we have our

00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:04,410
group chat to her messages and we were

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:07,650
really annoyed by the enormous amount of

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:11,010
email we received for the continuous

00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:17,060
integration server so this is one of my

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:19,230
story so we switched and integrated the

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,770
continuous integration server the

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:26,850
messages with the chart so instead of

00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:30,390
receiving just the build is broken or

00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:33,660
the build is okay and we receive a

00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:38,940
message on the top on the chat channel

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:42,120
sorry long story short we started to

00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,930
appreciate it to other more and more

00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,529
messages for example if a build was our

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:51,470
distribution builder and

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:54,649
Jonah was available so different

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,889
channels were broadcasted and more

00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:01,749
informative messages which we would hate

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:04,850
really hated whether in our mailbox and

00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:07,550
that's what it increases collaboration

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:12,379
and it increases the main knowledge oh

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:15,439
did you ship version 1.0.0 if you are on

00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:18,439
the channel you know it and visibility

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:24,350
and awareness of what what was going on

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:29,329
and also including speed of execution I

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:33,949
mean if if you push something that broke

00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:38,269
the Builder you receive the message on

00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:42,370
the a.m. and on the on the channel and

00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,519
it's even faster than receiving email or

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:50,540
opener

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:54,290
we we don't check email so so and also

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:57,199
we have the automatic logging of the

00:15:54,290 --> 00:16:01,579
conversation so we can replay a

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,970
conversation even if nothing connected

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:09,470
with the channel so a big reduction of

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:13,220
email so I started to think what we we

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,069
can talk back to the to the server okay

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:20,269
and so I'm playing with a chart bottle

00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:24,559
that can understand comment and instead

00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:28,759
of connecting to the console of the

00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:31,699
continuous integration server I can run

00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:34,309
built from from the chart the chart was

00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:38,449
already there I don't have to setup a

00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:40,790
new browser open the console see mean go

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:43,370
to the specific project I want to build

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:48,559
them and running and waited for the bill

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:52,480
to to be completed if it turns out it

00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:56,490
was really really really handy and and

00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,490
it also improves the

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:03,580
the rate of interaction because you

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,100
don't have to wait for the UI you don't

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,650
have you don't have to wait for the

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,380
logging because out indication

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:16,090
authorization are already in place

00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:21,340
between the server and the chata and the

00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:25,300
chat network and it's a human rate

00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:28,870
synchronous communication and the

00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:32,860
problem interacting with the software

00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:35,860
especially remote software is that order

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,880
to slow okay you wait forever for the

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:45,220
page to load only to fast imagine a

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:50,500
human managing message queue it's a it's

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:56,230
impossible in this way you have a human

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:59,800
rate synchronous communication so we go

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,830
to the point for ask Alan okay why not

00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,070
using a toolkit

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:11,020
what's our toolkit are there are a lot

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:14,890
of tools that from eyes design your own

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:20,440
chat BOTS without coding and these tools

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:23,290
are basically designers that the design

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,870
Theresa so if the user ask Adisa

00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:30,640
answered that and you can design it in a

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:34,620
fancy graphical way and well what you

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,620
get are very

00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:42,330
poor design frequently asked the

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:46,509
question because that that was it is and

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:50,169
we do this kind of of instrument you

00:18:46,509 --> 00:18:53,169
can't integrate with other system

00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:57,850
because they are not designed to we can

00:18:53,169 --> 00:19:04,059
you can embed complex logic if I receive

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:10,590
this message I ever to activate robotic

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:15,249
armor in some factory in China so at

00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:19,570
some degree up after now at least you

00:19:15,249 --> 00:19:22,749
still need the coding to to build chat

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:27,609
water that are designed for specific

00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:30,669
purposes but again why scallop well got

00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:35,499
ran sponsor because it's my favorite

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:38,820
language but if you think about it Scala

00:19:35,499 --> 00:19:43,869
could be a really bad choice for

00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:46,179
implementing a chat mode because it it's

00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:51,070
a functional program okay it's object

00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:54,749
oriented but also functional language so

00:19:51,070 --> 00:20:00,519
you shoot the writing functional style

00:19:54,749 --> 00:20:04,840
but functional style you shouldn't keep

00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:07,749
state okay and the conversation if you

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:13,869
think about it it's it's all about state

00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:16,480
I have a question you answer me and this

00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:19,179
is what the conversation is and we have

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,970
to go further and further and further

00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:27,960
but if you lost the state of the

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:31,629
conversation we have to start it all so

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:36,429
the point of using Scala is a multi to

00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:39,850
build a so-called expert system sequence

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:43,510
of if if the question is this then this

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:46,779
that and net really really nested

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:49,120
sequence of conviction of cases after

00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:53,740
matching a user world whatever concert

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:58,630
you want but you can get very very deep

00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:01,269
in the rabbit hole you can get something

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:07,389
that is really really hard to maintain

00:21:01,269 --> 00:21:13,630
so what how we can handle it in Scala

00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:19,450
what with the Monell or at least with a

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:23,440
monadic structure in Haskell for example

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:26,460
the there is a so called IO monad so

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:32,639
everything that has a state is a hidden

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:35,799
within a model and if you if you have a

00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:38,830
mutable structure which is at the

00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:44,350
conversation state you can use a monitor

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:47,440
to model the conversation and you you

00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,419
don't have to keep track of what the

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,230
conversation is but just when you have

00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:58,929
another iteration the conversation pop

00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:01,059
up naturally so this is an example of a

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:03,690
generic model you have the poor function

00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:06,639
and the flat map function everybody

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:12,909
comfortable with the concept of monitor

00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:15,760
should I spend the couple of hormone so

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:20,049
this is the classic model if you

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:25,570
declining in the chat bot perspective we

00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:30,820
can ever the chat pod as a Moana boxing

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:33,309
a conversation okay a few function which

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,240
is the starting point okay where my

00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:41,080
conversation start how do I engage my my

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,639
user and what is returned in to turn the

00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,299
context of the conversation

00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:50,710
okay the starting point and with the

00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:55,870
flat map I have the questions and the

00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:56,880
answer for just the sake of modeling des

00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,900
I assumed

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,450
the user always have a question sir and

00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,070
the chat waters always answer but it

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:10,230
could be also the way around and from

00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,470
the context okay

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:18,420
of the question that that has been made

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:22,860
I can find the function okay that put

00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,960
the answer in context if you if you look

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,540
at this example the C is the

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,050
conversation the Q is the question and

00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:35,370
the a is the answer and everything fit

00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:38,520
together quite nicely I'm trying to bend

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:43,860
at the moment of the melodic concept to

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,950
the chat when I found out it it fits

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,590
very well because when I started coding

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:53,070
my first term complex chat water

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:55,440
I checked the decoder just yesterday

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,830
evening and before preparing this

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,440
presentation and I was horrified okay I

00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:05,210
check out the version zero of the git

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:09,000
repository and it was a huge huge

00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:13,170
sequence of cases cases nine cases these

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,150
fail and it was just bad scale code okay

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:19,200
well you can write bad code in ever

00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:23,850
because I was eager to see how it was

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:27,030
but when I take take a step back and try

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:30,810
to well let's use some data structure

00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:33,480
let's use Scala not just as a general

00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:38,190
guide language but for what it is well

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:43,530
this concept of monadic sat water came

00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:47,430
out and this is good because if we

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:51,990
compare to an infinite sequence of cases

00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:56,160
and it's it lets you to do conversation

00:24:51,990 --> 00:25:02,040
design okay in conversation designer is

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:05,310
the new UX design because it you have to

00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:09,080
keep the user in the loop okay and you

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:14,510
don't have to try to outsmart the user

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:18,510
to trick them to think if it wasn't

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:22,020
aborted at least speaking to okay and so

00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,000
if the body doesn't understand what what

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,000
the user is saying or what he wanted you

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:33,750
have to state it clearly and make the

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:39,840
context clean and the whole and avoided

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:46,290
to made our messy code base it happens

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:48,900
to me that a few weeks ago I had to

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,150
schedule a meeting with the with a

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:57,540
person with a manager of another company

00:25:51,150 --> 00:26:00,540
and we were writing emails and at some

00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:03,360
point they said hey Tony

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,780
can you please a schedule a meeting with

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,650
Sam and I have seat another email from

00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:14,700
Tony and say hi I have to schedule a

00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:18,270
meeting for you and my god it's okay for

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,700
Friday evening I know it's not okay

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:25,380
I reply no it's not okay for me I would

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:28,680
prefer on Monday plancha and and say

00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,090
okay Amanda at lunch perfect done and I

00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,520
reply oh thank you Tony

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:36,570
you're very kind nice to meet you and

00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:40,260
then Tony replied me I'm sorry I didn't

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:44,010
understand my master didn't teach me how

00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,180
to respond to to your own query so I for

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,440
two emails

00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:52,980
Tony passes the Turing test okay it took

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,890
me three method to to find out it was it

00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,770
wasn't a real person but it was a it was

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:01,640
about I was really really astonished at

00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,930
it and it increased my interest for

00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:11,720
chatbots

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:16,560
explanation so how we fit the

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,810
conversation model with appliqué with

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:26,640
duplicative model of our melodic

00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:29,970
well if you think in terms of trees

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:36,100
okay you start at some point and you

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:40,600
like the conversation diverge but in my

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:43,750
opinion and my experience tree is a

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,780
simplification if you think about the

00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:50,080
conversation if you are especially at

00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:54,040
events like this one at Scala days in

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:57,490
the hallways or with the coffee you

00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:03,760
always jump subject okay you don't ever

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:09,400
a specific meal options through to

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:13,210
the conversation so rats are the most

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:16,390
usable the most useful and data

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:18,970
structure for modeling are the

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:24,880
conversation of a child and you see if

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:28,630
you think about it then the single node

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,680
is could model the answer and then every

00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:35,800
branch of the of the graph the arc of

00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:39,580
the browser of the graph could be the

00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:44,440
function of the flat map per object you

00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:48,210
had the context which is the branch you

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:52,510
have arrived to and the function is the

00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:58,300
the arc that connects to a node which

00:28:52,510 --> 00:29:03,850
are the question and the answer I was a

00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:06,010
little scared of using using graph data

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,100
structure because I didn't know that

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,880
much study started I started study them

00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:15,910
sorry

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:20,040
and it happens quite the party singular

00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:25,530
situation this year in which our

00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:30,139
researcher named Laszlo Bob I discovered

00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:34,279
made a huge discover in in graph

00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:37,429
Groff science that you can apply is a

00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:42,379
morphism in quasi-polynomial time which

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:45,499
is a big word to see to say that you can

00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:49,450
travel between nodes as a define the

00:29:45,499 --> 00:29:56,509
nodes faster than you were supposed to

00:29:49,450 --> 00:30:00,529
and visa this discovery has a true world

00:29:56,509 --> 00:30:02,839
record it was the discovery that that

00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:06,700
has been avoided in the last time

00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:10,549
because the after the public faces paper

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:13,099
another person found an error in losing

00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:17,289
his work assaulted it was no not longer

00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:20,899
valid and a week after last lullaby

00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:26,059
found the error corrected and proved it

00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:29,869
again that the graphs are isomorphic in

00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:31,969
quasi-polynomial time so it you don't

00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:36,559
have to worry about performance in a

00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:39,469
data structure complex as a graph most

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,940
of the graph database because at the end

00:30:39,469 --> 00:30:43,940
you have to persist that your

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,690
conversation structure somewhere are

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:51,440
implemented on the JVM new for j1 for

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:56,779
all and have a great great support from

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,299
Scala with specific DSL and so Scala is

00:30:56,779 --> 00:31:03,200
a great tool to the other with graph

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:05,979
database speaking of which what

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,059
architecture is needed for the

00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:13,419
developing channel so I thought to look

00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:18,499
around and basically as you can imagine

00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:21,229
it's a message driven architecture an

00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:24,139
architecture that send messages receive

00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:30,169
messages and send it in it's all network

00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:33,200
to to do the adapter thing so you can

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:39,320
think about akka you can think about

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,490
other messaging system the point here is

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,270
to go

00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:48,590
what synchronous as soon as you can

00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:51,050
since it is all the communication

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:56,330
between the chat back-end and the chat

00:31:51,050 --> 00:32:01,720
bot is a HTTP base all the web framework

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:12,070
so technology applied so play HTTP for s

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:15,800
RK HTTP or valid valid material so

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:22,400
messaging is a really really good on

00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:25,630
Scala and so Scala is good for table I

00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,040
don't have to say that a lot of

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:32,360
messaging infrastructure nowadays are

00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:36,860
built in Scala faster processing and if

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,679
your user base scale after you you have

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,690
to and yet you have to implement some

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,020
some level of a synchronous

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:50,110
communication to not get struct and a

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:54,429
lot of chat providers such as like

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:57,740
benchmark you okay same you paid traffic

00:32:54,429 --> 00:32:59,950
not lacking particularly but send you

00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,080
fake traffic to death if your

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:09,559
architecture is good enough to scale to

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:12,860
a lot of users but how can I understand

00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:16,370
what the user is telling because in

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,809
traditional UI you have buttons you have

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:23,480
a text box and it's very simple to bound

00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:26,990
the what the user the user input to your

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,710
domain object how do you could you do in

00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:32,900
with the with the chat bot well you have

00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:36,080
to use what we call the natural language

00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,140
possession that I image earlier someone

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,409
is familiar with

00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:48,190
language processing okay just a few and

00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:51,159
basically you have to make the computer

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:53,679
read and understand what what you are

00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:58,149
seeing in your natural language nothing

00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:02,130
on a programming language and as I say

00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:05,769
the two one to my students when I do

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:08,320
programming 101 courses we are meant to

00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:11,109
program the computer and not the way

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,949
around when I see they Street to

00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:16,500
understand the programming language and

00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,659
[Music]

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,879
how natural language processing words

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:27,310
but there are different approaches the

00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:29,349
basic one is the pattern matching so you

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:32,470
are familiar with the concept of other

00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:37,359
matching from Scala is basically the

00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:40,060
same thing and but it turns out that

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:43,720
it's really really difficult to analyze

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:47,520
a language structure as as a human

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:52,270
language with utter match you have to

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,760
put some syntactically analysis the same

00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:58,930
that ever have been teach you in

00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:04,320
elementary school but it means that you

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:08,320
have to separate the part of speech

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,950
relevant to understand what that and the

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:16,210
phrases mean and the step forward is a

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:21,040
semantic grammar it means that you you

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:24,790
put older than the tokens in context and

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,330
this is the step that lets you

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:31,650
understand there is a a new a new

00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:34,510
approach a which is a case frame

00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:37,780
instantiation which I'm not really

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:43,120
really familiar with that but it's a

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:48,040
really promising the problem is that in

00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:55,300
this way you can only understand phrases

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:58,570
that you already know you you can't you

00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:03,370
never know how what the user will come

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:05,560
up with if they say something that you

00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:07,420
are able to analyze it it's okay

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,350
otherwise your bottom will not

00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:15,700
understand how to split the simple water

00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:19,560
to split the percentage so the natural

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:24,790
language processing is now using also

00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,560
machine learning approach and how many

00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:31,420
of you are familiar with machine

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:36,160
learning terminology good good we can go

00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:39,610
faster on their own networks and the the

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,630
point is that the natural language

00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:50,620
processing is used to analyze the speech

00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:53,800
and to make the training set for machine

00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:57,520
learning okay if you think you can start

00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,280
if you have to make a sub water that is

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,340
the equivalent of a phone operator of a

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:07,330
telco company you can start from a log

00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:11,500
of the real operators chatting with the

00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:14,700
user with the phone transcription if you

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:20,860
are building a chat water that is

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:23,290
related to movie you can use a movie

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:27,610
transcript and dialogues and to train

00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,950
the data and maybe you use turnout with

00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:37,360
someone that speaks a like Gandalf from

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:39,309
The Lord of the Rings when you when you

00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,199
start

00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:44,989
to use machine learning you have to

00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:47,599
choose a classification model so the

00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:51,949
usually the pacification model or chosen

00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:55,459
for developing natural language

00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:58,880
processing is the network and net

00:37:55,459 --> 00:38:01,849
natural networks more Prasad more

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,900
precisely a feed-forward network neural

00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:09,469
networks it's the brain of our childhood

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:12,079
and if that makes him understand what we

00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:19,009
are saying feed-forward neural networks

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:24,249
are stuff like this and input must be of

00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:28,039
a fixed size so we use a NL NPA and

00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:34,579
natural language processing to tokenize

00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:36,859
our our taxes and transform them in an

00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:40,359
input digestible by the network neural

00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,569
networks and this is the encoded data

00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:44,719
okay

00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:47,689
we needed that encoded data the decoded

00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:50,719
data basically thinks about encoded data

00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:52,309
as questions and decoded data as an

00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,489
answer with this question

00:38:52,309 --> 00:38:59,179
I expected this answer with a larger

00:38:55,489 --> 00:39:02,349
enough data set and we can build our so

00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:07,219
called the sequence to sequence model so

00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:11,359
it is a recurrent network with an

00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:15,229
encoder able to read the then coded data

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:22,189
and that decoder able to read decode

00:39:15,229 --> 00:39:25,489
data each of one is a sort of sub

00:39:22,189 --> 00:39:29,989
network of what is called the long short

00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:33,919
tempered long short-term memory and in

00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:37,969
neural so each of these balloons you see

00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:39,919
here is a step in the network that

00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:44,809
trains to the model and you see you have

00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:47,240
only one outcome and maybe you will say

00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:50,359
well then how can I do this

00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:54,050
in scala well it's better to start with

00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:57,430
something that is already in place such

00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:01,430
as spark that is building Scala and

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:05,420
specifically the machine learning subset

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:09,050
or spark or an alternative because

00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,859
therefore this kind of works is better

00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:16,270
to have the deep learning rather than

00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:20,450
machine learning it's quite simple to

00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:22,970
use you have thinking it has been done

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:26,030
in Scala us a Scala

00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:28,670
API really used to it really easy to use

00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:30,440
the only painful factor here are the

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,990
question function and the answer

00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,820
function that has to be model against

00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:39,800
your model and it's a bit complicated a

00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:42,339
training part the training part is a bit

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,730
tricky and in the machine learning

00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:48,589
Sparkle subsystem the directives is the

00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:51,650
giant thing in deep learning which is

00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:54,530
from Google is tensorflow the problem is

00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:58,220
that you don't you can't use a scholar

00:40:54,530 --> 00:41:00,830
to train it is the C++ and Python so you

00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,680
have to train it with Python and the

00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:09,109
Scala interface that I found most useful

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:12,339
is in GE RPC so basically you have an

00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:16,160
external service that provides you the

00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:18,050
natural language process so they analyze

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,099
the message and let you understand them

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:23,750
so why don't

00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:29,530
external eyes everything okay

00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:33,950
NLP and as a service there are a lot of

00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:37,609
service user in the cloud that does this

00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:40,010
stuff the danger here is become too

00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:48,080
dependent from an external services

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:52,339
personally I have user a API ie which is

00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:54,800
owned by Google I think and which is

00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:57,420
which is a service that you call you

00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,420
send a request with the

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:06,600
with a profit message and it turns out

00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:09,750
our a commander or our reaction and you

00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:13,200
can easily train the model on the on the

00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:15,210
system sending just a raw data and it

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,120
trains the models and that gives you

00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:20,790
answer these answer the the common valor

00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:26,070
you see on there is exactly what you

00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:28,320
need to choose what what branch of your

00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,450
graph choose at that time of the

00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:37,590
conversation to put everything in

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:40,260
context and this is disease it I mean if

00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,060
I told you about natural language

00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,180
processing at all you about machine

00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:49,850
learning because there are stuff you

00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:53,220
have to know when when you approach a

00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:57,690
chat most development and because

00:42:53,220 --> 00:43:01,790
otherwise you don't really get what you

00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:04,250
are going and if you once you have a

00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:08,360
with a bit of familiarity of

00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:11,820
interpretation the only tricky part is

00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:16,230
testing testing chat BOTS it's quite

00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:19,110
hard because you relay on an external

00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:23,250
service to deliver the the data to the

00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:30,320
user and to to get them so my advice

00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:33,990
here is to mock everything okay both the

00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:36,200
both sides from the chat bot net so from

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:40,340
the chat network to your internal

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:43,980
applicate application network and and

00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:47,040
and they use the golden master approach

00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:51,120
so I receive the distaff from the chat

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:55,410
bot chat networker and so I take it from

00:43:51,120 --> 00:44:02,030
for a good for good inquiry and use it

00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:06,060
as a test case and do it a lot and they

00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:09,440
updated with the specification of your

00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:15,620
provider because it happens all the time

00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:17,930
API changes and you you stay behind so

00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,590
where you can go from here

00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:26,870
and you can develop your own chat bot

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:29,560
you have all the basic bricks and you

00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:34,780
can build a web application with the

00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:37,820
that inquiry and get queried by the

00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,390
charter network and if you have a

00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:44,570
question I'm a here round I am gone a

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:48,380
bit longer so this is at the reference

00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:50,480
user of what what I quoted here and

00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:55,100
there the beautiful images are taken

00:44:50,480 --> 00:45:00,360
from this website and splash and the

00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:07,559
stock map and the top

00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:07,559
[Applause]

00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:22,470
I have one more story if you are

00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:25,380
interested when now I have heard the

00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:28,740
people speaking of speaking chat would

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:34,610
like Amazon has his own Google as his

00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:38,130
own and when I think about speaking with

00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:41,250
with computers and voice recognition are

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:46,410
very good example but also very bad

00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:48,750
example and there was a c5 movie from

00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:53,160
with people coming from the future and

00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:55,440
in the past in our days and one of them

00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:59,010
were computer scientists from the future

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,190
so he approached a computer and started

00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:06,360
to speak with it computer these are

00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:09,330
these and that and under so the shop

00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,070
assistant give him the mouse so if you

00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:14,730
take the mouse and started speaking in

00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:17,580
the mouse computer these days than that

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,800
and so the shop assistant show him the

00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,760
keyboard so you look at the shop

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,359
assistants i/o

00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,930
the keyboard how romantic that because

00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:30,450
it sounds like a thing of the past but I

00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:35,720
personally don't believe it is it and

00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:39,480
the because without the interaction of

00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:43,830
visual interaction we are not quite

00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:48,390
there okay we we have to have a fallback

00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:50,369
policy and there is a video I would like

00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:55,200
to show you but I couldn't

00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:58,730
since it goes against the code of

00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:02,250
conduit of this conference and you can

00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:05,250
search it in in the Internet and it's

00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:06,119
called the Scottish voice-activated

00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,560
elevator

00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:13,280
basically there is a elevator activated

00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,990
with voice and

00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:22,220
there are two Scottish people in there I

00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:25,260
don't want to yeah and I love Anna and

00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:28,349
basically the elevator can't understand

00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:32,250
their accent okay and so they are struck

00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:34,230
and they get very angry and it's a real

00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,240
fun level of it

00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:42,410
thank you thank you

00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:42,410
