Abstract: 
Your project's code base is rock solid, you are rolling releases early and often, your test suite is comprehensive and running regularly, your code is well performing without any glitches. Everything is in place that defines a successful open source project - or isn't it?

This talk tries to highlight some of the key questions software developers will quickly be faced with when dealing with open source: In addition to coding skills, topics like people management, naming, trademark enforcement, licensing, patents, pr and more become topics to deal with.
After years of using open source projects, running my own projects, founding meetups and conferences, watching others thrive or fail I believe that coding skills alone aren't sufficient to turn a "private play ground code base" into an open source project that other's can rely on.

Inspired by 140 characters of truth published here (https://twitter.com/janl/status/712593518015987712) the talk will focus on what topics that are usually not taught as part of programming courses will cross your way when dealing with open source - either as a user or as a contributor:
* People: Is the project willing and able to attract more contributors? Is it able to survive if the leader looses interest or time to continue contributing? How does the project deal with requests coming from the user base? How easy is it for users to get their issues fixed?
* Trademarks: Why should you care about trademarks from the beginning? How do you deal with others infringing on your trademarks?
* Copyright: Why should you care, exactly which license you choose?
* PR: While writing release notes is common practice and composing changelogs is pretty easy, the resulting documents are hard to grok for editors and won't get you on the front page of any magazine. Nor will they help you get visibility on common social media systems that might be key in informing your users about recent releases.
While being excellent at all topics isn't vital from the start, answers to governance questions decide what a project looks like a few years from it's start.

[Applause]

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,120
[Music]

00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:15,269
morning everyone first of all thanks for

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,310
waking up so early for my keynote so why

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,210
am I going to tell you something about

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,279
open source and why it's not just about

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,910
the source code first of all I'm a

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,119
software engineer by heart since a

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,899
couple of weeks right now I'm a open

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,130
source strategist at your pace I'm also

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,050
a member of the Apache Software

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,309
Foundation co-founder of Apache mahute

00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:45,210
raise your arm if you've heard about my

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:47,940
boot by any chip oh my gosh it's quite

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,940
few more than I expected and I'm

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,010
co-founder of Berlin buzzwords so if you

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,430
need an excuse to go to your employer

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,280
and have some pay for a ticket to Berlin

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,809
in June hinting Berlin in June was

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,870
really really nice and warm and sunny

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,140
and if you're interested in big data

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:11,430
stuff or search then you should check

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,729
out the website now you know a little

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,470
bit about myself I would like to know a

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,810
little bit about you as well how many of

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,430
you are running their own open source

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:25,490
projects github projects count a couple

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,990
okay

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,479
how many of you have contributed to any

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:37,860
open source projects keep your hands up

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:39,900
if this is Scala okay good how many of

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:46,320
you wrote about an open source projects

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:52,470
a blog post press articles tweets no

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:57,810
Twitter users seriously how many of you

00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:00,270
have helped people okay so why should

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,509
you care about what open source is about

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,159
other than source code after all we are

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,990
software engineers we take the library

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,259
we put it in our project and everything

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,680
works and everything is fine right okay

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:19,710
let me tell you a story

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I put my mom onto Ubuntu when they had

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,960
their first UI I was very frustrated to

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,550
learn that when they rolled out unity

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,440
the whole user experience changed

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,720
completely so if you teach other people

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,300
to use the project you probably want to

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,970
be in the loop of what their plans with

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,690
respect to new releases are so that you

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:47,550
have like a warning time to train your

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,810
users to do something else of course if

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,940
you're betting your business on an

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,160
open-source project you want to know how

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,960
this projects Discoverer and you want to

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,050
know what the likelihood is of this

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,480
project falling on the floor if the main

00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,120
contributor or maintainer loses interest

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,920
in this project if you're betting your

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,500
business on this project you probably

00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,020
also want to know what their approach to

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,970
fixing security issues looks like is it

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,860
very likely that security issues are

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,320
being leaked out before they are fixed

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,610
or is it more likely that they are fixed

00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,410
before they are published

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:24,710
and speaking of fixing those issues what

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:31,350
is the time it takes for this project or

00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:33,270
reactor security advisories that's not

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,360
not a lot least if you're running your

00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,560
own open source project and if you

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,200
wanted to become a little bit more

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,210
successful than just being a coder up

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,660
somewhere you will want to know about

00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,750
things like how do I get people into my

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,120
project how do I deal with people who

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,670
are stealing that time from the project

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,790
without adding value you probably want

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,970
to know about how how to manage tasks

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,620
and issues etc plus you probably want to

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:06,690
know about how to project your youth

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:09,210
downstream users from legal threats okay

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,830
let me start when you're building an

00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,310
open-source project what you want to do

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:16,770
is to first sit down and we'd think

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,989
about what your goal is do you want to

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:22,890
do this just to build your CV or your

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:25,070
reputation another goal could be to go

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,750
out and break into an existing market

00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,370
when by

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,250
providing source codes that otherwise

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:34,970
would be paid and proprietary under a

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,860
free software license or you could go as

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,080
a middle path where you want to

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,490
collaborate with a lot of other people

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,140
to build something that's bigger than

00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,970
anything that you could have built on

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,100
your own

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:50,210
depending on your fiancee or to these

00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:53,360
questions the stuff that you want to do

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:57,560
in addition to just coding will be

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,590
slightly different one questions that

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,990
will arise fairly early is whether you

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,720
want to be a benevolent dictator for for

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,300
our life that is whether you want total

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,040
control over the future of your project

00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:16,700
as you want to be able to dictate

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:19,100
project directions and whether whether

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,169
you want to build your company and bet

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,860
your company on top of this project

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:27,200
because most likely if this is your core

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,890
value you want to be able to trace the

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,770
direction without distraction however if

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,570
you decide to go for building a

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,270
dictatorship like that the question now

00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,300
arises is what happens to the dictator

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,700
goes away what happens if this one

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,680
single person loses interest what

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,130
happens if this company is being

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,360
acquired and business direction business

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,620
moves into a completely different

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:56,240
direction another approach that projects

00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,530
at the Apache Software Foundation take

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,690
is to have a more collaborative

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,840
environment where equal peers are

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,760
working towards a common goal and where

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,450
decisions are make made in a

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,790
consensus-based way the disadvantage of

00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,190
this except oftentimes with leads to

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,260
slower decisions because first you have

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,720
to get everyone on board or you have to

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,850
get a majority at least on board see

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,930
advantages that the project survives

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:28,550
people leaving for full disclaimer I

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,930
asked people before whether they know

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,970
about Apache Mahmood

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,610
I have to admit that for the past three

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,530
years I didn't have a lot of time to

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,870
spend on this project there's a tiny

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,920
little girl sitting over there I do have

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,920
a day job

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,900
I started doing a conference a couple

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,480
years ago all of this

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:52,070
cut away on my time for patchy mahute

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:56,090
nevertheless they put out a successful

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,310
release months after month and they put

00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:02,630
the project on a completely different

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:07,280
path than when I left so it continued to

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:10,640
survive it continued to live okay when

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,560
thinking about projects which what kind

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,930
of stuff do what kind of top topics do

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,510
you have to think about let's start with

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,830
the easy one copyright patent law

00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,450
trademarks patent law is sort of

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:26,450
relevant in Europe it's pretty relevant

00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:33,410
in the u.s. at least let's address

00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:35,870
copyright let's imagine you want to

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,450
build something and you want to give

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,340
those four freedoms of you study share

00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,460
improve not only to your downstream

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,340
users but to everyone using software

00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:50,420
that is derived from your project

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:52,610
obvious choice you go for copyleft if

00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,350
you have libraries that people want to

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,520
link to

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,420
probably more obvious to go for

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,830
something like LGPL if you go for server

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,510
software and you want to guarantee the

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:08,380
same freedoms you probably want to go

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:12,080
for a GPL GPL simply for everything else

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,580
okay now I'm up here too and my project

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,040
is licensed under the apache software

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:20,540
license why didn't I go to this site if

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,700
all you want to do is to ensure that

00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,520
your diet downstream users have the full

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,780
freedoms of you study share and proof

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,890
you probably want to go for an on

00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:33,020
copyleft license if it's small enough so

00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,820
you don't care just put it in public

00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,190
domain if it's like a shell script that

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,630
you wrote or some tiny little tooling

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,970
just put it out there with libraries

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,670
that implement the standards that you

00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:49,820
want to push for it makes sense to use

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,330
something that doesn't have a copyleft

00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,640
license so it's being

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:58,350
adopted by as many people as you can

00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:01,260
reach same is true for projects that

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,380
want to change existing economics or if

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:07,680
your goal is to have a very big

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,750
community where also corporate users

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,839
have no trouble with using this project

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,339
and the last point is why I went and

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,579
choose the Apache Software Foundation

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:20,250
the Apaches are licensed for Apache

00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:23,190
mahute the goal was to build a project

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:28,910
that would have the widest use case as

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,910
possible including corporate use cases

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,589
you probably want to think about and

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,810
read up on patent law I'm not going to

00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:40,050
go down there for me that's just

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:42,300
directing territory this people at the

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:49,380
fsfe who can educate you people at the

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:50,790
ffiii and other institutions you

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,500
probably also want to think about

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:57,660
trademark law again something boring to

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,140
speed something why do you want to think

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,300
about this well you don't want to

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,910
infringe patent names when you choose

00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,910
your project name you don't want to

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,970
spend months and years development time

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,490
only to be sued afterwards by income by

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,220
a company that owns the trademark of

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,110
your project what's even worse is you

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,209
don't want to have another project come

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,720
up to you and tell you hey this was our

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,089
our trademark to begin this it's just

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,160
embarrassing

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:32,220
there's a little anecdote you probably

00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:36,839
have heard about Apache Hadoop it's been

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:40,020
founded by that cutting the cutting once

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,990
told us that kids are very good at

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,990
coming up with non trademark name so

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:49,709
Hadoop actually is the name of a little

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:52,290
toy elephant there's also a search

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:55,440
engine that not the cutting roat which

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:59,329
is called nach not was the first sort of

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,980
words that one of his children invented

00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:06,020
so if you do have children maybe make

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,020
notes to find non trademark names

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,850
okay now you've got a non-infringing

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:17,640
name what's next you will have to decide

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:22,160
which uses of your name you have your

00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:25,380
proof for instance up here do you want

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:28,950
people to be able to sell copies of your

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:31,830
software via eBay under that name maybe

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:36,420
even including malware including viruses

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:41,089
whatever just a little anecdote about

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:46,970
genome logo down here original logo

00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:51,089
there is a little company which is

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:53,850
taking care of feet see that's a fish

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:56,970
pedicure company that is pretty much the

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,339
same logo except that there is a fish so

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:01,500
the genome people were faced with the

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:08,610
decision is this infringing OS is not

00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:10,320
infringing apparently it's not since the

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,790
question of whether whether or not you

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,760
want to register your trademark name

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,920
registering does cost money it costs

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,430
money in each country where you do this

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:25,770
registration it makes enforcing your

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:28,260
trademark just easier so what's the

00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:31,200
process of keeping your your trademark

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:34,380
current you find projects that or you

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,120
find usages of your project name you

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,830
ident you have then have to go through a

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,770
process where you identify whether this

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:43,440
usage is infringing or not and then you

00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,700
have to actively fight infringement okay

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,000
let's go through these steps

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:51,390
finding these usages you probably want

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,400
to set up something very bare-bones at

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,970
least some kind of Google Alert for your

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,500
project name actually this is something

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,240
that you will want to do for your

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,220
project anyway because you want to know

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,380
who's using it who's writing about it

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,690
just there there yeah I've done

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:10,709
something nice so this is like a

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:12,390
by-product identifying box infringing is

00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:14,010
a bit more tricky because you then have

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,459
to reach out to your community and

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,930
decide which way to go

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,060
actively fight and fringe

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,310
it sounds like going to a lawyer and

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,500
going to court

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,930
quite honestly often it's just typing up

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,550
an email hey such-and-such this is our

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,160
open source project what you're doing is

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,370
not allowed and typically people will

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:39,450
react and typically you will find the

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:41,840
solution that doesn't involve going to

00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,840
lawyers

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,620
okay so much was the easy part

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,610
let's go for the trickier part which is

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:53,460
people how many of you still believe in

00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,620
the loan heckle I there's a loan hacker

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,370
which does a very successful project and

00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,650
which conquers the world

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,690
okay so we all know that software

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,150
doesn't evolve from one bright mind

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:09,720
alone successful projects tend to have a

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,680
diverse and very large community or

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,800
translated it in my opinion the project

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,750
without people's is a dead project

00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,540
translated to Apache speak community

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:25,410
over code translated to cerium kyookie

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:28,260
speak people before code you probably

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,950
have similar sentences for many large

00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:34,070
open source projects so what people

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:38,220
aspects am I talking about

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:40,410
I'm talking about at first about users

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,260
where do you find them how do you find

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,110
users there's a term for that actually

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,870
it's very well known to probably

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:49,580
everyone in this room it's called

00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,740
marketing

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,500
what does marketing look like well

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,630
fenoli oh you go to Twitter you create a

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,090
Twitter account for your project you get

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,310
create a hashtag for your project you

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:06,120
create tweets about your project you

00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:08,130
create a search for your project name in

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,830
order to figure out which people are

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,450
using your project what people are doing

00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:17,340
with your project what they are saying

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:21,030
about you just a little anecdote from

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:23,160
Apache mouths it's very very unlikely

00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,310
that people came up to me and told me

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,390
what they are doing as a project

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,010
oftentimes I got involved in

00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,160
conversations on Twitter where people

00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,810
were sharing slight slight sex

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,660
where people were searching for people

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:38,819
that had those skills for a new job and

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,860
then get into the conversation in order

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:42,269
to find out what they were doing with

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,300
the project which use cases they found

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:48,029
useful people very seldom were self

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,509
identifying the next step then was to

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,589
talk to them whether it would be okay to

00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:56,040
identify what they were doing on a

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:58,290
public web page we always had a web page

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,569
wiki page actually which was called

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,050
powered by mahute where we were tracking

00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:04,860
those use cases like why would we do

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,660
something like that

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,550
well first of all it's nice for yourself

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,500
if you've written to software to know

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,480
about it however it's also nice if you

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,779
want to do a press release about your

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,790
project to be able to cite company X Y

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,480
and that are being are using your

00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:27,329
project as another anecdote I once went

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,329
to a patek on in Amsterdam and we had a

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:34,759
couple of leucine and solo talks there I

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:39,240
think it must have been in 2008 or 2009

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:42,779
serious in presentations by the core

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,060
developers by the founders but what c1

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:48,569
presentations that was most interesting

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:51,480
to people there was by downstream users

00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:54,269
of the project they were giving praise

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,069
for the project like a third party brace

00:16:54,269 --> 00:17:03,180
that wasn't coming from within the

00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:07,289
project and this was very helpful what

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,390
other aspects are we talking about there

00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:17,549
anyone in the room who still remembers

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:20,339
this slide one two three three this was

00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:24,360
how I first heard about the scholar

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:29,250
language back in 2009 it was a it's

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:33,110
always rainy weekend and Brussels free

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:35,400
university someone on stage

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,760
explaining something about a scalable

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,760
language

00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:43,160
what's called them so you go if you

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,700
start your own project what you probably

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,700
want to do is to go to other open-source

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,920
conferences is to go to other corporate

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,220
conferences and talk about what you are

00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:59,230
doing the goal there is to find users

00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:03,800
and to find users which later on you can

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,930
convert into contributors next step of

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,809
course you go for your own conference

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,920
like we have here today several years

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,510
later something else you can do for

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,660
marketing you can talk to the press

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,540
directly something I've done years ago

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,150
I've contacted both Heinz and software

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,270
support media in Germany which are like

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,220
large IT publishers there and they were

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,370
very happy to work together with me so

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:33,320
with every release of the project we

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,960
would write a press release ahead of

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,660
time then this release to the editors

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,210
they would come up with an article

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,720
scheduled it for our release date so

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:47,480
that we had decent coverage on the day

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,120
of the release so this is not something

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,309
that happens at random and this is not

00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,130
something that happens magically

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:58,370
automatically what is typically driven

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:00,110
by the project itself what else can you

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,780
do you can write books if you've got the

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,940
time for it I only got so far as

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,910
reviewing book centers already - quite

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:12,770
at all and you can publish of course

00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:16,010
your documentation in printed form with

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,309
documentation we are at the second

00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,320
bubble which is called training so if

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:23,870
you've got human beings which are

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,330
interested in your project and which one

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,670
you want to use it there are people who

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,400
are happy learning about how to use the

00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,140
software just from reading documentation

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,700
but most of the people that I talk to

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:39,920
they are happy to get a brief

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:44,960
explanation so what will you do you will

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:47,390
give talks at conferences you will

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,140
probably spend time in the hallway track

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,830
of conferences exchanging ideas and just

00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,590
egg

00:19:51,830 --> 00:20:00,049
anecdote I gave her a course on machine

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,240
learning and open source at Technical

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:05,149
University Berlin couple years ago at

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,220
some point I was too lazy to prepare

00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,659
this life so that I told my students hey

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,240
here are the tickets for Berlin

00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:14,600
buzzwords come to us what you have to do

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,450
in turn is to interview our speakers so

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,950
students were interviewing everyone

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,019
except that one keynote speaker which

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,769
was extremely relevant to use their

00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:28,159
course the speaker was about big data

00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:30,380
and machine learning why didn't they

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,710
interview this guy super jester shiny

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:37,370
fitted in the pro gym I told the speaker

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,600
it was Ted Dunning he was like that they

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,940
were too shy okay

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,090
I'll take a train ticket go to this

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,649
course and talk to these people and

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,620
turns out you don't have to be shy to

00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:50,179
talk to you those people here on stage

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,929
they are usually very happy to answer

00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:56,779
questions also you will go to

00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:58,730
conferences and have have a booth where

00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:00,409
you introduce a project or where you

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,539
inter introduce the topics that you're

00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:04,519
interested in so some things that the

00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:07,010
Apache Software Foundation you learned a

00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,980
couple years ago to do at FOSDEM there's

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:14,299
a ASF fools at FOSDEM where you can get

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:16,399
stickers and doesn't work but we can

00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:18,769
also learn about the foundation so what

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:23,230
they learn there go to where your users

00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:23,230
are and start the conversation they're

00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:31,340
speaking about going to where your users

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:33,230
are once you've taught your users how to

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,409
use the software they will have

00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:39,710
questions answering questions what does

00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:41,809
it that equate to we again there's a

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:46,519
very trivial term for that it's called

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:48,940
support all the time you will have

00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,700
beginner questions

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,700
well this beginner questions ever stop

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,289
no there will always be beginners in my

00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,659
personal opinion there is no dumb

00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:02,210
questions just only dump answers obvious

00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,190
missing documentation so if you have the

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,600
same question repeatedly over and over

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,110
go to your document

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,299
Paige and fix that one help beginners

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,940
get started gives them a good first-time

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,030
impression often times those will turn

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,570
into your most successful contributors

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:25,010
how are there any students here or any

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:26,600
university people okay couple just a

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,910
hint there is something called Google

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,010
Summer of Code regular pays students to

00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:34,840
contribute to open source tell that your

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:37,669
students we've had several successful

00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,400
students contributing Mahmood most of

00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:43,309
them stuck around for several years some

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,880
of them are still active one of them is

00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:48,470
now mentoring another student so this

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,000
program actually works if you put the

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:56,510
time into it where else do you want to

00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,110
look clearly Stack Overflow and other

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:02,330
fora you can answer questions there you

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,850
can recruit new people fetch them from

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,010
where they are direct them into whatever

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:14,650
resources you provide for your project

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:17,659
as an aside if this is not your project

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,549
contributing to open source doesn't only

00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,530
means that you have to contribute code

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:23,390
it can also mean that you can subscribe

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,240
to the mailing list or go to the forum

00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:29,840
and also use the questions continuously

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,299
at the patima which we've handed out the

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,490
commits a bit as a kind of thing thank

00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:36,350
you to people who didn't contribute a

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,370
single line of code but who helped

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:43,450
others get started and who put or who

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,490
took care of some of this support load

00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:48,140
and took that away from the core

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:53,630
contributors who could send focus on

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,220
coding speaking of helping others what

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,260
other contributions are out there is

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,590
there projects which are widely known

00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,539
and which have a user base that isn't

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:04,700
technical and which have a user base

00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,370
which doesn't speak whatever the main

00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,350
language of the project is successful

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,220
contributions can also be something like

00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,500
translating translating documentation

00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:18,140
Libre Office had a very famous

00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:21,060
translation project Libre offers

00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:24,240
was like founded as a project they had a

00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:26,310
lot of German code comments so they put

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,500
out it challenged asking everyone in

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,590
Germany and everyone speaking German to

00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,620
go and translate code comment lines also

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,660
counting that as a contribution

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:43,380
after all it helps developers understand

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:45,780
the code better now I am barely old

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:49,200
enough to remember the time when we had

00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:51,630
use not when mailing lists were hip and

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,020
great where people were communicating

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:58,140
over IRC it took me a while to

00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,670
understand that some people are

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,070
uncomfortable with using these

00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:05,640
interfaces and said using something like

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:11,970
for instance discuss can help beginners

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:16,200
get started with a project okay

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:19,080
something else now you've got people

00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,090
using your project and probably they are

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,450
finding issues and they are telling you

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,400
about them but they are creating issues

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,160
in your issue tracker and they are

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,220
creating more issues than you can fix so

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,870
suddenly we are at a topic again pretty

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,070
standard for software engineering which

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:42,300
is called prioritization there's two to

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:45,360
title to that coin first side is there's

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,300
just too many issues created you can't

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,060
fix all of them at some point you will

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:54,120
have to reach out for help and what

00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:56,520
happened what projects typically do is

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,430
that people tell you Petra's welcome

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:01,680
pull request welcome on first scientist

00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,720
sounds like pushing people away but

00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,970
honestly from my personal experience

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,100
this is just some a means of telling you

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:11,010
hey I don't have the bandwidth this is

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:16,170
really what you need please get involved

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:17,700
and probably stick around longer and

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,710
apache we have a saying that those who

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,460
do the work other ones taking the

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:25,800
decisions taken to the extreme I am

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,220
organizing meetups or I used to organize

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,840
meetups for quite some time if people

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,640
were coming up to me and telling me hey

00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,799
so starting time doesn't

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,360
for me it's just too early I will tell

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,420
them diesel speaker next time and you

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,360
are the one setting the date and time

00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:44,520
not only this is take a lot of the anger

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,380
out of the conversation it also gave me

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,380
a lot of speaker volunteers suddenly

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,140
another side of the coin is you need to

00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,940
manage expectations don't promise

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,580
features that you're unlikely to get

00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:05,429
done in the short term instead and wide

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,530
others to help you contribute it's

00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:11,309
something that I did for apache' mahute

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:13,080
a long time ago the issues that we had

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:14,429
was the people thought in order to

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,690
become a committer you would have to

00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:17,400
implement a new machine learning

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,570
algorithm and gets a tentative project

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,370
so we've got a lot of people

00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,150
volunteering hey I'm going to implement

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:25,950
X why's that if you will like oh no what

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,910
we really need is someone to write

00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:32,190
documentation examples we need someone

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:37,110
to do code reviews we needed someone to

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:40,140
you whatever so at some point I sat down

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,299
and wrote a an email to the user list a

00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,820
call to action emo where we were very

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:48,600
very I was very explicit about what we

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,030
needed and suddenly people realized oh

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,350
they don't need to get another

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,960
implementation of an algorithm instead

00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:59,179
they need X Y Zed where I can get active

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:05,970
so this led to much more activity

00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:07,530
shortly thereafter and other things that

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,809
you can do is to go to your issue

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:13,740
tracker and mark issues as beginner

00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:16,860
issues and it's a little story behind

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,130
that we once had a hadoop meeting in

00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:23,130
Berlin where some of the core Hadoop

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,900
people were there and some of the users

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,880
of Hadoop were there so we read ring

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,830
hands up session of which topics are you

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,510
interested in hacking on was like a

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:35,549
hackathon singing the topics that one

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,830
was very surprising to me most of the

00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:40,020
people attending wanted to be taken

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,970
through the process of submitting a code

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:46,049
change to the projects they wanted to be

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:49,870
taken through for the project check

00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:52,120
out-build it make it change create a

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,690
patch from that submits a patch to the

00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,820
project and then watch houses being

00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:00,640
integrated behind the scenes like which

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,740
CI jobs are being run over that which

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,900
checks are being run what do they have

00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,410
to expect to be posted automatically

00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:11,140
what kind of response time from

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,870
commuters do I have to expect and when

00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,630
do I probably see this patch online in a

00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:19,330
release for Mises was surprising because

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,580
the whole process was very apparent to

00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,049
me because I was living in it however

00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,150
was in this meeting they're receiving

00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:32,169
software developers who had no idea how

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:35,230
this process would look like okay so how

00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:38,980
does this look like in the hood we've

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:42,130
got an issue tracker eg those issues

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:46,419
that our beginner issues are being being

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:48,490
marked ok next step

00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,750
you've got your contributors as far as

00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,890
as they are already contributing patches

00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,450
what you now have to think about is a

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,789
reward system how do you keep them

00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:58,539
motivated to come to come back to your

00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:01,450
project

00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:05,580
sort of like gamey fiying said while i

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:08,020
am talking about so here's the patch

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,760
oftentimes is something where the

00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,179
developer has been scratching their own

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,580
each one since this is submitted the

00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,409
clock starts ticking there's only so

00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:21,070
much time set your contributor can spend

00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:23,260
on refining that patch they are probably

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:25,179
doing this during working hours or they

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,280
are doing it as a side project but they

00:30:25,179 --> 00:30:28,380
don't have hours and weeks and months to

00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,280
spend on this

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:35,140
especially if typically they are having

00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,179
their head wrapped around a different

00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,950
topic so they are convex switching

00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:41,440
between what they have contributed to

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,770
you and to what they are working on at

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,260
date time

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:49,690
ok you want to make you want to give

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,700
feedback very early how do you

00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,640
accomplish this I know you're very fast

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,169
with doing code reviews or you have at

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,900
least some automated checks in place

00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:02,020
already if you go to Apache Hadoop

00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,570
and that made a patch safe got coached

00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,970
code style tracks they've got checks for

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,800
weather and code coverage in Greece or

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,370
whether you didn't submit a unit test

00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,500
with your patch all those very easy and

00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,740
technical stuff that's being checked

00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,920
automatically so you can go back to

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:24,780
refining what you've done without any

00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,780
human intervention at the project site

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,280
in addition to that you also want to

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,160
have clear rules what on what

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:35,230
constitutes an acceptable patch and you

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,570
wanna have clear rules on which types of

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:41,110
features you are looking for nothing

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:44,200
puts people off as much as working hours

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:47,230
days weeks and months refining a patch

00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,480
and making it lovely and shiny and then

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,250
having then being told that it's

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,040
rejected because it doesn't match

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:58,929
whatever the vision of the project so

00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:04,240
it's very frustrating okay how do you

00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:07,750
reward people you can ship chocolate as

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,960
well when I wrote my first patch back on

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:14,320
I think 2008 it was for the drools

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,840
project was part of my day drop I

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,210
submitted the patch and asked the

00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,620
maintainer hey is this even interesting

00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,950
should I talk to my manager was I

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:26,110
allowed to send it to you it was like oh

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,270
yes that's totally interesting he I'll

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,990
give you let me sing some iTunes file

00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:34,270
dress it was like me I was already

00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,700
having a patchy mood going so I told him

00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,230
hey you've got a block I'll send you a

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,550
little blog post if you want to do me a

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,020
favor just put it online

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:45,370
I'll talk my manager to my manager so as

00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:48,340
soon as I knew that the thing was

00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:51,400
interesting I went to the head of the

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:55,410
R&D department asked him is it okay to

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,760
submit that and apparently it was okay

00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,460
what was much more helpful afterwards

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,070
was that Michaels a guy on the other at

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:06,040
the other end of the planet he was

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:09,040
actually sitting down in Australia so

00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,290
thank you what do I mean by saying thank

00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,860
you he put my name on the issue tracker

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,370
and he put

00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:18,160
my name in the commit comment he put it

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:20,650
on the in the release notes so I could

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,679
take these lab results go back to the

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:26,530
manager of R&D and say hey this is where

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,460
we are being mentioned and so we got

00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:33,250
some publicity more or less for free and

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,860
this helped convince this part person to

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,679
support me and others in the company

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,640
going forward making further patches so

00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,830
just saying thank you and doing this not

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,780
just as a hate thanks for doing this but

00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:48,970
thanks for doing this because such and

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,940
such and such can be very helpful and

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,770
can be very motivating actually thank

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:57,900
you it's like the cheapest reward that

00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,900
you have in your open-source project

00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:06,040
thank you only go so far there is a risk

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,510
that you might may run into the problem

00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:11,230
of having people who contribute a lot

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:13,810
probably even after hours at some point

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:16,899
in time well at the beginning they are

00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,070
usually very motivated and they do a lot

00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:22,450
for your project

00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:24,639
however this incurs this there is an

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,399
inherent risk that at some point they

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,340
will feel like they've invested too much

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,050
so at some point you won't want to get

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:35,409
out and find sponsorship for these

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:38,020
people either donations they funnel

00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,240
through foundations or you may want to

00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:41,800
find some VC funding or you may want to

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,220
find them a job where they can do

00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:48,399
whatever they are doing full-time why is

00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,649
that on you if you are very central to

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,690
this project you probably have links to

00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:56,250
many downstream users and you probably

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,570
have a very active social network

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:01,270
newcomers and rookies in your project

00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:03,609
don't have that so it does pay to watch

00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,359
out for these people and to help them

00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:11,590
find paid time in order to do what they

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,390
love doing as soon as you enter the

00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,160
business of doing what you love love

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,770
doing for money you will enter the

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,070
business of having men multiple hats on

00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,070
your head

00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,170
there are points in time where you want

00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:30,710
to make explicit which hat you are

00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:32,660
wearing we had a keynote speaker at

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,820
Berlin buzzwords who was talking about

00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,950
the issues that Apache Hadoop had like

00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,290
community issues technical issues etc

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,750
this person was working for a company

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:46,040
consultancy company which was selling an

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:47,450
alternative file system for Hadoop he

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,580
was running his keynote with his

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,310
corporate slides

00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,680
however he was he had prepared the

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,840
content with just his community hat on

00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,150
his head

00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:02,180
it was totally from a position of being

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,150
one of the Hadoop open source project

00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,780
contributors however the keynote wasn't

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,790
well-received until the very end and

00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:13,280
both the keynote speaker and some of his

00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,540
colleagues very very very confused about

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,540
why this keynote hadn't been

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,760
well-received so we talked to a couple

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,830
of people and what was irritating to

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,470
people was to see the company local on

00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:27,290
each and every slide in the bottom right

00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:29,480
corner because that made everyone think

00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:31,580
like oh my gosh he's starting to bash

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,430
Hadoop in order to sell off his product

00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,200
no he wasn't he was talking about a

00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,060
brighter future for Apache Hadoop and

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,370
what the project should do this was his

00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,440
conclusion but until we reached this

00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:48,490
conclusion everyone was suspicious about

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:51,440
what's coming up after that this person

00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,560
came up with a rules that he was wearing

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,720
a head said was showing his company logo

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,670
and if he was talking about the project

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,150
only he would go on stage had on his

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:03,740
head and removed the hat he was really

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,680
just talking about the open-source

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,420
project for various political reasons he

00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:15,640
doesn't do this right now because it was

00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,640
a red head was you get the idea okay

00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:21,190
speaking of money what do you need

00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,190
funding for

00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,210
whole thing is easy today these days

00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,790
you've got hit get up it's very cheap

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,369
and easy this service is like to reverse

00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,910
a CI which are free one thing you may

00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:36,590
want to make sure those watch was free

00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:40,340
for a long time as Welland was very

00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:42,740
popular it's no longer if you want your

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,930
project to survive for decades to come

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,510
you at least want to think about what it

00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,460
would take to move your communication

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,980
and your code and your changes

00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,390
essentially all your paper trail also

00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,210
service that you're currently using to

00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,070
something else this is also why I took

00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:00,530
so long for the Apache Software

00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:03,230
Foundation to embrace github what they

00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:05,330
had to first resolve was how do we make

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,670
sure that the history of our projects is

00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,590
preserved how do we make sure that

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,790
contributions actually come from the

00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:15,950
people that we think they are coming

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:17,420
from also keep in mind that there are

00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,480
some companies which are handing out

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,250
software licenses for free - free and

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,250
open source and developers like for

00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:29,090
instance IntelliJ or the your kit

00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:31,609
profilers also they are ways to get free

00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:36,140
compute resources from well-known cloud

00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:38,359
providers so that's the hard metal stuff

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,180
what else do you need funding for you

00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:44,210
will need funding for the times that you

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:47,359
work on the project you will need time

00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:50,090
to configure your infrastructure you

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:56,440
will need time to do non-coding work

00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:59,510
like press work just a little

00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,570
advertisement you can donate to the ASF

00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:07,119
we've got very few paid people will most

00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:07,119
of Cisco's - machines and infrastructure

00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:14,060
okay next up communication how do you

00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,770
communicate your project what do you

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,550
need to think about first is a clear

00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:22,310
vision statement for paragraph what do

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,650
you want to do more importantly what is

00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,930
it that you don't want to do so that

00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,470
once you have people suggesting features

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:32,540
you've got a clear reason whether this

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,490
belongs to the project or not so you

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,360
don't have like feature creep or you

00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,480
don't have long

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:42,980
rainbowers about wises features relevant

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,010
or not relevant how do you want to

00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,740
communicate within your project

00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,240
typically if you work on a co-located

00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,520
company what you will have for the mass

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,890
media where people communicate next to

00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,540
the coffee machine if you go to popular

00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,580
open-source projects people will be in

00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,950
Sydney people will be in Copenhagen

00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,860
people will be in Berlin people will be

00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,800
in say Washington DC a San Francisco

00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,170
wherever there's no coffee machine to

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,850
accommodate for this so you will

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,900
probably want to have a central hub

00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,600
where you collect all your

00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,510
communications and you probably will

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:21,020
want to have one central hub where you

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:23,960
take all your important decisions say

00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:28,190
see is red do I want to have to check

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,470
slack commits mailing lists discussion

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,410
fora in order to figure out whether this

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:35,540
issue or has already been resolved no I

00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:39,080
want to go to one source makes it much

00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:42,860
easier do we want to use the central

00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:45,410
public up for all issues e there are

00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,650
some personal issues that you don't want

00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:51,020
to discuss in public if two people have

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,940
like a personal disagreement gets them

00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:57,140
together in one room or at least in one

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:59,540
video chat to resolve that typically

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:04,630
zero turnaround time is much faster than

00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,630
ups and if you go save for mails etc

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:11,690
also sign resolving conflicts what do

00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:14,690
you need communication channels for you

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:17,120
will need to motivate your people you

00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:20,060
will need a channel to find consensus on

00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,750
which direction to move to on whether

00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,460
patch buzzer - except the patch or not

00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,890
you will need a channel to get feedback

00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,390
on your project it's a good while you're

00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,180
doing what are people doing with your

00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:34,130
project where should you go next you

00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,740
want to you want to have channels or you

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,330
can teach and learn and you want to have

00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:43,260
channels where you can set goals and

00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:45,240
direction central slice

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,369
if you have a face-to-face meeting like

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,770
we are having today it's awesome because

00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:54,270
if we are talking to each other we can

00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:56,760
see our faces we can hear the language

00:41:54,270 --> 00:42:02,369
we can see what our hands are doing and

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:04,619
we can did use but what we say is irony

00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:07,109
over so we actually mean it that way or

00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:12,200
result sarcastic there's a lot of

00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:15,410
information that flows that is not words

00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,420
however it's fairly expensive to set up

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:20,250
you cannot see an organizers for how

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,140
much they pay for this menu and you can

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:24,270
ask each and every one of you how much

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:29,150
it costs to travel here and to pay for

00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:33,350
the stay at the hotel plus what it takes

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:35,850
away in terms of coding time at work

00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:39,090
although it's not particularly durable

00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:41,160
you can't videotape each and every

00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:43,230
hallway conversations that you have said

00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,820
some things that only the two or three

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:49,770
of you are taking back home and we're

00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:52,410
sharing with everyone else okay let's

00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:55,260
take a step further we take video chat

00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:57,869
now we don't have to travel but we still

00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:02,700
have to find time where every one of us

00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:05,310
has time for that chat imagine people

00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,619
sitting in Sydney San Francisco and

00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:11,510
Berlin try finding your time where

00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,920
everyone is awake and not sleepy tricky

00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,619
you can go ahead and make this more

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,300
durable by videotaping it okay imagine

00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:20,760
your project is 10 years old and you

00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,100
have to watch 10 years worth of video

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,990
chatting doesn't sound like a fun

00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:31,380
experience let's take a little bit more

00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:35,609
pencils out of the loop and go for

00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:38,330
online group chat text chat say IRC say

00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:42,030
HipChat says like say whatever is the

00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:43,830
newest and coolest kid the cantaloupe

00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,440
and once we don't hear Joseph speaking

00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,540
we don't see each other but at least

00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,660
it's still synchronous so we get

00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,300
feedback very fast if something was

00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,420
understood incorrectly we can ask and we

00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,510
can get feedback

00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,640
it's rather cheap to set up you just

00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:04,849
need a tool and internet tax access

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:08,089
pretty durable you can store it you can

00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:12,680
search the locks it's still not

00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:16,039
particularly structured well structured

00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,109
even though slack is adding threads and

00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:19,910
it's not particularly good in order to

00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:25,400
track project history because it's very

00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:27,140
fine fine level of detail you can go for

00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,700
web forum now you've got a little bit

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:34,970
more structure topics of the post on the

00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:38,420
same topic are grouped pretty durable

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:42,559
you can search it same is true

00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:48,130
essentially for mailing lists you can

00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:51,859
give you can go one one level higher and

00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:53,660
create an issue tracker it's fairly

00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:56,150
structured everything that belongs to

00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,390
one issues tracked in one conversation

00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:01,430
including patches everything it's still

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,980
pretty fine-grained imagine that after

00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,710
10 years you have to reconstruct the

00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,960
history of a project just from JIRA

00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,549
issues or just from github issues some

00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,579
things that I am being faced with right

00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:15,710
now for Apache mahute the original

00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:18,529
creators of the project have been asked

00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:20,539
to write down in a very concise way the

00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:22,579
history of the project because

00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:23,299
essentially the people have changed

00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:25,069
entirely

00:45:23,299 --> 00:45:27,950
it's now being run by different people

00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:31,730
but those who are now there want to know

00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:35,240
where we are coming from something that

00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:38,329
we encountered a couple weeks ago we had

00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,789
a little green elephant in the very

00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:43,220
beginning as our logo and switched to a

00:45:40,789 --> 00:45:45,500
yellow one two or three years later a

00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,849
couple weeks ago all new people found

00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,920
the green elephant and they're like

00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:51,069
what's this doing here what's this logo

00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,720
about we don't know what is this and

00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:55,519
everyone he knew about the old logo and

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,200
knew about the five t-shirts that were

00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,200
printed in Berlin and shipped out to the

00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,380
world they pretty much have left mailing

00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:05,359
list so we are now left with the task of

00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,359
figuring out what are the milestones of

00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:10,160
status project went through this is

00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:14,559
something that you can't deduce just

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,180
issued tracker or email mailing list so

00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,609
at some point you want to write up this

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:23,569
history and these milestones either in a

00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:26,420
wiki which is well structured somewhat

00:46:23,569 --> 00:46:28,279
depends on your discipline or you want

00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,789
to write it up your on your webpage just

00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:35,470
ever where do we come from so that your

00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:38,450
project has a memory and so that all

00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:45,140
technical decisions and non-technical

00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:47,180
positions are part of that speaking of

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,920
all those communication channels what

00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,640
you want to make sure of is to have one

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:56,450
and only one column canonical place

00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:58,569
where you keep your current status you

00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:02,869
want to provide this as a self service

00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:07,369
where you keep documentation and very

00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:10,339
attract previous decisions at apaches

00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:12,319
this is typically and very old school

00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:13,910
mailing us there is a say in which goes

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,430
what didn't happen on the mailing list

00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:18,410
didn't happen whatever you choose as a

00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:22,359
channel doesn't matter it just has to be

00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,359
one and one that works for you

00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:29,230
speaking of being active in these

00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:32,029
projects for a long time you want to

00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:35,509
think about mental health issues as well

00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:37,609
you want to think about what it how to

00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:40,880
detect people who are taking up too much

00:47:37,609 --> 00:47:46,430
work how many of you know about the lick

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:48,890
cookie effect okay one one two maybe

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,529
okay click cookie effect you've got an

00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:53,450
issue tracker you've got issues in there

00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:56,450
you want to find volunteers to fix these

00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:58,400
issues you've probably all encountered

00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:01,809
someone who's acting like the following

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:05,720
on certain issues I'm going to do it

00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:09,799
silence for days for weeks for months

00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:11,779
nothing changes essentially this is like

00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:14,299
little children going to the people

00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:17,180
licking the cookie nobody to end dares

00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:19,210
to touch this cookie again especially if

00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:21,769
this is a high profile contributor

00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,940
nobody is going to touch this issue so

00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:26,480
you want to have some

00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:29,660
of process in place in order to avoid

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,480
this and trust me don't rely on people

00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,540
letting go of these tickets this won't

00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,369
happen you will probably want to have a

00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,520
policy where everyone watches out for

00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:43,609
these issues and where people aren't

00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,470
trying to go up even to the founder of

00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:46,730
the project hey now you're really going

00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:49,099
to work on that you haven't done

00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:52,569
anything for the past two weeks maybe

00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,569
someone else would like to take it up

00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:58,839
these people who are volunteering a lot

00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:01,910
why why do they do that it feels good

00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:03,980
you're helping other people but at some

00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:06,619
point you will have added too much load

00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,560
in order to be productive and effective

00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:13,430
anymore at Apache service animal which

00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:16,490
was posted a long time ago which coins

00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:18,040
the term volunteer it is for that I'm

00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:20,630
gonna set up the mailing list for that

00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,119
I'm gonna write this little patch I'm

00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,950
going to get into organizing this meetup

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,730
for youth and at some point nothing

00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:29,300
happens

00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:32,089
so you want to think very clearly about

00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:35,119
what you volunteer for because other

00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:37,010
people relies on you doing that and you

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,910
also want to what your peers whether

00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:42,349
what they volunteer for actually happens

00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:44,540
something that's really bad is having

00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:47,060
someone in your community where the

00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,460
whole understanding of everyone else is

00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,260
like okay he's volunteering again but

00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:55,990
he's never doing anything so don't trust

00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:58,460
him don't rely on him it's pretty bad

00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:01,010
just not only mental health it's also

00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,349
physical health if you don't believe me

00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:08,300
you should watch a keynote from Berlin

00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:11,270
buzz words I believe 2015 it was where

00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:13,490
Eric Eric Evans shared his story of how

00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:15,230
many surgery around trips he went

00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:18,190
through in order to get his hands and

00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:20,540
wrists back to working state after

00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:24,349
spending hours and days and months

00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:27,140
trying to get his prosthetic to fly so

00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:29,720
Mason it may look a little bit funny

00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,920
having this little cat here but it's not

00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,920
quite so funny a topic

00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:40,609
now you've got your project on its way

00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:44,540
it's growing successful you've got

00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:46,820
startups contributing full-time what you

00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,710
end up with is a project we have a gap

00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,020
between those contributing fault

00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,730
full-time and those who still want to

00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,520
get in the loop but don't have the time

00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,980
for that so you will need to manage this

00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,390
kind of communication gap you will need

00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:01,520
to figure out how to give those who

00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:03,619
don't have the time to read each and

00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,750
every issue and each and every content

00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:08,060
to give them like a digest of what's

00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:11,000
going on so that they are still in the

00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:14,810
loop also you probably want to think

00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,720
about how to detect someone who is in

00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:19,400
absolute numbers not contributing as

00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,520
much as everyone else because everyone

00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,950
else is paid full time to work on the

00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:28,400
project but who still puts in a

00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:31,970
sustainable effort in order to give them

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,589
similar rewards why would you want to do

00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:36,640
that first of all these people probably

00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:38,780
are important as well as they are also

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,690
interested in your project as they also

00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:44,450
put work into it but also if someone if

00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:46,369
you communicate that you're open and you

00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:48,740
have someone who's on a sustainable pace

00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:50,720
but on a very low level of contributing

00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:53,450
and doesn't get the rewards they will

00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,530
become grumpy over time and this will be

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:56,530
very bad for your reputation

00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:02,030
speaking about reputation at some point

00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,570
you will need to deal with poisonous

00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:04,430
people

00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:07,310
what do I talk about when I say

00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:10,460
poisonous people there are trolls out

00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:13,520
there who's so fun and purpose is to

00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:16,640
create flame wars on your communication

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:19,300
channel it will drop a ball everyone

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:24,080
jumps on that ball takes it apart

00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:25,430
discusses and fights each other after

00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,280
weeks here looking up where's the troll

00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:31,300
he's gone what he had was a lot of fun

00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:33,859
watching you there's also people

00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,750
draining energy and time from the

00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:38,450
project without actually contributing

00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:41,390
value how do you deal with these people

00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:44,359
sales talks by : Sussman and Francis

00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:47,089
Patrick their idea was to collect data

00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:48,280
on who is draining energy from the

00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:51,110
project

00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,330
there suddenly we are talking about not

00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:55,910
using public channels we're talking

00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:58,190
about people issues the idea here is to

00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:00,560
reach out to different community members

00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:03,560
getting feedback if they've got the same

00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,800
impression and then approaching this

00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:08,600
individual and bending some first of all

00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,550
talking to some hey you're doing

00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,320
something wrong did you notice can you

00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,390
change if they don't change or if they

00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:18,890
are resistant don't be afraid to bend

00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:20,990
them from your project list there's

00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,480
another talk for those of you are German

00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:28,270
speaking by Christian crop which deals

00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:31,850
was dealing frame Wars and breaking

00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:34,880
communications that broke down he was

00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:37,040
talking about times when use net was

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,360
still popular talking about the German

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:43,670
PHP Usenet group what are we in what he

00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,950
realized leading this group is that it's

00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,080
very hard to punish people of serious no

00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:49,760
punishment system you can always create

00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,660
a new account and come back to the

00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:57,560
project in order to make fun of it

00:53:52,660 --> 00:54:01,730
however would he set up was a system

00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:04,790
where a group of people agreed to not

00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:07,580
react emotionally to people who want to

00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:10,490
create flame wars she would keep an FAQ

00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:13,490
document where they had standard answers

00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:16,340
for contagious topics and every time

00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,620
someone wanted to draw the community

00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:21,590
into flame world they would link to this

00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:25,010
FAQ relevant to the question put a

00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:28,790
little disclaimer formulated in a very

00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:32,750
neutral tone and very quickly the

00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:35,240
discussion died down they also had not

00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:40,100
just one person do that but a network so

00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:41,630
that when Christian was totally upset

00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,250
and couldn't answer he could reach out

00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:45,280
to someone else and tell them hey can

00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,040
you take care of this conversation and

00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,690
what we learned through the system was

00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,250
those people back then who were trolling

00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:57,440
the project actually we're trying to get

00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:01,339
trying to get feedback trying to be

00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:03,920
recognized once you say realize that so

00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,479
people posting these faq entries those

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,150
people taking care of these

00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:08,960
conversations were getting a lot of

00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:11,509
publicity

00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,660
what these trolls are often turned into

00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:17,150
were the most valuable contributors and

00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:20,450
most valuable different defendants of

00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:22,279
that same system so you there are some

00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:29,210
people that you can actually turn into

00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:32,049
service ok nice but not least you will

00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:34,219
have to deal with change management you

00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:36,619
probably you don't want to run this

00:55:34,219 --> 00:55:38,900
project for your whole lifetime so you

00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:42,940
want to build handover into your project

00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:45,950
from the very start at Apache manhood

00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:47,559
run ingersoll myself and a couple others

00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:51,499
were very active from the very start

00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:54,109
grinding muffled decided to go emery

00:55:51,499 --> 00:55:58,039
toes a couple months ago because he

00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:59,839
didn't have the time anymore it took a

00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:02,119
couple of weeks in order to get his name

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,099
out of every system where he still was

00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:07,099
the single point of failure you don't

00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:11,299
want to have that what we established

00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:14,839
early on was four so at Apache you've

00:56:11,299 --> 00:56:17,089
got the notion of a PMC chair project

00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:19,400
management committee chair what does he

00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:22,809
do he doesn't have a lot of rights he

00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:26,960
all he does is to essentially the only

00:56:22,809 --> 00:56:29,150
duty he has to write up a report of like

00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,890
a quarterly report of what the project

00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,259
had been doing how the community is

00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:38,499
getting along and sending that off to Z

00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:42,380
Apache foundation board what we set up

00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:44,900
fairly early probably in the late was to

00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:47,599
rotate those positions through PMC

00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:50,450
members on a yearly basis so that

00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,029
everyone learns how to do this so that

00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:55,640
everyone knows how to bring on a new

00:56:53,029 --> 00:56:59,119
commit er how to give commits karma to

00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:04,579
people etc so this already made it

00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:07,549
fairly fairly smooth overall having a

00:57:04,579 --> 00:57:09,259
safe exit journey means you need to

00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:12,079
document the hell out of your project

00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:15,599
and you need to start very early with

00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:17,160
delegating tasks tasks otherwise you are

00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,930
going to survive and you will have a

00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:22,200
very hard time and spend years and years

00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:24,930
when it finally comes to handing over

00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,789
stuff and when you are in a position

00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:29,009
where you want to do your handover you

00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:33,440
probably don't have years and years time

00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:33,440
in order to go through this process and

00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:38,900
for that I'm open to questions from you

00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:53,670
you talked about not just investing time

00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:56,549
but also things like going to

00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:58,170
conferences and setting up a booth at

00:57:56,549 --> 00:58:01,400
the conference things which cost money

00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:03,720
in my experience at something most

00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,430
open-source volunteers don't want to

00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,809
invest they have their time to spend but

00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,940
they don't have money so you either need

00:58:06,809 --> 00:58:12,390
a business model or you need some

00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,460
nonprofit organization like Apaches it's

00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:15,839
something you could recommend or would

00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,759
you say it's better to do this from

00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,849
business model or how would a each

00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:23,729
standard private person go about this

00:58:20,849 --> 00:58:25,499
what's your take on this first of all

00:58:23,729 --> 00:58:28,799
there's no one solutions is everything

00:58:25,499 --> 00:58:32,670
it depends on what you want if you want

00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:35,759
a project that's Rendel neutral and sets

00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:38,759
your wive's people moving away and sets

00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:41,249
set up to survive for long term I would

00:58:38,759 --> 00:58:42,989
go for a non-profit I'm coming from the

00:58:41,249 --> 00:58:45,119
Apaches of a foundation so my personal

00:58:42,989 --> 00:58:50,039
recommendation is to go there your

00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:52,410
mileage may vary if for your project you

00:58:50,039 --> 00:58:54,269
want to make a living out of it you want

00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:58,589
to build a business on it I would go for

00:58:54,269 --> 00:59:00,239
either VC funding or for organic growth

00:58:58,589 --> 00:59:04,499
of your business I wouldn't necessarily

00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:06,180
go for a foundation like Lexus the way I

00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:11,039
would make that decision is how much

00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:12,749
control do you want if you want total

00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:15,239
control because you've got a business on

00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:17,910
top me personally I wouldn't go to

00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:21,259
Apache because there's these one of the

00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:26,190
