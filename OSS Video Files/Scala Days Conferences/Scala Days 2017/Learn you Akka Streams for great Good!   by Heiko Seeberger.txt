Abstract: 
Stream processing has become ubiquitous and Akka Streams, an implementation of the Reactive Streams specification, is one of the hottest kids on the block. In this talk we not only cover the essentials, but also introduce some advanced features like working with materialized values and cyclic graphs. As we strongly believe in writing code as the best way to learn coding, we show zero slides, but a lot of live code and live demos instead.
