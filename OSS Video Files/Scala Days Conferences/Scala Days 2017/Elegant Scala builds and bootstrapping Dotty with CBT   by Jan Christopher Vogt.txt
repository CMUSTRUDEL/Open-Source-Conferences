Abstract: 
Last year CBT, the new build tool for Scala, showed a simpler way to build Scala programs. But there were still a number of big open questions. Those have since been answered. We'll present elegant and simple solutions to task-scoping, dynamic configuration and multi-project builds. Finally we'll talk about the joined work with Scala Center to use CBT for bootstrapping Dotty and how we did it.
