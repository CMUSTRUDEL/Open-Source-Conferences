thank you everybody for for lasting this

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:12,799
long I think you've all had a wonderful

00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:15,920
couple of days you've been to many very

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,550
exciting very interesting very technical

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,360
talks so I think you will all all leave

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:26,990
here wiser than you arrived and I've

00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,470
done my mouth laughing have you have you

00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:33,010
left less wine okay might have might

00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,360
miles miles has lost some wisdom

00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:39,469
hopefully we can we can tap what remains

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,300
over the next most half an hour or so so

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:43,100
would you please give a round of

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:53,149
applause to all the speakers who have

00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:57,889
contributed to the Scala days thank you

00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:01,429
so I have here a a panel of I can count

00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:03,049
five Scarl illumine aries who are going

00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,430
to be able to answer or they're going to

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:08,719
try at least to answer some of your

00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,039
questions this afternoon and by the way

00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,810
which you'll probably experience

00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,610
experiencing this - we're all we're all

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,450
standing or sitting here with very

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,500
bright lights shining in our eyes and

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,020
it's a little bit like the Spanish

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,789
Inquisition

00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:29,750
I'm I made that joke once in Spain and

00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:31,700
got a much much deadly asylums deadlier

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,340
being the operative word

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,710
so I will I will spend a few minutes to

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,399
begin with just introducing each of them

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:46,100
and after that I'll then open open the

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:47,689
floor to questions and yes if you could

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,600
all be thinking about things you might

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:53,869
like to ask during during the opening

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,100
opening section keep keep them in mind

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,070
for a bit later on

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,520
so I'll start I'll stop at this end we

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,319
have our last Ferguson and my single

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,990
name correctly although I guess I'm

00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:11,180
elected yet although forgive okay and

00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:16,100
Olaf is an engineer at the Scarlet

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:18,150
centre right okay are you gonna check

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,290
everything I say

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,269
I'm gonna have to refer to my notes now

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:27,269
okay say and you develop scholar formats

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:27,269
yes

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,230
so it's a scholar format or scholar fmt

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,379
that's a good question I'd like to I

00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:38,500
call it scholar for math now actually

00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,879
okay right there I started doing that

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,349
like three days ago so okay so

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,629
rebranding scholar fmt is now scholar

00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:51,760
format yes public service announcement

00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:53,560
yes and and you've also been working

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,530
more recently on scholar fakes right

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,239
which is one of the probably the biggest

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,230
user of scholar Mehta at the moment is

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:06,760
that correct yeah McDonagh for Madam's

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,060
gotta fix both you've made quite a lot

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:14,470
okay and we tell people is about about

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:20,260
what scholar fix is going to do sure

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:22,780
it's a tool that does refactoring on

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:26,859
calico as many are familiar with in

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:30,540
IntelliJ that we we enjoy in our IDs but

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:32,909
the big difference is that it's it uses

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,319
symbols and types from the compiler

00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:37,780
which means that it can be a bit more

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,389
accurate so it's awesome right yeah

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,269
and and focus more on in terms of maybe

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:45,220
comment line interfaces in batch mode so

00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:47,049
that you can let's say everyone agree

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,489
that we should not have unused imports

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,940
in your project so then we can remove

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:54,459
them but the main goal of schematics is

00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:58,209
to have migrate between scalar versions

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,260
such as for example body if there's a

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,049
breaking change we can maybe

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,930
automatically migrate called so this is

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,699
going to be big for when people start

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,909
adopting Joffe and they have these fast

00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:12,310
code bases of scholar scholar 2.8 yeah

00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,129
and be amazing if we could automate some

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,389
of those breaking changes yeah okay and

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,359
we're aiming to do as much as we can

00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,470
with it of course it also changes the

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,579
debate that you know you can

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,579
automatically fix it them

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,250
great and moving right from your point

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,340
of view

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:38,090
Kelly Kelly Robinson you have flown here

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:40,789
from the US and you have I think you

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,560
have done as many transatlantic flights

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,389
for scarlet conferences that I have this

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,610
year which deserves a round of applause

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:53,449
in itself not not for me Kelly I can't I

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:56,229
can't help myself and you you work in

00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:59,750
the advertising industry is that true

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,970
yes I'm sorry you want to defend do you

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,810
want to defend yourself we keep the

00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:07,310
internet free you're welcome

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:12,139
okay so the intent is free thanks to

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:16,690
Kelly and it says it says here that

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:21,740
kelly loves free monitors is this true

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:23,180
who told you that I made it up so I

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:34,030
think the lesson here is don't listen to

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:36,889
anything John says okay I don't mine and

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,620
more seriously you you've you are you

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:45,340
have been instrumental in bringing about

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,340
a wave of scala bridges around the world

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,940
would you like to tell people how that

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,030
came about and what you're doing with

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,370
with scala bridge sure so scala bridge

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,710
is a organization that's modeled off of

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,960
several other bridge organizations the

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,050
first one was a rails bridge that was

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,120
started in 2007 and the idea is that you

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,250
do a one-day programming workshop for

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,349
people that don't know the language of

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,490
the framework that you're teaching and

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,139
it's especially targeted at

00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,090
underrepresented groups and so you give

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,180
them one day workshop a safe place to

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,550
learn a reason to go hack on some stuff

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,900
for a day and learn some stuff and it's

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,150
a really successful model but other

00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,280
languages have picked up and there's not

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,110
one for Scala or there wasn't one when I

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,560
started coming to Scala conferences and

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,410
so

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,639
I decided to start one and it's been

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,700
pretty cool we've done live in San

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,220
Francisco and Seattle and there was one

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,590
here before the conference Bothell

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,910
there's ones being planned in Vancouver

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,910
New York and London

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,750
sure yeah well now I'm announcing that

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,919
there's one in London so somebody that

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:59,810
was in London get on them so we have yet

00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,240
applause so it's people in the audience

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,979
who I mean a lot of people from all

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,260
around the world here if they are

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,479
interested in starting a Skylar bridge

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,150
group locals then should should they

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,750
come speak to you what should be their

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,720
next step

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,100
yeah so I can probably put it on the

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,220
website or if you go to the Twitter

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,320
twitter.com slash Scala bridge there's a

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,510
link there that has some information

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,190
about how to start a chapter or you can

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,889
contact me all the contact information

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,660
is forwarded to me right now so you will

00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,740
you will be able to get my ear if you

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,640
have a question about how to start a

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:40,669
chapter okay thank you

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:43,729
next we have Felix Mulder you have

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:57,350
you've been at EPFL for how many months

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:59,810
now a year and a half and you've worked

00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:00,830
on a couple of things that maybe people

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,729
have seen and haven't really realized

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,490
that Felix was was involved in them the

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,539
smarter error message is better error

00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,970
messages what would you call on them

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:13,240
they're all some error messages has

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:18,740
anyone seen all some error messages

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,570
variance there in Scala 212 3 there and

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,180
on eo2 just coffee

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:28,639
yes I think I think I can't take credit

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,550
for agents work

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,120
so I will add a question later and later

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,620
about scholars error messages so that

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,579
the visions of the and Eve also worked

00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,159
on improving Scala Docs that's true so I

00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:47,269
wrote the 212 Docs so that's my fault

00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,320
I'm sorry guys I think you just say you

00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:50,450
wrote the doc

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,570
you wrote the 212 but I wrote the

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:56,540
generator ah okay the truth is revealed

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,459
so and anyone who has noticed an

00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,279
improvement in in Scala talks that

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,529
they've seen online yes I was I wasn't

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,930
asking for hands up but people have

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:08,060
people people so eager to tell you that

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,570
they they enjoyed improvement has anyone

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:14,149
seen a degradation in quality no no

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,820
hands raised so well but well done

00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:18,769
I'm certainly very clean would be with

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:27,829
the improvement one last question

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:34,160
how much can you deadlift 606 what about

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:35,750
you one of one of the unit I'd grab 206

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,329
kilos I don't even know what that is in

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,970
freedom units I think that's up sir

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:48,829
Amalia Miriam you can applaud everyone

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:53,449
36 kilos moving to my to my left we have

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:55,310
miles fabin got your title here oh you

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:57,740
can check tackle be a partner and

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,320
underscore Consulting founder of light

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,800
level all through shape all through

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,070
shapers for cur of Scala type astronauts

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,260
slayer of FI 27 12 of which we could

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,600
play no more grand high priest of the

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,010
Church of functional programming

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,220
overlord of the type system destroyer of

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:20,269
microbes higher kind of type dog owner

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,690
and the garlic and scholar Eclipse

00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:25,110

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:30,540
[Laughter]

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:33,750
[Applause]

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,750
lest we forget

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,540
can you tell tell us what you're up to

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:45,250
at the moment why max the moment well

00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,570
the last last thing I did was I mean

00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:53,610
just generally not present minute

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,610
laughing I am here I'm about to holiday

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,300
so the last thing of any interest to two

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,790
people in this room that I did was put

00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,290
out the last release or title to our

00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:08,220
compiler which is my my ongoing and

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:12,190
possibly endless mission to make life

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,839
more comfortable for people who are

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,959
right it's got all the libraries in

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,500
there in the title style sort of pure

00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:23,019
type full functional style and that

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,320
libraries in the level ecosystem like

00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:28,660
harder for Adrian I'm doing my I'm doing

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,690
I'm doing I'm doing my best to help

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:37,079
Adrian out in that problem as well

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:40,209
possible well actually I guess I I

00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,310
missed out something up which is aa very

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,920
recent I've been involved in getting

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,529
things together for tomorrow which as

00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,320
everybody hopefully knows is the

00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,399
fabulous Linux attached to Copenhagen

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,380
which is in the same venue that is

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,480
probably still just enough time for one

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,770
or two people to sneak in if they if

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,700
they find themselves at a loose end

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,620
tomorrow and what else will then out I

00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,220
arrived you're not to meet sneak in or

00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,020

tomorrow who do who is okay and the

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,339
program is on the type of website

program great and finally last but not

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:41,800
least permanent fixture on these panels

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,080
welcome back agent good see Kai would

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,250

yes agent I think oh I'm so interacting

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,779
nicely to go questions yes a panel actor

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,720
yeah that's that's it actually

00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:04,120
yeah so uh freaks atrium Asian is the

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:08,279
the lead developer on the skull of C

00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,770
compiler at light Bend how things going

00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,300
yeah good good thanks yeah you're

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,010
getting lots of pull requests we are

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,459
yeah yeah why are you welcome to

00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,410

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:19,720
absolutely yeah they're all welcome yeah

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,080
some we can't merge but you know most of

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,420
them we do yeah okay and what what's the

00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,010
situation with bugs and scholar and

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,350
general are you making head on we don't

00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:33,310
have a heading bugs John what you said

00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,680
there is nothing on your screen this is

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,740
for my oh I make you gone up by how long

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,810
yeah please okay yeah no like okay

00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,310
that's good yeah no yeah I mean we you

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,649
know we do track them now on github so

00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,450
you can't use recently migrated yeah

00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,670
yeah that's my proudest achievement this

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:55,450
year so the I think that's where they

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:58,120
were rather okay we are so we are now on

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:01,060
I think the fourth iteration of a bug

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,890
tracker for the Scala compiler project

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,020
that's right and we still have like all

00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:08,860
the bugs I mean you know all the bugs

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,180
before we have slightly fewer but

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,770
actually probably have more bugs than we

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,820
did when we were using the track but

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:18,040
yeah well without the track we had Tara

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:19,630
before we know you we had the homegrown

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,880
yeah we have let me know we don't need

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,680
eleven Aladdin yeah yeah we've had a

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,709
bright orange backgrounds if anyone

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,690
remembers a school you know obviously no

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:34,209
medical area great and this should

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,890
hopefully make make the bug tracking and

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,589
we've definitely noticed a pickup and

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,990
report so we you know we basically in

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:44,050
your ammo log of people to pick up in

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:46,989
number bug reports a good work okay

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,850
all right you're not this is the most

00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,449
recent version of Skyler introduced more

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,939
bugs

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:53,619
oh I may have something a couple died I

00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,819
wouldn't really blame another release

00:14:53,619 --> 00:15:06,249
yeah okay so this is this is the panel

00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:08,679
please give them a warm welcome and if

00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:10,480
anyone has any questions please wave of

00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:16,420
me because it's it's still very

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:21,249
difficult to see and I will know we

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:23,499
haven't we had a great I I have a got

00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:27,610
some questions here but okay but what

00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:30,910
does the panel think about significant

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:41,350
white space in don't you leave about

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:43,319
more scholars you'll get you'll get you

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:47,019
get alone now you'll get the last word

00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:48,490
the question what is the what's going on

00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:50,649
with significant white space and daddy

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,139
like what's the proposal okay opening

00:15:50,649 --> 00:16:17,230
I'll let I'll let Felix describe the

00:15:53,139 --> 00:16:19,869
proposal briefly dibs on yes okay good

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:23,259
so the proposal is basically to remove

00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:26,170
what's to remove braces and replace

00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:30,610
certain pictures with width width the

00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:33,369
key word width and thus freeing up white

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:37,119
space in the code making it more elegant

00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:39,819
and of course this sparked enormous

00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:42,579
controversy in our community and but

00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:44,589
civil controversy I must add I was

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:47,410
really pleasantly surprised as there

00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:52,809
were no chairs thrown death threats and

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,850
that sort of thing slow oh that's true

00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:56,120
that's true the distributed community

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,540
it's hard for the chairs

00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,269
but no no figure to figurative chairs

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,730
were thrown either so that was great so

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,829
this is Martin's proposal this the right

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,169
Cecil came it came with a pull request

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:12,500
with an actual implementation it did and

00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:15,020
so the the current proposal is actually

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:18,799
a fairly trivial to implement in the

00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,679
parser because all it does is studied it

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,539
allows you to get rid of the braces by a

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:26,270
denoting them as a block if you have a

00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:28,669
width keyword and that's the gist of it

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,940
anyway okay and there was a huge amount

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:33,440
of discussion on on github so that is

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,679
that is the proposal um

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:40,460
miles what what did she what was your

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:44,179
initial visceral reaction can you

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,360
reenact it I I have to say I have

00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:52,730
actually bought every okay at all

00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:57,649
however a significant blank stare I

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,480
think okay significant secure no I mean

00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:02,179
I it's kind of I mean this is way way

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,460
way down to fatherlessness Lister points

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:07,159
in what was law so I right I thought

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,890
there was actually a competing offer

00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:13,279
I heard during this cut this conference

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,320
by a guy from the stock Amitabh odd who

00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:19,130
said well all you really have to do is

00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,690
just make braces and brackets the same

00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,059
color as your background and the third

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:26,260
thing is thing you're already done I can

00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:28,399
get mind Africa yeah yeah I think so

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,230
there's anyone else have anything any

00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,090
comments to make on on the neck of

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,720
question well I think I asked the

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:39,950
audience how many people would be in

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,929
favor of Topsy switching to switching

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:50,029
from braces to significant whitespace

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:53,450
raise your hands okay so that there are

00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:56,980
a few I would say that is between two

00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:01,809
and five percent how many people are

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:05,299
strongly against this proposal wait wait

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:08,730
so significant more strongly how many

00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:13,059
are against it at all

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,890
yeah and there's a question yellow might

00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:16,840
come though the Mighty Mite microphone

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:22,179
is on its way you can call me Diana

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:25,320
thank you the question there is of the

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,070
people that are strongly against

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,289
removing the braces

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:31,690
how many have used a significant

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:34,330
whitespace language because I know that

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,460
at least in my experience I was strongly

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:38,740
against it until I useful for a while

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,870
for more than five minutes for more than

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,850
a day where you were throwing chairs at

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,460
things and anybody around you so can I

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:48,039
can I ask you how long or how far into

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,350
your tree a tree footman maybe a week oh

00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,380
we all sweet him and you are more in

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,029
favor of well yeah yeah because it's

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,950
it's like one of those things that you

00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:59,080
have to experience is like sushi right

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,960
someone will tell it hey go and eat some

00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,580
kind of non made fish and in it what I

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,889
mean if you come from a culture that

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,360
never it's sushi at any weed and you're

00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:10,600
like oh my god this is amazing

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,000
I mean what I'm saying is like if you

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,090
have a strong against opinion on it

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,260
maybe you should try a significant white

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,700
plate language with for drawing

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:25,550
meditators okay yeah

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:29,420
[Applause]

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:31,910
and this was for you due to this an

00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,060
f-sharp is that correct yes so a shelf

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:37,640
of the language that had braces and

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:41,860
switched to significant white space to

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,860
save yeah no I've got it wrong okay

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,730
great for you yeah okay so I think I

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:53,600
think the point there is that before you

00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:56,540
before you sneer at this idea it's a

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,200
poetic isn't it for you for you sneer at

00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,630
this idea

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,760
try it try it out the PR the PR is still

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:06,710
open couldn't come people the branches

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,120
the branches the Lessing so you could

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:10,370
you could compile your own toffee and

00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,450
and let's give it a go could I ask you a

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,760
question of course

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,880
so how many people in the audience are

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,830
totally against any evolving of the

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:28,730
language how many people wanted that's a

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:30,020
neutral question expert you want to

00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,120
could could love a slightly different

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,260
question could we say how many people

00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:40,180
are against busy work style changes that

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:44,930
improve the syntax maybe just slightly

00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:47,450
neutral why - yeah that's really big it

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,810
is very very but let's just say this

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,050
plague if so our experience after this

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:57,380
whole the issue and the discussions has

00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:59,660
been that we realized that people need

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,450
the language to evolve at a slower pace

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,480
and preferably it should be able to be

00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:08,870
rewritable by politics let's sort of

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:13,580
suggest so Olaf which would you describe

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:16,550
Scala fix as an enabler for breaking

00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,590
changes in the language or an enabler

00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,430
for this discussion I think people are

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,570
just in some threads writing long essays

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,980
well we could just say okay we'll give

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,570
it a truck shot and then we can

00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,450
automatically switch you back and forth

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,100
and then we'll have Turkey could be way

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,470
more experience or

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,169
as SS was mentioned here from the

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,090
audience and I think we'll have a more

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,090
interesting discussion on what features

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,400
are important than what now okay so

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:48,080
anything that improves or like makes

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,010
people use graphics I'm happy I guess I

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,190
kind of want to say something a little

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,600
bit about Scala fix I I think um sort of

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:55,280
ways the way we've characterized John's

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,860
description made it sound like it's is

00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,450
just a tool that you can use to sort of

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,580
migrate between different language

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,370
versions or language dialects I think

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,960
that's true but I think I think all of

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,440
us actually should be taking a much much

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,940
closer look at Scala fix it is at least

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:18,080
when when the sort of semantic features

00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:19,130
become more more mature and quite a lot

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,740
of progress has been made on that

00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,990
recently at any rate I think we can

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:30,010
start seeing thinking of it as a general

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:32,120
tool for making interesting and useful

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:34,520
rewritings of scarlet code in general

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,080
and I've heard personally one of the

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,730
things I'm most looking forward to be

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,710
able to use it to do it's actually

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,780
migrate between versions of libraries or

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,770
or possibly even you know migrate

00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:49,039
between one library and some other

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:51,679
similarly some similar library I think

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:56,030
this has an enormous enormous prospect

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,320
of allowing us to actually evolve not

00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,510
not just the language but the entire

00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,490
ecosystem and a much more smooth and

00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,730
pleasant kind of way I mean you know

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:08,000
shakers 3 will arrive one day and and it

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,159
will be a the changes it represents will

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,049
be pretty big I would love to be able to

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,750
provide people with you know a scale of

00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:16,880
6 extension that they can use to kind of

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:20,570
rewrite their code I think everyone else

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,340
who actually is a library also probably

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,360
be taking a good closer look at sky

00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,360
effects as well

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,020
or just ship your library with some

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,320
recipes to check that it's being used

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:36,020
correctly or you know that code smells

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,690
that you recognize and ways to fix those

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:40,610
so maybe I can set one of the coolest

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,880
features I think that is quite easy to

00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:46,280
implement now would be let's say if you

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,890
rename a method because you started out

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,710
in your with a bad name and then you

00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:55,010
change the name it might be possible

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,530
actually just to say I'll use use this

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,930
name instead and from the deprecation

00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:03,050
warnings you could actually convert that

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:04,610
into this when so the users will just

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,820
pump up the version number they'll see

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,590
these deprecation warnings fix it

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,930
without any instructions about what to

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:15,230
fix it'll actually just look at the

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,180
messages and rename the year because

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,800
like that would I think would be pretty

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:23,150
cool and would be fairly simple to

00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,450
provide so this sounds like a happy

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:29,900
potential future utopia of instantly

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,000
migrating code could you also perhaps

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,770
have a scholar fix rest add enough

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,890
recipes approved terminology rewrite

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:40,520
rears rewrite where if you wanted to

00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,530
migrate say from scholars enter cats or

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,180
castor scholar said I won't suggest

00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,760
which of those is the correct direction

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:50,300
but maybe you want to go one way or the

00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,890
other could you you instantly move

00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,650
people off one library onto another and

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,450
could this get actually very competitive

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:59,210
yeah the ecosystem might become a lot

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:01,490
more hostile in the near future you can

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:06,620
walk more okay you can lose all of your

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:10,430
users in a day so let's say people have

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,680
been looking stuff yes okay so does

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:17,800
anybody have any questions from the

00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:20,450
audience please wave visit there is no I

00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,190
last time out in Chicago I said the

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:24,440
microphone is on its way and I got this

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,980
response back which was the microphones

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,650
called Diana so Diana is on the way and

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,810
the microphone is going out with the

00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,700
questioner but before I do I'd like to

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:37,019
say to the panel I'm going to ask you

00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,200
all the questions

00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:42,340
after this one which is always will be

00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,039
what is the most exciting thing you've

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,509
seen in Scala recently so think about

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,570
that and we'll go to the question over

00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:52,200
there right so my case question would be

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,989
out of all the features that were

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,470
introduced in type Levin scallop four

00:26:54,989 --> 00:27:02,470
which ones are likely to appear in their

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:10,600
scarlet color to one go twelve thirteen

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:12,700
to put twelve would version are we it's

00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,679
not addressed to me or to eighty it does

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,019
blow actually yeah I think it's this end

00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,759
of the table and well obviously I'd like

00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:20,139
to see more all arrived and actually

00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,059
that's not entirely true and I think the

00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:27,159
kind Paula mosses and stuff it's very

00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:30,489
much experimental is we Pascal what oh

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,109
man Jovian it was very much sort of an

00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:33,789
idea we we discussed we thought this

00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:37,269
would be an interesting things just how

00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:38,710
little of kind polymorphism do we can we

00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:40,869
add the language to be able to do

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,759
something interesting with and what we

00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,659
came up with could you just describe

00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:44,710
kind poly

00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:47,580
yes very briefly because I think a lot

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:51,009
of people won't so kind polymorphism is

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:55,419
basically a way of abstracting over

00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:59,230
types independently of their kind okay

00:27:55,419 --> 00:28:00,879
so the kind is essentially the arity of

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:05,109
a type constructor so a simple type like

00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:09,190
int kind star a type constructor like

00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:09,460
this a type constructor with one hole in

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,369
it

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,409
map is a type constructor with two holes

00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:16,239
in it at the moment there is literally

00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:21,029
no where in a scarlet program that you

00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:24,190
can write int and also write list or map

00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:26,980
so there has to be that you can't bind a

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,869
type variable with with all three of

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,309
those things there are various kinds of

00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:32,379
fiddly ways that you can you can work

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,029
around this with sort of overwritten

00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:35,739
you know duplicated methods in this kind

00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:37,509
of saying but it generates huge amounts

00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:40,300
of boilerplate so the minimal kind of

00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:43,600
thing we did pascal did in

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,060
in his feature which is inside that what

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,670
Scala is it just allow it you to be able

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,740
to specify that a client variable can be

00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:51,970
instantiated by type of any kind and we

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,040
did nothing else at all that's the

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,890
absolute minimum we did and we thought

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:57,940
that this would be an interesting

00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,280
starting place to sort of play around

00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,630
with and explore what just how much you

00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,890
can do with that and how much more you

00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:07,330
might need um I don't think Adrian is

00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,950
likely to merge this and I think it's

00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,650
probably not it wouldn't be a good idea

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:14,080
because it's definitely exploratory very

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,090
much experimental so the things that are

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,070
more likely are the things that either

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:20,560
already are kind of you know basically

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,890
they're things which like the indulgence

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:28,930
implicit stuff I'm going to do some more

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,490
work on by name implicit and something

00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,460
equivalent to shape this is lazy which

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,930
Martin has picked up for dotty and very

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,190
helpfully written written that's it for

00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:39,640
me so I don't have to do it which is

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:41,860
great so things things like that are

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,900
kinds of things for the going to go in I

00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,250
mean ideally ideally ideally everything

00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,770
that appears inside level scarlet will

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,080
get merged but there are some things

00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:53,020
which I think a more expense expense and

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,410
and further out than others which point

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:59,290
I think Adrian probably safer I don't

00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,790
really look okay I've just got something

00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:04,380
up on something you said there which you

00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:07,840
don't expect this to be merged into

00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:11,500
scaloppine proper is it not a

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,720
requirement that any any any any change

00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,150
to the type level compiler must have

00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,230
some likelihood of being merged uh some

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:23,260
likelihood okay I think about your

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,760
likelihood well I I don't I don't think

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,320
I don't think anything in the type of

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:32,320
compiler had a zero likelihood of

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:35,260
English so Haven would it would it not

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,450
be useful if I knew I wanted you want to

00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,980
do it is not a kind polymorphism it's

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,030
like dynamic counting or something like

00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,490
that it's like saying

00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,380
generics are like casting you know it's

00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,300
not but by the way I'm gonna watch the

00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,960
audience afterwards what they think yeah

00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,590
so well I don't know I think it's not

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,240
really I don't

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,820
spend the whole panel debating you know

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:57,159
this kind of stuff I'm happy with my

00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,169
pasta panel or half a half the audience

00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:00,970
doesn't order never use this feature

00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:03,370
probably more than well I really didn't

00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,950
like that yeah okay this is for library

00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:09,460
alpha and I think it is useful for

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,740
providing you know practical type class

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,340
instances across different era T's of

00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,080
type constructors but the cost currently

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:23,559
as proposed is basically to go back to

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:25,389
before we had a check so but yeah I I

00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,559
think these things these technical

00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:29,200
discussions are better had on the poorer

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,119
class I mean at the moment you can have

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,980
some sort of collection in the

00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:35,080
collections library and these will have

00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,940
a to method well to recive takes a

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,519
parameter and you can write to list you

00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,610
might to vector to seek but you can't

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,590
like to map you have to write map as

00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,049
what rather could not connect some type

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,269
of argument or so I think I think the

00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:51,039
kind polymorphism that is implemented

00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:54,149
inside level scarlet would actually have

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,440
dealt with that particular issue because

00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:58,720
one of the very few things you can do

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,399
with an any kind of type variable is you

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,070
can use it to index of type class so you

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,679
could have had a high class someone's to

00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,509
perform a conversion for a list or a map

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,619
or whatever so it would have done it

00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:11,619
would have done the trick in that case

00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:14,649
but it's wrong types at the kind level

00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:17,499
so it really is not also absolutely not

00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:21,009
is there a slip for this should there be

00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:24,159
and that's a long consolation

00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:26,980
now remember the momentary experiments

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,340
and and I don't think it's ready for

00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,269
what

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,590
so I have a question for the audience

00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:31,210
how many of you out there consider

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:39,039
yourself library authors and maintain

00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:41,619
errs all of you okay so what we said is

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,039
about ten percent maybe fewer do a bit

00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:47,080
less well how many of you would would

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,669
describe yourself as definitely not

00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,110
library authors Julius you're simply

00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:54,999
using other people's libraries in your

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:57,610
writing application code so that those

00:32:54,999 --> 00:33:00,009
those two don't add up to add up to 100

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:01,659
percent so there's a lot of people miss

00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,129
in the square in the middle who's that

00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:03,850
maybe do a little bit of library level

00:33:03,129 --> 00:33:07,370
words

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,110
yeah what we will to see and what was

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:10,700
intention for your questions well I

00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,840
think I think there's certain features

00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,220
that we talked about building into the

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,370
language that people talk about as being

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,080
useful for libraries authors and I think

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,179
one of the problems that I've seen a lot

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,249
with Scala is that people try to

00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,440
introspect into library code and they

00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:26,419
have no idea what it's doing and so it

00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,860
doesn't matter if your code of the types

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,570
of things that you're bringing into the

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,759
seats or your ear I don't think it

00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,039
should just be limited to people that

00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,019
you're designating as library authors I

00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:38,389
think that us is the community we want

00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:41,419
to be able to build and extend that code

00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:43,730
and making that make sense to everyone

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,559
and making them as features that we

00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,929
think everybody would use is probably

00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:49,999
where we should prioritize my opinion

00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:51,409
III agree with that and I think I think

00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:53,389
creatures of this sort they definitely

00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,369
need to be motivated i I think I think

00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:57,619
the kind polymers and what kind

00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:01,820
polymorphism ultimately can be justified

00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:05,179
but not on its current form and I I

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:09,560
think I think we should probably tell I

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:12,460
thought if anyone has any other

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:16,760
questions I make sure to you're right

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,990
okay well I ain't playin it yet it's

00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,730
powerful thinking about what's the most

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,460
exciting thing they've seen in Scala you

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,940
know that I'm oh yeah okay okay next

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,940
question

00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:30,490
well I wanted to return to the topic of

00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:33,349
significant weight space okay I'm next

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:36,290
question what were you using to confirm

00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:39,909
I can't see mercy mercy on me and I'm

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:44,149
preparing me tighten my I am sorry yeah

00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:46,460
I'm programming Python since 1996 and I

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,190
still haven't gotten used to significant

00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,419
white space and still causing breakage

00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,240
especially for the programs that I'm

00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:56,270
mixing up tubs and spices and there are

00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,040
such in fightin okay so the and then in

00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,319
golang there is absolutely no issue

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,599
because there is one true formatting

00:35:00,319 --> 00:35:05,630
style that's enforced on all the

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,960
programs and the question is do you

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,300
envision in scala and one through

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,310
formatting that there will be you know

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,180
used across all the programs like one

00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:18,910
official style with Scala SMT

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:21,010
we just everything will be formatted

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,650
missus one one just find a microphone

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:27,369
away I'm everyone - boo - one point for

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:33,369
my team to rule them all personally I

00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:35,710
love that I think Ola as in enabling

00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,599
their face one thing any one thing what

00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,349
would you think about this I can't help

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,670
but notice Martin out of the room no

00:35:40,349 --> 00:35:44,410
permission well here's the thing I think

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,780
when you when you're programming and

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,760
something like go you don't have to

00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,710
think about the syntax and you don't

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,270
have to think about those debates with

00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:55,050
your co-workers when you're getting a

00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,819
pull request yeah

00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,200
we mentioned go for like two seconds I

00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,720
already have to make that important to

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,099
Texaco I'd like to draw the audience's

00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,190
attention to the fact that Martin has

00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:11,290
just walked out you have a continued

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:12,910
discussion intentions go yes I think go

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,760
over when you take away some of these

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,990
other concerns from your code you can

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,579
start to think about the parts of your

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:20,050
programming that actually matter and

00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:22,270
then you're not doing those types of

00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,160
debates over pull requests about the

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:25,869
nitpicks over style and that kind of

00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
thing and that's that's where I really

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,650
enjoyed programming and go in production

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,869
because you started thinking about

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:33,819
things in other ways and you know you

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:35,829
create a flow request since Colin people

00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:37,630
have opinions about how to do things and

00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,670
I think that's a feature in a bucketful

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,230
language and we can debate that no no I

00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,670
mean yeah I mean totally agree

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,200
like I think that's one of the good

00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:46,240
things that they have to offer and I

00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,010
don't think we'll ever have like one

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,200
single style of Scylla coding but I

00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,460
think we should have like we officially

00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,589
recommended one and I think it's

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,089
something that is on us to do and we

00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:57,010
haven't done it and I mean we're aware

00:36:55,089 --> 00:36:58,450
that we we should have and something

00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,010
that you could configure with your team

00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,720
and set up a certain style which is

00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,380
already what you can do is solve call

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:08,109
format yeah I don't that topic though

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,609
I'm really happy to see that the SBT

00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,740
team decided to reform at their code

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:14,400
base with Scott haven't they it's kind

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,400
of hormuz sorry

00:37:14,529 --> 00:37:18,730
and we are having a very healthy

00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:21,369
dialogue about finding saint defaults

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:22,749
with settings so that and I think

00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:27,640
there's a lot of momentum in this

00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:32,559
direction so yeah it's hard to convince

00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,880
some people ok took Kelly I want to go

00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:38,410
back to something you said a couple of

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,390
minutes ago about use of libraries going

00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,670
in introspecting those libraries to work

00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,989
out how they how they work now a lot of

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,369
the libraries I write I think this is

00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:47,200
probably true of many of the libraries

00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:49,769
out there there is a lot of horrible

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,299
stuff hidden in those libraries that is

00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:54,849
is there because you don't want the

00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:58,450
users to see it it's it's hiding it's

00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:59,650
abstracting in a way that the details of

00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:04,029
how things work and they're often very

00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:06,579
ugly details do you think people were

00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:08,170
using those libraries should be

00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:10,210
encouraged to look at them or do you

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,640
think that we should be documenting them

00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:17,109
better as a way to avoid the need ever

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,999
arising to look at the ugly innards yeah

00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:21,730
I think a lot of the the reason that you

00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:22,539
or me I end up intersecting libraries is

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,999
because there's not sufficient

00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,650
documentation and how things work and so

00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:28,150
adding more documentation to your

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:29,680
libraries would be a huge first step I

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:33,069
think the ideal situation for any

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:36,430
library is I import it it works I don't

00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:38,680
have to do anything that's my dream

00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:40,599
future of any library but I think the

00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,769
situation's we start to introspect code

00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,109
is when you're getting into more gnarly

00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:47,619
problems so I do think that's more

00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:49,230
common in Scala than other languages see

00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:52,690
the implication maybe being that

00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:54,279
possibly it is yes but I also think that

00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,690
lack of documentation is the reason that

00:38:54,279 --> 00:38:59,529
you start to look at Ferris code and

00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:02,680
then you know generated facts and things

00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:06,009
like that would be a huge help okay so

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,009
why is scarless documentation so bad I

00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:13,349
mean going my own contributions movie

00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:13,349
well I Wi-Fi only challenges

00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:21,239
seriously though I think it's absolutely

00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:23,249
correct that's Kelly saying that we

00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,470
should do a better job at documenting

00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:29,279
our libraries and I think we've made

00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:31,319
huge leaps throughout the last one half

00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:35,700
years especially with SB team since you

00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:38,880
thought it since I started of course

00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:41,730
no but with SVT microsites etc I think

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,369
all the using Tut's to compile the

00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:46,589
examples etc the professor in the

00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:49,499
project by Rob Norris prototype level

00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:50,309
that will compile all the codes in your

00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:52,829
documentation

00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:54,900
so if scholar language changes you can

00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:56,970
recompile and check that your example

00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,869
fragments of code are still valid

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:03,779
exactly thanks John

00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:05,640
you're welcome yeah we have more

00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:08,489
audience questions yeah anyone we have a

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,539
couple more yeah somewhat suburban one

00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:16,410
question Oh Carla cheeks do you see it

00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:19,140
in future really fixing the code or just

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:22,410
migrating from one version of the

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:25,109
library to another for example IntelliJ

00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,230
IDEA can suggest you to replace for

00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:31,410
example Pitzer dot size greater than

00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:34,380
zero with exist methods on collection

00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:38,460
you see color fix really fixing this

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,049
issue automatically in future so we have

00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,900
all the infrastructure to do that and I

00:40:40,049 --> 00:40:44,430
think if someone is willing to put in

00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,769
the the hours I think we can integrate

00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:48,210
these with IDs as well so that you can

00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:51,329
get these inspections right in your

00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,160
editor and you can selectively apply

00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:59,309
them some parts of your code

00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:01,440
so click answer yes yes so I think we

00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:04,319
have time for one more question and the

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,660
panel will arms come I had a question oh

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,430
sorry sorry grant i'ma tell my hair too

00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,109
quick yeah totally everybody off mic

00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,999
okay go for it

00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:14,400
I know that every every scholar base I

00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:15,480
think you've you've come to you've asked

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,160
a question during the final panel

00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,920
typically yeah actually I have two short

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,160
ones

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,260
I hope so actually that was a really

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,690
great setup just a minute ago and I kind

00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,540
of missed the opportunity but oh well

00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,550
the first question is with like

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,980
following up on and I'm not going to go

00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,660
into that subject again but it's like

00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,940
following up on the discussion around

00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,010
the significant white space I think

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:45,190
there is obviously everyone's going to

00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:48,430
go hard but no I I think one thing that

00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:50,290
is very very clear about that is the

00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,970
discussion is not for the around

00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:55,120
significant white space per se it's

00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:57,070
around how opinionated Scala as a

00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,650
language and as a tooling ecosystem

00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:03,490
should be and I think that one of the

00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,960
one of the more kind of bigger shall we

00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,450
say selling points for a lot of the

00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,780
people coming into the community is that

00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:12,550
scallop tends to be not very opinionated

00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,380
if you look at very common libraries

00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:16,120
like Scala tests and specs do you

00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,310
actually have like five different styles

00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,380
of building your tests and a lot of

00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:22,210
people actually see that including

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,290
myself by the way is a good thing so I'm

00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:29,440
just kind of wondering like as six kind

00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:31,180
of prominent personalities and the skull

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,790
community and authors of a lot of the

00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,200
tools that we used

00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:37,240
well Kelly sort of answered that but the

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,390
residue you feel that scholar should be

00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:44,490
more opinionated than it is than it

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:47,050
currently is with respect to style and

00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:48,790
generally on the spectrum of do whatever

00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:51,730
you want we support everything versus

00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:53,650
there is one true way like go of doing

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:58,960
things but that was a short question I

00:42:53,650 --> 00:43:01,060
think oh I hope it the title thinks it's

00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,620
a good question I would agree who would

00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,910
like to take that one

00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:07,330
Adrian I'll try to make my answer

00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:11,440
shorter than your question yes sorry no

00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:12,640
no no I think if I well I think you know

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,850
scale the language can remain flexible

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,040
while having a clear opinion on how

00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:19,510
you're supposed to use it like

00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,100
electricity is really flexible you know

00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,440
you're free to stick your fingers in the

00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,120
socket and electrocute your staff but as

00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,290
a society we figured out that's probably

00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,970
not a good thing to do and some people

00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,190
invest in things to plug into the socket

00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,480
so you can't good vegetable though so

00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,130
you can't do that right and

00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,560
and I think that's kind of the stuff

00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:42,460
that Scala FM format thing is for right

00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,440
is that and as a community forming the

00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:47,619
basis for for what Scala stands for or

00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,210
how we recommend you use Scala as is

00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:50,920
important I think that's that that's

00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,430
really something that I think because

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,510
God so flexible is even more necessary

00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,100
the other languages are kind of

00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:00,640
opinionated by default because they just

00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,770
don't support that flexibility but so

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,260
yeah I think it sort it's not because

00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:06,850
it's flexible that you can't be very

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,220
opinionated on how your team uses it

00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,630
right now and there that might change

00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,300
over time that might be different for

00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,800
different teams the teams but we should

00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,619
give you the tools to enforce what you

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,990
think is good and I feel like we have

00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:22,660
kind of maybe let you down a little bit

00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:25,030
that we don't have a good recommend that

00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:28,990
maybe like default probably fits most

00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:30,609
people style yeah I think the other

00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,470
thing to consider is now that skal has

00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:33,700
gained a lot more popularity you have

00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,500
more and more people that are not

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,180
choosing to come in to Scala but maybe

00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,160
get a job and now they're writing Scala

00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,380
and they just want to know what to do to

00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,680
get their job done and so without these

00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,150
kind of opinionated standards I think

00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,100
there's a lot of people out there that

00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:50,020
appreciate the flexibility but a lot of

00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,820
people that want to be told what to do

00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,190
so that they can go on and like do other

00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,500
things that they need to do in their job

00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,730
so Scott also has a lot of opinionated

00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,060
programmers and often these opinions

00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:03,910
clash in particular with with things

00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,369
like how you format your code do you

00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,109
think I mean I'm going to suggest the

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:09,910
answer but you think a lot of a pity

00:45:08,109 --> 00:45:13,510
these programs will be more flexible in

00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:16,119
in their opinions otherwise I mean this

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,609
is going to be a class I think someone

00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,290
like Adrienne's team or the Scala Center

00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:23,710
someone needs to decide what they think

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,490
and offer a suggestion and then we'll go

00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,590
from there

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,690
so if different coding standards

00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,040
guidelines for people I mean it's always

00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,680
going to come back down to what your

00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,900
team wants to do and so if we can as a

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,609
community and it's easier said than done

00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:37,400
as the community come up with our agreed

00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,660
standards

00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,290
you know sounds like a five-year project

00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,970
to me but you know you're gonna have a

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,890
lot easier time coming up with that on

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,330
your individual team in the debate in

00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:48,890
the domain that you know what you're

00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,780
going to need to do the people that you

00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:52,580
know how you're going to be programming

00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,850
with okay

00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:58,010
that's also one of the fallacies with

00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:00,440
Scala right you can keep iterating on

00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:02,480
the same problem again again and again

00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,300
you can keep rewriting things in a way

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,310
that's more fun right and I think we all

00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:10,190
do this as a dog said in his talk

00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:12,980
earlier and the key is not to get stuck

00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:16,880
there and one of the things from Olaf

00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,470
thesis which he quoted was can't

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,090
remember who it was but he says

00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:22,580
basically what the guy is saying is

00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,400
that's the any style guide that's all

00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,980
encompassing is too long and anything

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:31,450
else that's shorter is just not enough

00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:33,440
something yes it's ambiguous okay so

00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:38,930
maybe you get the last word on the

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:42,830
question yeah III guess III have a

00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:45,260
slightly different view on this I kind

00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:47,390
of think that the straight answer to the

00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,920
question is should the question being

00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:54,380
should scale to be more opinionated or

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:57,170
not is maybe it depends and I think

00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,520
that's right so I think I think there is

00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,170
that there are some places where where

00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,790
where opinions matter and some places

00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,860
where opinions you know they're not very

00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:05,630
important my personal view is that

00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,980
certainly ask are the current years

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,830
without significant white space for

00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,390
example people have lots of choices

00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:16,190
about how they lay out their code and I

00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:18,080
think I think that within within you

00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:19,610
know a group of people working together

00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,680
on a piece of code I think it's good

00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:24,110
that the Scarlet programming language

00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,870
supports many different styles and I

00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:28,340
also think it's great if we have tools

00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,780
which make it straightforward to

00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,280
translate between those styles and I

00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:36,800
think things like Scala fix actually are

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:39,100
enormous ly supportive of us having what

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,780
about that ball format it's got a thick

00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,160
beginning well for one I think I meant

00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,310
to go the format

00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,320
anyway I'm harder didn't open so I think

00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:50,600
I think I think I think having having

00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,210
tools which allows if you like abstract

00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,210
innocent over over things which are are

00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:59,690
differentially relevant depending on who

00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,390
you are and where you are and what what

00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:03,410
context is I think that's great

00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:06,830
on the other hand with some things which

00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:11,660
I think are more important than that I

00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:13,090
think we should for example be even more

00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:15,260
opinionated than we are about null

00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:17,090
currently it would be great if we were

00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:18,940
to actually eliminate null from the

00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:21,680
language entirely and that is very much

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,990
expressing an opinion it wouldn't it

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,860
wouldn't it be nice if it could be just

00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:30,110
expressed as a union code ah

00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,690
saying daddy absolutely that's right but

00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:35,810
is this is work in progress it's not

00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:39,320
that yet and so I think I think the

00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:41,570
particular feature is in da C Union

00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:44,090
types are in brilliant sites are part

00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:46,430
but there's no like not having knowledge

00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:49,040
before well I don't think I say not yes

00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:52,580
like that's a lot of it but I mean my

00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,230
point here is not it's not scripts like

00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,460
that that's a good thing that's that's

00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,560
actually do the language being more

00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:59,570
opinionated about something which really

00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,740
matters so I I kind of think it's

00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,910
contextual it depends on what we're

00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,080
talking about and that's an example

00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,120
where I would like to be more

00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,910
opinionated there are the plenty of

00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,740
other places where actually I think it's

00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,960
great to let let's let things be

00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,150
different okay thank you miles that was

00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:15,980
the last word on that that topic I think

00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:18,920
Tom oh can I answer when a scratch on

00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:21,470
everything timed out John can answer

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,600
quickly though you wanted a last laugh

00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,600
for it yeah Coleman you've got ten

00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,400
seconds iris yeah so but I think yes and

00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:31,070
I think we can get towards to really and

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,300
put you know figure out the trivia for

00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:34,640
us so that we can really focus on the

00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,910
apps where like the ends rather than the

00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,540
means okay thank you

00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:44,150
Alessa so I asked panel one question

00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,740
earlier to all of them which is what is

00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:48,680
the most exciting thing you've seen in

00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:51,440
scala recently

00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:54,340
Oh laughs can we start from the other

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,340
side yeah maybe

00:49:55,789 --> 00:49:59,749
I don't want the implication to be can I

00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:02,359
talk about some like space or I mean

00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:04,640
maybe it's my space most exciting thing

00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:07,249
you say well I can't answer that but I

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:10,849
am excited about working on the repple

00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:13,579
for 213 so this big big improvements

00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:16,279
plan for that well not not a huge one

00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:17,660
okay but enough space I think yeah I

00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:23,029
think exciting ones yeah

00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:26,059
miles look quite there yet but it's very

00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:28,970
very close cat Wanda oh and cats effects

00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:30,769
I think it's been really really exciting

00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:34,069
over the last couple years

00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:39,710
seeing how cats taken off for how people

00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:43,150
are contributing to it using it and the

00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:46,640
fact that we are now weeks away from a

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,619
first milestone release of one zero I

00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,630
think is brilliant and I think I think

00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:52,420
the cats are tech stuff if you like the

00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:54,680
last missing piece of picture which is

00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,359
kind of holding people back from from

00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,130
adopting at that stats also coming

00:50:56,359 --> 00:51:00,680
together now so that to me I think is

00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:03,890
kind of like a cat's cats one Felix

00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:06,619
right so the thing that's I've been

00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:10,549
noticing this past year and a half is

00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:12,410
that we've been giving more space to our

00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:15,019
speakers have chosen to speak about more

00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,609
pragmatic solutions to problems for

00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:19,700
instance like dogs how to run a company

00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:21,440
on Scala and Kelly on both the monads

00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,869
and functional programming today and I

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,279
think hearing these voices in our

00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:27,980
community is something that's really

00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:30,400
important when we have a large community

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,890
that chooses different styles of scope

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,180
okay thank you Kelly

00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:37,720
I'm really excited about some of the

00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:40,940
user friendliness initiatives that is

00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:43,160
prioritized for 2:13 and hopefully we'll

00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,499
see some of the back ported stuffy Felix

00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,640
is showing in a stock yesterday so I

00:51:45,499 --> 00:51:49,099
know you're already working on the

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,150
repple I have semi volunteered to help

00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:54,289
out with the dogs and the error messages

00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:57,829
Kelly will be helping out with the dog

00:51:54,289 --> 00:52:00,710
yeah and they're going yeah everything

00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:04,250
else is going to be my job right

00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:06,410
I did not volunteer awesome and finally

00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:08,690
because we didn't want to first hola

00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,030
it's better be good yeah I'm most

00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,849
excited about SBT 1.0 I think it's going

00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:15,410
to be a huge enabler for tooling and

00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:17,599
they just had a milestone 6 release now

00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:20,030
this week and I really want to encourage

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,849
everyone to give it a try see what

00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:25,400
plugins are missing etc because it's a

00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:27,589
going to be huge for tooling like it's

00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,470
going to be really really good so if the

00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:32,300
is that exciting because it's it's

00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,240
finally got the significant version

00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,829
number all because of those new features

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,839
so you raise the credit to me we don't

00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:41,359
have in the new features we don't have

00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:44,930
nasarah 13 I love I think we spend a lot

00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:48,500
of time dealing with builds and longer

00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:52,369
than we would like I'm saying yeah and I

00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:54,800
have wasted a sad amount of time for the

00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:57,349
past year getting over class loading

00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,559
issues because SBT is on to point them

00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:03,470
and I'm really excited to be able to use

00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,359
color format for example inside the

00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:08,000
bills without doing evil class loading

00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:10,960
stuff so that's why I'm really excited

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,450
about it so we can we can finally drop

00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,040
scarlet c10 force

00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:21,740
I'm really happy yeah awesome awesome so

00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,990
all the remains me to say thank you to

00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,760
you as the audience your your questions

00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:29,569
your your patience listen to lots of

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:33,079
comments about white space thank you to

00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:36,010
the panel I'll ask Kirsten with the

00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:41,480
right this time Clos close first grid

00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:45,670
