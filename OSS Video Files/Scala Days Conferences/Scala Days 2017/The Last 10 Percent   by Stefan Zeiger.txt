Abstract: 
Have you learned Scala and just created your first Scala library (or would you like to)? How do you continue when you are finished writing the code and it does what it is supposed to do? The only remaining obstacle is to get it into the hands of others, but the technical details involved in this can be overwhelming the first time. Where do you publish it, and how? What about tests, test infrastructure, documentation, licensing, versioning, releasing? How do you perform these steps manually? Can you automate them? In this session we will look at and perform live all the necessary steps to take your code from a bunch of Scala source files to an open source Scala project.
