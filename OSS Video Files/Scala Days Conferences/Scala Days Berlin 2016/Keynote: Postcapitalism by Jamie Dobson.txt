Abstract:
This talk is about how software, particularly open-source software, is not only eating the world but eating capitalism itself - from the inside out.

Last summer I read Paul Mason's Postcapitalism and thereafter Rifkin's The Zero Marginal Cost Society. As I did this, and made notes, I came to see that our own open sourced products, such as Mini-Mesos and our ElasticSearch Framework, were threatening to disrupt our commercial competitors.

After thinking more about this, it's very obvious to see that open source software, and for example 3-D printing, is not only disrupting how we build things but is also undermining the core relationships of capitalism. If the marginal cost of a unit is free and so is its price, then there cannot be any profit. This one relationship undermines the very foundation of capitalism - something that Marx predicted.

This talk will look at capitalism, post capitalism, and as a case study will look at our ElasticSearch framework for Mesos. I will give insights into how companies can still stay relevant even when software is free - and I will do this by looking at how windmills utterly disrupted landowners in 11th century Yorkshire.

	00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,460
ok so we're going to be talking about

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,150
today before we do that a very short

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,400
introduction my name is Jamie Dobson I

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,160
work for a company called container

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,110
solutions katina solutions have got

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,390
offices in Amsterdam where the company

00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:29,300
started but also in London Zurich

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:33,140
Copenhagen and Scotland and what we're

00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,579
trying to do is sort of automate nearly

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,950
all the wag flow around infrastructure

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,680
data centers and even application

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,620
delivery if we succeed in this mission

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,700
there'll be less and less people

00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,160
involved in the deployment of

00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,640
applications and the management of data

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,010
centers so I don't know what it's like

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,590
in Germany but in the Netherlands where

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,500
I was living last year with my my wife

00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,350
and my kids I've been there for 16 years

00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,270
and it was summertime and I was sort of

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,759
bored because in the Netherlands

00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:08,720
everybody goes on holiday in summer is

00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:10,670
that the same in Germany and so I was

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,070
SAT there and I started to think how can

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,130
we make money with open source software

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,859
and I started to ponder what happens if

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,439
we keep going with this path to

00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,850
automation how are we going to make any

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,670
money what's the world going to look

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,189
like and it turns out surprise surprise

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,889
I'm not the first person to have asked

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:34,100
these questions and what I'd

00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:36,109
accidentally done was stumble upon one

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,679
of cow Marx's contradictions of

00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:42,109
capitalism and Cal Max had said if we

00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:45,020
keep going with innovation and increases

00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:47,240
in productivity we will not need any

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,369
workers and if there's nobody working

00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,119
then there's nobody earning wages and

00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:57,289
therefore capitalism will collapse okay

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,539
I thought sounds interesting so I did

00:01:57,289 --> 00:02:02,029
what everybody does when they discover

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:05,689
something like this I went onto amazon

00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:07,909
and i started typing things in and i

00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:10,369
discovered initially this book called

00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:12,470
post capitalism by paul mason he's a

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,080
journalist and i read it and i

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,209
thoroughly enjoyed it then i discovered

00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,210
a book called the zero marginal cost

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,640
society and finally I came across this

00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,540
book inventing the future by Alex and

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,329
Nick

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,040
him and I read these books and I was

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:29,689
sort of just working through my notes I

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,849
was at a conference and somebody got

00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:33,109
sick and they said hey can you speak and

00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,400
I said well I can't speak because I've

00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,920
got nothing prepared I've just got this

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,260
paper and a whiteboard pen and they said

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,629
speak anyway so I spoke out go to

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,489
Copenhagen about this stuff got a good

00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,650
reaction from the audience ended up

00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,989
speaking about it at oscon in Texas a

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,150
few weeks ago I was really scared about

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,470
that because you know in 10 in Texas

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:56,090
you're allowed to carry concealed

00:02:51,470 --> 00:03:00,250
weapons and when people here post

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:06,319
capitalism they hear socialist scumbag

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:08,900
and I'm like I'm dead anyway I

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,510
survived I survived Texas and I survived

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:15,470
oscon and I bumped into a load of very

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,900
am one second very friendly people there

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,489
that were very supportive so the story

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,989
of this story is the story of these

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:22,879
books and I must give a big thank you to

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,159
all these authors and especially Paul

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,049
who actually answered my messages on

00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,060
their Twitter and actually helped me

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,709
form this story if you're interested in

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,629
these books you can of course get them

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,030
if you really want a german copy of

00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:38,750
paul's book you can buy it now it's

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:43,310
called post capitalism us that's that is

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,629
German right yeah okay thank you so go

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,229
ahead by those books they're excellent

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:51,049
books at all these people on Twitter and

00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,639
you know good luck with that so the

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,650
things I want to talk to about today I

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,780
want to talk about three things so the

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,900
first thing is transitions economic and

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,190
political transitions we often when

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,799
we're caught in a big system whether

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,889
it's a political system or a system of

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,930
work we think there is no other way of

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,329
doing things or being organized and

00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,459
that's because things change slowly so

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,169
we don't actually notice them it can

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,599
sort of lead to a bit of nihilism to be

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:21,049
honest but we all know that capitalism

00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:22,610
is actually a very new idea and the

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,610
other thing I like to tell people is

00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,990
anybody who's my age and older has

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,360
actually lived through one of the

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,820
greatest transitions in like the history

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,490
of economics and that was the that was

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,070
the transition from Keynesian economics

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,080
to the neoliberal model and frame

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,960
that we couldn't live currently live

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,600
with it the second thing I want to talk

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,220
about is these contradictions these

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,350
marks in contradictions because they

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,080
will give us insight into how a system

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,330
not just capitalism but how every system

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,280
sort of contains the seeds of its own

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,290
destruction I'll talk about three of

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,240
them and the last one is going to be

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,880
about the thing I discovered last summer

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,740
which is that if we succeed with extreme

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,420
productivity there'll be nothing left

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,480
that we're not normal work for any of us

00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:11,120
to do the third thing I want to do is

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,460
try to answer the question are we there

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,230
yet so I was in the in a restaurant last

00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,240
night with a bunch of lovely people and

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,010
one person said to they are this talk

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,350
about the end of whack we've been saying

00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:27,410
this since the 1950s and I'm like yeah

00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:29,120
but this time it's different so I'd like

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,530
to try to answer that question and

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,300
obviously at the end I'll take questions

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,890
and comments from people because I'm

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,760
also really interested in seeking your

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:39,830
seeking your input so our story begins

00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,170
the story of transitions begins like

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,530
many stories in the Swiss Alps in the

00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,590
1940s a man called Hayek gathered

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,090
together with a number of other

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,540
economists and they started what became

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:55,880
the mont pelerin society they were bunch

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,250
of academics and what they thought was

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,980
that they needed an alternative to

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,320
kenzie nism so Keynes was all about

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,480
regulating the market it's a very simple

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,210
idea when you have high economic growth

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,590
you should tax more we take the tax

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,470
revenues and you put it in a war chest

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,110
and then during a recession you spend

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,050
the money so Keynes believed in markets

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,270
but he believed in regulated markets the

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,450
neoliberals of the time believed in

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,670
unregulated markets they said if we

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,710
leave the markets to themselves they

00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,290
will self-correct and we'll have a more

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,220
efficient and prosperous economic

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:36,440
situation unfortunately Hayek and his

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,900
colleagues didn't get very far because

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,570
keynes ian is a harbor it's actually

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,600
difficult letter Keynesian economics was

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:47,350
so successful that it didn't seem to be

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,840
there was no need for it to be replaced

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,960
the second wave of neoliberal sled by

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,540
Friedman in the 1950s and 60s worked

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,060
very hard to build think tanks take air

00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,240
positions in universities and yet they

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,470
still gained no traction but Friedman

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,840
made a very interesting observation in

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,390
1962 and he said change will only come

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,360
about with a crisis or a perceived

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,270
crisis and the job of the radicals is

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,170
not to force the crisis but to be ready

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,880
with ideas so when the crisis hits you

00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:25,390
can take your ideas and make them

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,580
mainstream the crisis did here in the

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,220
1970s when we had something we'd never

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,300
seen before high inflation and low

00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:36,760
growth which is also known as stagnation

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,290
nowadays we call this stagflation but

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,330
back in the 70s they couldn't name it

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,580
and they didn't know what it was and so

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,890
for the first time keynesianism started

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,370
to wobble the neoliberal were on hand

00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,790
with an alternative Friedman went from

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,020
being in the fringes in the 60s to

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,480
advising Margaret Thatcher in the united

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,520
kingdom ronald reagan in the united

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,330
states you've probably all heard of

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,300
reaganomics is there anybody here older

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,890
than me yeah yeah to Janet to brave

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,120
gentleman here yeah okay so there's four

00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:12,100
people older than me okay that's good

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,440
reaganomics and so neoliberalism got a

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,590
true foothold in our economic framework

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,300
now we think of neoliberalism has been

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,910
the property of the right of the

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,970
political spectrum and yet after reagan

00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,530
and george bush came clinton and and

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,810
over in the united kingdom we got tony

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,500
blair left-wing politicians and yet they

00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,270
kept going with the neoliberal framework

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,530
unregulated markets financial and

00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:40,210
housing etc etc that's how you know

00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,160
you're in an ideology because

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,380
everybody's doing it this belongs now

00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:49,150
there to the left or to the right it

00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:51,040
actually belongs to all of us and all of

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,440
you were a ver around when this

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,140
transition began or you've been living

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,320
in it as children teenagers and now

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:03,120
young adults so transitions canna care

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,120
but you don't always see that

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,709
so what are these contradictions then

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:12,170
that captured my imagination so much

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,879
last year so I'm going to focus on three

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:16,069
of them depending on who you speak to

00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,110
there's a guy called Dave Harvey out of

00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:20,060
England reckons the 17 contradictions

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,670
that will kill capitalism I don't have

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,540
time for them today we'll focus on three

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:31,699
so the first contradiction is that

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,800
capital tends to get up and leave so you

00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:36,860
you have a really interesting dynamic

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,860
where for some reason you find a natural

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,410
resource or by chance there's a human

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,060
resource and around this we start to

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,579
build infrastructure companies

00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,230
universities the better the university's

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,050
the better the companies perform it

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,139
attract more people to the area and so

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,839
you have a sort of economic gravity very

00:09:54,139 --> 00:10:00,649
famous clusters would be parts of Italy

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,839
and the silk trade a Detroit Michigan

00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:04,910
for the automobile industry and of

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,899
course our friends over in Silicon

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,339
Valley what happens is as this gravity

00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:14,529
gets stronger and stronger and stronger

00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:17,990
we attract more talented engineers

00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:19,399
factory manufacturers and we have to pay

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,709
them how your wages so things become

00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,500
increasingly competitive at the same

00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:26,899
time this force is an upward pressure on

00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:30,860
wages and of course forces a downward

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:33,139
pressure on profit the landlord in the

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,839
areas of these clusters can now ask

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,569
higher rents higher sales of houses and

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,879
so although there can be millions or

00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,949
sometimes billions of dollars

00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,899
concentrated in an area it might

00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:48,230
actually be impossible to make a profit

00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,269
there we have seen people leaving San

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,199
Francisco because it's impossible to run

00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:55,939
profitable businesses there so the whole

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,910
point of capitalism is to create profit

00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,980
so if you get a situation like that

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,779
capitalism is not necessarily

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,809
nationalistic it's not sentimental it

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,699
just gets up and goes somewhere else it

00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:10,759
will find a location where it can be

00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:13,819
deployed more effectively at creating

00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,360
profits these transitions if you stop

00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,480
for a sec

00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,450
and all around us anybody know where

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,510
this is they try of course yeah I did

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,070
this in America Devils like Detroit that

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,290
yeah okay okay okay I'm not going to

00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,970
pick on Detroit too much Detroit was of

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,190
course a famous cluster for

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:33,709
manufacturing of automobiles and the

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,220
common story is that capital picked up

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:39,230
and it went offshore two parts of Asia

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,079
this is the normal narrative actually

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,940
what happened is at least partially

00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,589
capital went to Tennessee it didn't

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,570
leave the United States so some of the

00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:50,570
manufacturing actually stayed within the

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:53,510
borders so the boom in Tennessee came at

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,839
a cost to Detroit as I said capital

00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:01,880
isn't sentimental now I know that nobody

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,990
here knows where this is do you a man is

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,200
Bruce Willis hair I thought he was

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,630
putting his hand up this is hole in East

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,980
Yorkshire in England and I know a little

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,820
bit about hole because it's where I'm

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,779
from this is the Lord line trailer

00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,600
controlling company was a fishing

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,180
company during the 1970s and please

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,360
don't laugh we lost what was known as

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:25,370
the cod war not the Cold War the Cold

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,550
War we lost the first Cold War and then

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,959
we lost the second Cold War and it was a

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,149
dispute over fishing quotas between

00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,610
other members of the European Union and

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,890
our quarters were cooked dramatically

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,070
what that men from a capital perspective

00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,990
was that you couldn't ring the same

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,720
efficiencies out in whole as you could

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,399
in these other places capitalism didn't

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,620
care about the 300-year history of

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,680
fishing in my hometown no it just got up

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:56,240
and it just left so I was actually born

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,690
into a d industrialized city and this is

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,310
a factory further down son Andrews key

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,949
this is on the outer rings of the city

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,440
center so the deindustrialization and

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:09,790
the decay spreads from the source to all

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,560
the xhilaration 'he's pubs restaurants

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,630
housing this pub has been like this for

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,350
five years we actually can't even afford

00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,029
to not these places down and many people

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,790
get very excited about creative

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:25,819
destruction those people usually haven't

00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,670
seen the destruction it does change your

00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:30,520
perspective when you've seen this

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:34,350
first hand so capital tends to get up

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,340
and leave get tends to get up and leave

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,040
this is this creates a sort of

00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,470
geographical inequality so some people

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,470
win some locations win at the cost of

00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,580
others Tennessee Detroit Iceland East

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:51,130
Yorkshire etc etc it also creates

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,080
inequality directly many people know

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,620
that capital and inequality go together

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,140
but we don't always know how when you

00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,090
have an object an item this clicker the

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,090
car you drive the house you live in it

00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,800
has a use value and the use value is

00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:08,740
what you get from it if it's a house

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,200
it's somewhere to be to sleep in a place

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,600
of safety somewhere you can spend time

00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,970
with your children a three-bedroom house

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,330
in London will cost you about two

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,820
million pounds so we we know for sure

00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,170
that the use value of that house is not

00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,610
two million pounds I mean it's worth

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,190
something but it's not worth two

00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,650
millions on things the two million price

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,660
tag is actually the exchange value

00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:36,490
that's what you can get for it on an

00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,740
open market so we now use houses for

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,010
safety and for comfort but also as

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,290
assets assets that we speculate with at

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,510
the height of a speculative bubble the

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,150
first people start to exit and they make

00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:51,520
big money the next people exit and they

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,160
make big money then the market realizes

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,880
and everybody dumps their assets most

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,520
people on the downswing lose more than

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:04,690
they went in with so by definition you

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,880
create an in equal situation people talk

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,060
about the Golden Age of capitalism in

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,860
the post-war era I like to remind them

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,140
that Golden Age of growth and economic

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,120
success came at the cost of the

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,910
exclusion to fifty percent of our

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,400
population namely women and minorities

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:23,110
so the golden years after the war was

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,020
some of the darkest years for human

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:28,840
rights in the last century the 1970s

00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,550
which was crap for economics was

00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,530
actually very good if you were feminist

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:35,350
because we made great grounds during

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,510
those years so even even the brightest

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:41,430
moments in capitals history are actually

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,430
marred by systemic inequality

00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,810
now this is where we get to the world

00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,220
that we occupy the world of technology I

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,800
want to read out a short passage from

00:15:50,220 --> 00:16:00,450
this book this is from Rifkin because he

00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:02,300
explains this dynamic very well so we

00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,010
come face to face with the ultimate

00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,620
contradiction at the heart of capitalism

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:10,380
the driving force of the system is

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,870
greater productivity brought on by

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,880
increase in thermodynamic efficiencies

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:18,990
if you don't know what that means don't

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,060
worry neither do i the process is

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,950
inspiring as competitors raise to

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,320
introduce new more productive

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,820
technologies that will lower their costs

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,520
and the price of their products and

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,770
services to luring buyers this risk

00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,630
continues to pick up momentum until it

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,460
approaches the finish line where the

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:39,210
optimum efficiency is reached and

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,890
productivity Peaks that finish line is

00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,880
where the marginal cost of producing

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:47,160
each unit is almost zero when the finish

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,980
line is crossed goods and services

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,470
become nearly free profits dry up the

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:58,140
exchange of property market shut down

00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:00,960
and the capitalist system dies so what

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,000
are marginal costs well if you have your

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,520
fixed cost is a very simple formula the

00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,850
revenue you make manager costs equals

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,260
profit two types of costs fixed costs

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,079
like the rent of a building like this

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:16,560
they don't change no matter how much or

00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,980
how little you produce marginal costs

00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,079
are about the additional costs per unit

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,480
so if you create a new car there's the

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,780
labor to put it together the steel and

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,660
the materials and the energy so clearly

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:34,200
one way to increase profit is to drive

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,600
down your marginal costs typically one

00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,210
area of that is to attack labor either

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,540
to attack unionized labor or simply to

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,880
automate it away clearly as marginal

00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:49,610
costs head toward zero profits will go

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,610
up but nobody is then getting

00:17:52,220 --> 00:18:02,009
yes okay so i've requested about this

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,600
year for the model so nobody else will

00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:09,799
understand that can you just hold that

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:15,240
question till the end yeah thanks and so

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:22,919
where was I hey where was I yeah before

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:25,169
that yes so that yes thank you sir so so

00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,940
as we tend toward zero marginal costs of

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:29,100
course the wage bill become 0 and then

00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:37,799
who is left to buy these products and

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:41,070
services that's the real issue so yeah

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:45,840
yeah there is two magical crossed sand

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:47,519
crappy products Oh hold on not only if

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,950
you have you derailed my talk you've

00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:59,730
broken the computer how did you do that

00:18:49,950 --> 00:19:02,429
right okay it's anybody help me should i

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:08,999
restart it did Microsoft not just buy

00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:14,970
shares in apple recently okay oh we're

00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:16,379
back go back ah ok so the question I

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,919
think that's very interesting to try to

00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:23,129
answer apart from that question is are

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,940
we there yet so the first thing I

00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:29,070
discovered about this marginal cost

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,190
nonsense was 3d printed and for a very

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:35,159
long time I rejected 3d printed as some

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,440
sort of fat all I'd ever seen was people

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:39,749
model their faces and heads and print

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,970
out really poor versions of it and I

00:19:39,749 --> 00:19:43,919
like how much did this thing cost you

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,100
it's like a thousand euros I like what

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,629
to pretty effects and I know we live in

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,629
the age of narcissism but this was

00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:54,299
getting ridiculous so I just kept

00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:56,429
dismissing 3d printers out of hand now

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:59,309
everybody knows that container solutions

00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:01,830
that onto a very good idea when I say it

00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:03,279
 right so like let's keep going

00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,049
because Jamie hates it

00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:09,230
and this is how you know that's how we

00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:11,779
sort of manage our innovation process 3d

00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,250
printing came to me through a friend a

00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:16,370
friend of mine called Anthony Anthony

00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:19,100
Smith he is a keen cyclist but he's also

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,899
a physical designer he builds products

00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,169
that you can actually touch unlike any

00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:26,539
of like oz law he went on to England he

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:28,190
met his dad and his dad's mudguard had

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,169
broken you know this thing goes on the

00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,840
bike and it stops you getting mud on you

00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,460
on your leg it was just one piece at the

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,380
front so they went to the bike store and

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:39,769
I said hey we need this this piece for

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,200
this erm for this machine for the bike

00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:44,870
said oh well you can't buy it separately

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,240
you can only buy the whole thing in its

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,610
25 pound so of course they were miffed

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,620
right the like we don't want to pay 25

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,870
pound for this little thing so Anthony

00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,840
goes home he models it as best he can

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,909
using his skills as a physical engineer

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,019
and then he then he prints it but of

00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:02,149
course it doesn't come out straight away

00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:03,769
because 3d printers take ages so he goes

00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:07,669
to the pub gets drunk and then when it

00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:09,289
returns it's like half done oh okay so

00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,840
they have to wait till breakfast before

00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:14,000
they can attach it to the bike this is a

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,380
good story because he's disrupted the

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,090
revenue stream of the people who

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,250
produced that widget but he's not

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,880
disrupted it very much right but the

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:26,950
next thing he does is uploaded to a

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,679
fanzine of 3d modeling enthusiastic

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,870
cyclists and they produce things like

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,149
this all the time so there's a whole

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:38,529
cottage industry of people printing

00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:42,740
widgets that's currently disrupting the

00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:44,120
cycle industry okay right so on this is

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,740
not going to change the world this is

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:52,669
not going to make us all unemployed

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:55,010
until I found this a house a 3d printer

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:58,909
that prints houses and I was like what

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,639
the other as a I thought they were

00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:03,529
only this big right I had this read

00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:05,809
fantasy I was half asleep and I had this

00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:07,340
fantasy that i bought a 3d printer and I

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,140
went to work and when I came back there

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:13,710
was two of them right

00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,390
and and then when I came back the next

00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,430
day there was two of them and two small

00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:20,910
ones and I think guys you've got to stop

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,710
printing yourself and so to my amazement

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,110
I went from understanding these small

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,910
machines to discovering that and then of

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,010
course I found out there's a whole range

00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:32,210
of 3d printers all in different sizes

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:35,250
from the very small to the very very big

00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,430
this has serious implications for

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:44,190
manufacturing as anybody heard of the

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:48,150
term reshoring reshoring one person okay

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:51,450
two or three so reshoring which arguably

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:55,040
should be called on shoring I don't know

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:57,000
and is the process where the

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,980
manufacturers that we know in the West

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,470
are bringing back their manufacturing

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,840
capability into Europe and they're

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,850
putting the factories closer to where

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,370
the customers actually are of course

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,020
this is the ideal situation but why did

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,480
they move in the first place because it

00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,480
was cheaper to do offshore but reshoring

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,460
is driven by label asst factories

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,220
factories in England that don't have

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,710
anybody working in them so what comes

00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,410
next for 3d printing is actually

00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,960
localized clusters of medium-sized

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:30,210
manufacturers who can build widgets that

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,380
are probably smaller than a house but a

00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:36,600
bit larger than a bike part so the face

00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,820
of manufacturing is actually changing

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,580
right under our noses right but of

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,350
course it started small what's this

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,000
going to have what effect is it's going

00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,890
to have on relations with China where a

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,100
lot of stuff is built we don't actually

00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:52,170
know this photograph is two years old

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,940
this is a little bit more recent these

00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,130
guys are very secretive about what

00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,810
they're doing because they don't want

00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,730
other people to find their secret source

00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,230
but they are printing houses in

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,750
different shapes different sizes

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,110
different configurations all of them

00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:11,850
with without any labor involved and all

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:14,310
of them fully automated and in the world

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,600
of 3d printing is if you look into that

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,800
you'll see that they're doing some you

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,990
know Ottilie amazing things okay so we

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,330
are reducing marginal cost 20 x

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:28,330
automating things with 3d printers and

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:31,690
robots and software but now we have to

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:34,000
go back in time to Yorkshire we're back

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:37,780
in Yorkshire it's not the 1970s anymore

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,590
it's the 12th century and in the 12th

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,150
century we came up with this idea it's a

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,190
windmill and now I know there's a few

00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,050
dutch people in here yeah you thought

00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:52,900
you invented it in here but you didn't

00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:55,330
because we did in Yorkshire but but it

00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,860
must be said that the Dutch took our

00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,600
invention and made it better that's

00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:00,370
typical for English people we invent

00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,260
stuff and you know sort of discarded

00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:04,750
then somebody takes it further so the

00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,000
windmill was invented in the 12th

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,100
century and at the time it was a

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,950
gigantic innovation because the only

00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,710
source of power was water power water

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,870
streams rivers are always attached to

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,809
land and of course the wheel would go in

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:22,210
generate power one of the primary uses

00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:25,000
of water power back then was thumping

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,610
and that was where we pre-processed wool

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,010
so you had lots of wool underneath the

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,309
water wheel and attached to the wheel

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:35,380
were two gigantic arms on the end it was

00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:37,330
padded and as the wheel turned they

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,700
would alternate like Pistons and they

00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:42,250
would pound the wool bus making it easy

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,940
to handle and we've and they're knit

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,950
with I guess and that meant the people

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,410
using the wheel had to pay a rent to the

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,830
landlord and so therefore he literally

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,240
was the power holder of the village

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:57,730
windmills was the first sort of example

00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,530
of democratized power people could stick

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,240
a women on the end of the house build

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,160
their own craft products and then

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,960
exchanged exchanging them within the

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,990
villages and towns and even across

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,290
extended supplied sheds it was a massive

00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:14,370
massive boost to innovation at the time

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:17,770
the windmill went viral after that after

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:20,620
Yorkshire in only 150 years it was in

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,750
every corner of a Europe and actually

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,500
started to undermine that then political

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:29,350
system which was of course feudalism

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,470
there is a modern equivalent I always

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,940
say does anybody know where this is but

00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,980
that seems a bit stupid since we're in

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,270
Germany and I think you've all seen

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,020
images like this

00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:45,820
the train window no you are jamming are

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:48,130
ya hey how much how much solar power was

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,160
generated in Germany last year anybody

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:54,390
want a shout out on an answer you'll get

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,950
up he would good up okay he's not Jarrod

00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,690
okay he knows about he knows about

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,720
marginal cost doesn't know about green

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,560
energy okay about thirty percent of all

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,780
energy in Germany comes from renewables

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,610
it's gotten to the point now where in

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,170
Germany they do not build new call

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,990
stations because they're economically

00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,460
unviable so the the return on investment

00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,190
is being undermined by all the other

00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:20,470
investments in green energy so clearly

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:24,010
you have a sort of democracies power

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:25,750
source right solar with 3d printing and

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,340
low class manufacturing you start to get

00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,360
an image that what we used to have in

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,500
Yorkshire we might have again right now

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,850
solar panels are a sword or a hockey

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,860
stick you know they get more and more

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,030
efficient every year is a doubling of

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:41,940
efficiency and a halving of costs and

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:45,520
and this is real this is already real

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:49,360
now the most common feedback again about

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,880
this is well they don't work when it's

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,740
not sunny and it's never sunny in

00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:01,150
Germany or England right so my reply to

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:06,010
this is well have you seen that does

00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:08,910
anybody know what that is yes it is a

00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:14,110
song fastest yeah it's a big one

00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:18,040
it is the Atacama one station in South

00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:20,200
America and it's one of many the panels

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,660
are actually not solar panels but their

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,900
mirrors and they angle themselves to the

00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,900
central stick in the middle it looks a

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,460
bit like a selfie stick right I call

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,430
this a selfie stick model of solar

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:36,520
energy in England we call selfie sticks

00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,990
the wand of narcissus right there's

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,460
people walking around the British Museum

00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:44,800
wiping out priceless pieces of art so

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:49,450
the selfie stick model of solar energy

00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:50,980
and okay so clearly it produces a lot of

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,720
energy it's very sunny in South

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,940
America that's not the interesting part

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,919
of this story the interesting part of

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,169
the story is that down the main shaft

00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:02,980
and under the ground is a lot of salt

00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:05,440
and minerals the salt is super heated

00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,600
during the daytime and in the evening

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,230
when there's no Sun that he disappeared

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,690
and continues to drive the turbines so

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,140
they've created 24-hour power supply

00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:19,900
with a limited resource in this case the

00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,970
Sun so we're seeing the rise of

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,610
localized energy and we're seeing the

00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:28,179
rise of large-scale distributed energy

00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:30,250
networks energy this is my prediction

00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:32,290
correct if you let me come back next

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,590
year I'd like to see if it's true energy

00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:46,720
is about to become free that's my

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:49,510
prediction here in Germany now you've

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,850
brought the computer No ok right the

00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,760
third example of this this raised to

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,809
zero marginal costs software this is my

00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,640
favorite MSS fears DCOs an amazing piece

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:02,740
of kit will help you manage your hold

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,860
entered data center with much less

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,570
workers than you could even imagine

00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:10,030
terraform from hoshi Corp lecture

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,309
provision machines either locally or in

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,429
the cloud this thing in the bottom

00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:17,950
corner this is the elastic search

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,270
framework for metals and know something

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,940
about it because we built it out

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:25,480
container solutions and what we did is

00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,929
we combined missiles itself with elastic

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,840
search and we created searchable fault

00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:35,470
tolerant tolerant distributed data

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,679
source it's very hard to kill and once

00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:41,500
it's running it sort of manages itself

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,840
the two sides of this story first of all

00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,790
ten years ago all the engineers in the

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,590
world couldn't have built that right no

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,559
matter how long they had but we did it

00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,179
in a few months once it's deployed it

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,090
manages a whole range of machines

00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:57,070
without any human intervention so you

00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,620
could see we're doing much much more

00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,720
with much much less and the artifacts

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,990
that we're producing have much greater

00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,350
impact on the

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,000
we live in we don't sell this it's open

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:11,600
source you can download it you can

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,800
distribute it and you can use it of

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,300
course it's open source so it doesn't

00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,420
come with any warranties you use that at

00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:20,920
your own expense so software is

00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,920
contributing to this process as well

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:30,320
that's a hairdresser on the right and

00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:32,690
the data scientist on the left what of a

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:39,800
data scientist and hairdresser got in

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:42,140
common anybody they're both going to

00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,030
survive the age of machines they're both

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,130
going to survive the zero marginal cost

00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:49,010
society because they have jobs that

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:51,110
event very difficult to automate we

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,420
think about automation affecting only

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:56,000
the working classes it's actually not

00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,429
true automation affects jobs that are

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,309
routine right and those can be high

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,860
paying jobs or lower paid jobs machines

00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:07,730
are currently outperforming radiologists

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:10,059
and checking scans last week I read a

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:12,920
great story about a machine that was

00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:16,160
matching the medical profession in terms

00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:18,140
of breast cancer diagnosis but on top of

00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,270
that the machine discovered another

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,460
pattern in the scans that actually

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,260
predicted your chance of survival and

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,910
that would have an impact on the

00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,070
treatment plan the doctors could give

00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:30,679
you the machines were matching the

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,590
doctors and in some areas outperforming

00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,380
them a non routine job like hairdressing

00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:40,580
or data science is actually a little bit

00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:44,090
more immune to automation the common

00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:47,120
economic thinking here is that the

00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,770
rising tide floats all boats if you

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,960
watch the american election you will

00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,270
hear that as innovation innovations come

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,790
online the people who invent them they

00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,280
benefit the capitalists who deploy them

00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:01,360
benefit and the laborers benefit from

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,240
lower working hours and high wages and

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,490
yet we've seen a growth in inequality

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,440
recently so the rising tide metaphor was

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,080
working for most of the last century it

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,980
doesn't work anymore there's the reason

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,350
for that very simple we've gone from

00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:20,179
a situation where we could share the

00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,440
bounty of our innovation so an

00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,080
innovation like just-in-time

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,480
manufacturing for cars it spread General

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,790
Motors benefited Ford benefited and all

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,740
the labor force benefited in the world

00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:33,650
of software in high tech we have a

00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,510
winner takes all model facebook and

00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,340
myspace there is only one winner it

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,830
doesn't matter how good my space is

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,370
relatively in absolute terms it's gone

00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:45,230
Google is the dominant search engine

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,299
this problem is compounded by the fact

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,669
that only a handful of people work at

00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,320
Facebook so general motors even if they

00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:53,480
did a winner's share to win it takes or

00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:56,809
model would still employ thousands of

00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,460
people so Richmond where Kodak walls was

00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:00,679
a center of that community because it

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,470
employed so many people once you start

00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:07,700
to digitize you need less people and the

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,710
spread of bounty is skewed so that's one

00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:11,149
of the problems with the current

00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:16,280
situation one of the reasons why it's a

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:19,159
little bit untenable so in trying to

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,320
answer this question are we there yet it

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:24,230
does seem to me like we are at least on

00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,210
the way we have seen many many jobless

00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:28,310
recoveries there's a recession we

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,590
innovate we use software we fire people

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,050
the economy comes back but the job's

00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,030
done we've seen the stagnation of wages

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,649
we've seen higher unemployment and

00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,830
underemployment those are all in the

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:43,399
statistics for you to see the Dutch have

00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:45,980
seen this coming so right now in Utrecht

00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,379
in the Netherlands and they're running

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,859
an experiment to pay everybody a basic

00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:53,869
income a universal basic income is what

00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:57,260
it's called and what happens here is you

00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,420
get some money every month whether

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,850
you're rich or poor whether you're in

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,100
work or not in work and what they're

00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:07,550
trying to do with this experiment is to

00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,470
morph as well see if it works and

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,230
they're trying to come up with policy

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,670
and ideas that will actually make sure

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:17,060
that when this transition really starts

00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,859
to a care that they are ready the other

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:21,320
thing about universal basic income is

00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:23,060
this one of the reasons that automation

00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,980
hasn't spread as much as it should have

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,619
done is because it's still often chief

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,220
between poison body than it is to you

00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,859
know by a robot

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:34,200
universal basic income gives employees

00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:36,540
the chance to say I'm not working here

00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,930
right which forces the owners of capital

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,640
to actually automate even more so

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,990
there's a double sided thing to this in

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,869
a way it's getting ready for the

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:51,210
transition but it's also accelerating it

00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:53,730
too this is st. Ives in Cornwall in the

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,640
United Kingdom it's a beautiful place

00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,980
the people in st. Ives a sick of their

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,990
village being empty for 50 weeks of the

00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:03,990
year and then being descended upon by

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,180
londoners in the summer period so if

00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,800
you're born in sin eyes it's extremely

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,570
difficult to live there and raise your

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,640
children there because number one does

00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,400
no houses left and number two the ones

00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,890
that are left are extremely expensive

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,500
they've held a referendum to see this if

00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,810
you don't live in the house you can own

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,510
the house so essentially they're

00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:27,380
rejecting exchange values and

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:30,359
speculation of the property market there

00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,369
so all the world's eyes have currently

00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,440
turned to Utrecht in the Netherlands and

00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:39,270
st. Ives on the south coast of England

00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,070
can it really happen this is a question

00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,869
can it really really happen during the

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,480
last Industrial Revolution we used to

00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:51,359
send children to factories and down the

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,790
mines all over all over England and and

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,880
at one point we realized this was

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:59,760
morally repugnant we are taking their

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,589
the childhood of kids away I'm putting

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,599
them to work because we're trying to

00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:05,670
turn a profit in a factory even the

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,550
Victorians considered this to be a

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,560
pretty disgusting situation so what did

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,300
they do they lobbied and they pushed for

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,400
what became known as the factory acts

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:17,040
and the factory acts were about getting

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,310
children out of the factory and into

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,500
school exactly the same resistance we're

00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:25,470
here today about universal basic income

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,210
we heard back then you will destroy the

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,369
factory once the prophets have gone we

00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,119
can't pay for the church spire and God

00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:35,250
knows we need more church spires right

00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,660
the same arguments can we took the

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,720
children out of the factory and we

00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,880
replace them with machines so it

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,270
precipitated a growth in innovation and

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,660
alter

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,880
a graphing revenue and profit there is

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:53,520
historical precedent for the times were

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:57,660
currently living in okay that brings me

00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:02,220
to my my conclusion and I guess my my

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:04,230
biggest warning to everybody change is

00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,900
coming whether you want it to come or

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:09,450
not economic transitions happen all the

00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,610
time as I said in the beginning we've

00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:15,690
lived through a significant one in our

00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:20,070
lifetimes this is an image of a picket

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:22,980
line in Yorkshire in the 1980s we know

00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,430
that the situation we were in back in

00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,050
the 70s was untenable if my mum wanted

00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:30,900
to put a phone in the upstairs bedroom

00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:34,500
she would call British Telecom they

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,350
would come to the house in six to eight

00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,870
weeks six to eight weeks install the

00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:42,810
phone which we wouldn't earn because

00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:44,400
we'd rent it off the corporation and

00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,350
then they would leave and then every

00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,540
month would get a bill you know 50 pence

00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:51,330
or pound for the rental of the phone you

00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:54,510
cannot run a modern quemada country

00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:56,850
where labor is so sort of controlled

00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,820
that you can't get anything done it was

00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:02,640
untenable it had to change and yet the

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,380
brutality of the change in England was

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,810
never matched by the changes that were

00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,280
implemented in Germany and France so the

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,710
choices of the politicians in the

00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,070
different locations affected what came

00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,990
next I love this photograph in a way

00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,340
because you've got the labor force on

00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,020
one side and you've got the

00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,640
representatives of the government in

00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,550
this case the police on the other side

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,550
and the line down the middle is almost

00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:28,440
perfect and then it's a powerful

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,420
metaphor for the divisions in the United

00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,610
Kingdom at the time right down the

00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,470
middle people within the within the same

00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:39,330
families fighting over what we should do

00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:41,640
next and you hear similar stories now

00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,200
you hear similar divisions now look at

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,640
the political landscape look at what's

00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,920
happened in the United Kingdom and

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,350
Germany people are confused because the

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,770
suns are shifting and we don't know what

00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:56,549
to do fast-forward to 1989 to a very

00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,989
difficult moment

00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:01,739
many people in England the Hillsborough

00:39:57,989 --> 00:40:03,929
football disaster an accident I get two

00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:09,329
gates were left closed and extra people

00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:12,029
went into one gay force in a stampede 96

00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:13,650
people died that there many people

00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:15,329
remember watching it but actually what

00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:17,489
happened is there was a news flash and

00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:21,479
so the sort of the BBC switch from one

00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:25,769
piece of television to this I watched it

00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:28,769
with my brothers and I was too I was 12

00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:32,009
at the time and and this the site of

00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:33,509
sort of these the sort of children on

00:40:32,009 --> 00:40:36,059
advertising hoardings being sort of

00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:37,529
scuttled across the the field is some

00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:41,519
probably burned into the memory of

00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:43,650
everybody my age this incident was bad

00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,779
enough but it's what came next that

00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:48,380
really what really makes this stand down

00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:50,309
as a really dark moment in our history

00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,739
because what came next was an

00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:55,709
orchestrated cover up from the south

00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:58,349
yorkshire police in cahoots with a media

00:40:55,709 --> 00:41:01,199
machine right that has spent the last 10

00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:04,229
years perfecting a a sort of campaign

00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,150
against its own people so you wouldn't

00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:08,219
think of England ever undergoing a civil

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,429
war but those of us who lived in the 80s

00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:13,049
might have a rather different view I

00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:17,279
don't think anybody would like to go

00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:20,999
back to these times 25 years later 25

00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:23,999
years later an inquest finally reveals

00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:26,249
everything and the the families of the

00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:32,519
victims can sort of start to begin to

00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:33,989
put that chapter to bed and I don't

00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:36,029
think there's anybody in the united

00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:37,769
kingdom on the political left or right

00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:39,420
who ever want to go back to the

00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:44,689
situation that we were in in the

00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:47,549
nineteen eighties so every one of us in

00:41:44,689 --> 00:41:51,709
technology that's everybody in this room

00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:54,509
including me is complicit in bringing a

00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:56,910
wirkkala swirled into fruition we're

00:41:54,509 --> 00:41:59,999
responsible responsible for creating

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,699
this reality that means were duty-bound

00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:05,819
to confront this head-on and the way to

00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:08,849
do that is with discussion with dialogue

00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:09,619
and with small decisions decisions that

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:11,900
will compel

00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:15,559
to create a society that we actually

00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:18,619
want to live in these decisions are not

00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:23,349
for politicians to take tomorrow these

00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,349
are decisions that we have to take today

00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:26,829
thank

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:54,619
there are microphones for questions this

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,619
gentleman here

00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:07,350
thanks for this interesting and very

00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:10,710
inspiring talk from my point of view

00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:12,840
you're painting a quite dark future for

00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:16,530
us because when I imagine a world in

00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,270
there when nobody about hair cutters and

00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,130
data scientists have anything meaningful

00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:23,730
to do I don't know if I want to live in

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:28,410
a world like that so in what way do you

00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:30,660
see the need of innovation or the

00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:33,600
driving force of many of us in this room

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:37,310
is doing something new inventing

00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:42,300
something as a contradiction to this

00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:45,540
development of marginal costs going down

00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,130
and things like that okay so thank you

00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,600
for the question it's very interesting

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,490
that you comment I pen a dark picture

00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,090
because the feedback I got last time was

00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:56,250
what an optimistic talk which is like

00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:59,400
the only voice in like post capitalism's

00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,140
optimistic and so I love my job I love

00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,820
working it does provide me with a lot of

00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,620
meaning but I always say that we can

00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,300
have a lot of meaning in our work four

00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,570
or five hours a day instead of eight

00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,400
nine or ten and I I don't really of

00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,810
course I can't predict the future my

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,730
hope is that I don't think we should

00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,740
stop innovating I think we're it's a lot

00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,320
of energy fighting ourselves fighting

00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:21,840
each other and sort of there are other

00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,570
areas to innovate in social care how we

00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:27,180
teach our children you know teaching is

00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,830
augmented by technology in the same way

00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,440
that data science is augmented by

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:33,690
technology but it doesn't replace it so

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,910
i would like personally to see a sort of

00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,730
shift from like air if you look at the

00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:41,360
financial system we innovated remarkably

00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,770
in the last 30 years to avoid paying tax

00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,600
right I'd like to see that innovative

00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:49,280
energy just go to somewhere else

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:51,570
palliative care the care of our elderly

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,030
citizens and probably the care of our

00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:55,560
children and that people are a bit

00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:58,230
scared because like or what will I do if

00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,880
I don't work but just take a month off

00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:04,490
in the fourth week you'll soon learn

00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,490
right the afternoon pint awesome

00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,240
yes concerning 3d printing I think we

00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:18,970
have observed with 2d printing that it

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,430
gave us the possibility that we all can

00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:24,430
print high quality papers or we can

00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:28,210
print like books in very low numbers and

00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:31,500
they still possible to exist but i think

00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:34,289
the traditional 2d printing with mass

00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:37,509
printing hasn't really decreased and

00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:41,109
then when we think about 3d printing it

00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:44,380
allows us to do things in low numbers or

00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:47,759
let's say locally immediately like with

00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:51,549
this bicycle part but i think the

00:45:47,759 --> 00:45:54,430
large-scale production will at any time

00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:55,960
or for a long time outperform the 3d

00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:59,349
printing because it can kind of

00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,799
optimized on that I think you've almost

00:45:59,349 --> 00:46:04,000
right sort of so what he said was that

00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:05,650
3d printing is never going to come

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,180
online because it cannot compete with

00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,579
traditional manufactured is that correct

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:11,710
it cannot compete with when you have

00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:14,250
large numbers of the same thing or very

00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:17,589
similar where the mass production can

00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:20,730
profit from each lap its large scale yes

00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:23,769
so mass production profits from

00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:27,039
economies of scale of 3d 3d printing

00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:28,539
can't yeah I think he get it so mass

00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,940
production is at the very end of its

00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:33,039
technology lifecycle so ed technology

00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,750
starts the very first transistor was a

00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,849
huge piece of sand that would be

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,950
poisoned and they sort of they took the

00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:41,200
mains and they stuck the power in and it

00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:43,720
started to conduct within four decades

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,599
we've optimized the transistor to the

00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,789
iphone that sits in your pocket so the

00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:51,009
danger with your logic here is you're

00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:53,019
comparing beginning of cycle tech 3d

00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:56,049
printing with end of cycle tech mass

00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:58,809
manufactured now I do agree that in the

00:46:56,049 --> 00:47:01,000
next 10 20 years it won't catch up but

00:46:58,809 --> 00:47:02,769
3d printing and hockey stick as we bring

00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,869
out the optimizations and mass

00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:08,230
production will just flatlined so

00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:09,369
transitions are awful because you think

00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,279
you see them come in and then you

00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:13,539
dismiss them but let's see we'll come

00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:25,720
back next year maybe to see how far

00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:28,720
we've gone yes remark about that you

00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:32,170
said there was some British city when

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,660
they said that you couldn't they try to

00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:38,200
stop London people from buying the

00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:42,430
houses yeah yeah I i I've seen a similar

00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:44,920
system in Stockholm and I live and which

00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:48,130
we have had therefore sort of 60 years

00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:50,140
or so and the result of that is that you

00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,990
had to stand in a queue for 20 years to

00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:55,180
get an apartment in the central city so

00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:58,539
I would sort of worn for for that kind

00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,369
of system I I never I never gave the

00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:02,680
example because I think it's perfect or

00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:05,230
even good I tried to give the example

00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,089
because people are experimenting with

00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,339
different ways to regulate the housing

00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:10,809
market it's a bit similar in the

00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:13,589
Netherlands you have to wait for a very

00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:16,029
long time to get some social housing and

00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:17,890
housing the difficult one because an

00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:19,329
Englishman's home is his castle but I

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:24,009
think it's the same for everybody in

00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:26,680
Europe thanks so I was wondering if you

00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:29,740
could say a bit more about the idea of a

00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,180
basic income yes you were picturing it a

00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,009
bit of suggesting a bit that we are

00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,049
running out of work but we're only

00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:37,869
running out of work that is generating

00:48:35,049 --> 00:48:39,849
profit for capital and and you were

00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:43,119
pointing this out to the last question

00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:45,640
there's plenty of work in the inter you

00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,369
Minh area especially all kinds of

00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,980
nursing and teaching yeah and I think

00:48:48,369 --> 00:48:54,150
basic income is a good way to work

00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,740
around this contradiction and especially

00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:59,460
regarding open source software

00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:02,019
development and you can see that wages

00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,599
don't have to be a way of blackmailing

00:49:02,019 --> 00:49:06,730
people into word but wages are just

00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:08,740
something that we develop as neat

00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:12,039
because we need you know gadgets and

00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,930
Club matter and stuff yeah exactly so so

00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:16,359
I read an interesting thing the other

00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,829
week and it said the since when was the

00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:19,750
American dream about profit and loss

00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:23,230
because I thought it was about freedom

00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:25,210
and autonomy right so when when did when

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,430
did the capitalist sort of equation

00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,520
dominate start to dominate everything so

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:33,530
when you measure GDP you encourage

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,000
everything to be a trade so rather than

00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:37,160
getting your neighbor to walk your dog

00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,080
if you pay her 10 pound to do it that

00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:42,140
will register on your economic or

00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,480
economic GDP so what we've tended to do

00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,660
in the last 30 or 40 years its value

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,370
everything that generates profit and

00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,980
devalue everything that's to do with

00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:53,870
emotional work Parenthood and looking

00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:56,360
after people you know being a good

00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:59,360
citizen and that's a ver stopped

00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,550
happening or it's been out sourced so in

00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,590
a way the philosophical heart of

00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:06,740
universal basic income is to acknowledge

00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:09,050
as a society we do value you as a school

00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:12,260
teacher and we do value you as a parent

00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:14,060
and the reason mind in my skills are so

00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,850
much in demand is because of this skewed

00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:19,520
inequality but like honestly does the

00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,530
CEO of a software company really

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,530
generate more value than the children

00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:27,820
the teachers who teach my kids have to

00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:27,820
say how to say

00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:39,220
hey one can draw an analogy between this

00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:40,930
production and programming I mean in

00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,780
terms of marginal cost so in programs

00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:45,099
there is also a marginal cost like

00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,670
example if you choose more efficient

00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:50,430
language you will end your job faster so

00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:52,990
where do you think the biggest gains in

00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:57,130
productivity of programmers will come

00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:58,839
from going forward okay so he said that

00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:01,089
some marginal costs involved in software

00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:02,380
when you're creating it that's the labor

00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:04,180
and then the second part of your

00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,599
question was where will the increases in

00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:10,030
productivity come from I honest so I

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,680
don't mean to be crass but ideas are

00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,270
very special so software is special

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,000
because it's so sort of knowledge that's

00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,589
captured and easy to transmit ideas are

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,010
very special in the sense that they can

00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:23,140
have sex so we saw elasticsearch when it

00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:25,869
met mesos we created this awesome thing

00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,270
and for ideas to have sex you need lots

00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:30,580
and lots of ideas and you need a way for

00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:32,859
them to come together you need to

00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:35,320
facilitator to bring them together the

00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:37,080
internet is the greatest pimp of ideas

00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,859
in the complete history of humanity

00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,760
right so when we talk about like a

00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:44,230
privatizing parts of the internet it's

00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,700
extremely dangerous because what we're

00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:49,420
actually seeing is we're going to stop

00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:51,580
ideas being created and meet in each

00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:53,080
other universal basic income is

00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,960
interesting because there'll be more of

00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:58,060
us are working on these ideas online

00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,369
courses like the one you have for Skylar

00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:02,830
are also interesting because that's free

00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:04,810
education who's zero marginal costs are

00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:07,210
zero right other than the time it takes

00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:09,250
to learn follow the course so I think

00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,880
the greatest gains in productivity will

00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,260
come from more addies meeting each other

00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,700
container solutions are trying to get

00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,560
rid of all the nonsense around

00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,750
infrastructure provisioning because a

00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,220
machine can do it and we want to do that

00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,190
because we want to sort of create this

00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,060
world where more ideas are flowing

00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:26,500
that's probably where the next

00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,660
productivity gains are go to come from

00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,970
take the people out of operations free

00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,680
them from the awful situation but then

00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:36,940
immediately we're confronted with the

00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:39,670
question this will create a skewed value

00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:41,290
and who's that going to go to that's the

00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:44,070
political question that comes with your

00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,070
question

00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:49,430
so I think like you are missing two

00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,440
trends one of them is like every

00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,029
developed country is aging they'll be

00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,739
like less people working yeah and you

00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:57,140
know five years ago 10 years ago

00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:58,969
everybody will tell me you know like in

00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,920
the media that our system will collapse

00:52:58,969 --> 00:53:02,569
because we couldn't find out but right

00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,609
now we have automations and problem

00:53:02,569 --> 00:53:06,289
solid like what to worry about it and

00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:08,180
the second thing you know house in

00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:10,130
London doesn't cost two million because

00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:13,940
we couldn't create it but because it

00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:16,699
like so over regulated there is like we

00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,920
can create something cheaper we can put

00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:20,660
like higher burnings but which is not a

00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,119
does the problem not that you know there

00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:25,819
is like some just rich people I'm just

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,259
exploiting you know fixed market that

00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,359
you know you couldn't create a new stuff

00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:31,880
yeah so you know they training it and

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:34,640
they take advantage of that so you think

00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,559
its regulations in London that that

00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,900
drives the plans you know like compare

00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,910
housing to burning right housing in

00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:42,319
Barry's like so much cheaper it's still

00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,609
Europe you know it's like bricks you

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,170
know like it's not that far away you

00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:46,759
know what what is the difference why is

00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:48,739
it cheaper than in London because in

00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:50,539
burning was destroyed right so you could

00:53:48,739 --> 00:53:51,949
create something new right you know

00:53:50,539 --> 00:53:54,819
there is like nothing to protect me

00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:59,509
Bernie because it was destroyed okay so

00:53:54,819 --> 00:54:01,670
so the two okay so the two parts of the

00:53:59,509 --> 00:54:04,190
question is and the second part of the

00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:06,199
question was regulations affecting house

00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,519
prices in London and the first part was

00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:09,499
that i missed the trend of the aging

00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,150
population well I haven't actually

00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:13,640
missed it I do know that the population

00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,719
is aging but it's there's only like so

00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,999
many things you can address your mom

00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:19,130
talk the three big pressures right now

00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:22,940
I'm an aging population and the

00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:25,849
automation of all this work of the third

00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,650
problem i can't remember in London we

00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:29,959
don't build houses because people are

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:31,489
trying to protect the green space that's

00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:33,619
that's where the conflict comes from so

00:54:31,489 --> 00:54:35,719
it's not a heavily regulated market but

00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:39,019
people don't necessarily want to build

00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:41,150
new houses however if you own a house in

00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:43,249
London economically what's the smartest

00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,930
thing to do to make sure you block all

00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:46,219
new houses and that's because you're

00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:48,049
allowed to speculate with the thing you

00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:51,529
live in you take that away and you take

00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:52,789
away that pressure I never said I had

00:54:51,529 --> 00:54:55,390
solutions by the way I only came here

00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,390
with problems

00:54:56,110 --> 00:55:01,010
okay you talked about about the

00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,750
Democratic sizing production so it comes

00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:05,060
back to people with 3d printers of

00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:06,860
various sizes and all and you give an

00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,140
example of the phone company that's

00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,450
decades ago would have to come to your

00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:13,460
house and install the phone whereas now

00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,080
we if we want a new phone we go to the

00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,300
shop and buy a new iphone and the sim

00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:20,030
card right aren't you forgetting that

00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:22,700
part where the if you read the fine

00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:25,730
print you actually see that you only are

00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:27,500
renting the iphone and renting all the

00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:29,720
media that you buy and renting all the

00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:31,910
games from steam and it's all just for

00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:34,550
rental and the owners can take it away

00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,590
from you at any time you want they want

00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:38,210
yes so he said haven't missed the fan

00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,890
print in all of these new products that

00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:43,070
say you don't actually own it but you

00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:44,720
only rent it no I didn't read I didn't

00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,160
miss the fine print I didn't actually

00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,460
read it I that I going to know about it

00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,290
because of people like you and but good

00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,840
luck to Apple getting all your music

00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:56,300
back you know go and yourself Bruce

00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,250
Willis was like I'm gonna leave my music

00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,200
to my kids when I die an apple of like

00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,910
well actually it's our music and he's

00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,440
like whatever I think I think he put it

00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:06,650
all on a flash disk and gave it to them

00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,270
so what necessarily in our current legal

00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:10,160
framework doesn't dictate what's going

00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,450
to be in the next legal framework and I

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,670
think there's enough people sort of

00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:17,900
dissatisfied that there could be a shift

00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:19,400
there maybe I think that's all the

00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:22,240
questions so I'll just say thank you

00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,240
ever so much once again

00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:28,090
