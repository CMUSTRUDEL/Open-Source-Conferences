00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,510
Berlin 2016 we have a number of scarlet

00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:19,190
experts up here on stage we have three

00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:22,080
members from the Scala compiler team I

00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:26,160
will introduce them in individually

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,650

today we also have 22 members from EPFL

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:47,850

individually starting i'll do it in

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,829
order of number of Twitter followers oh

00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,960
by the way this is an interesting

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,929
there's an interesting fact about the

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,539
people on stage at the moment three

00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:12,929
people up here were born in the same

00:01:09,539 --> 00:01:19,560
country can you can you guess which

00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:23,069
country it was and who they are and send

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,259
77 send me a tweet phone sitting so send

00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:29,849

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,459
degrees have agreed to offer a small

00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,659
prize to the first person who can some

00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,459
some chocolates to the first person who

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,169
can guess this oh so so I I might have

00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,770
heard the answer there but the answer

00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:45,989
that befall that the full answer has has

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,549
the three names of the people as well so

00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:48,950
I got to check my Twitter feed

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,189
afterwards and see who the winner is

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,770
also 5 sorry six people on this on the

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,159
state have all lived in the same country

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,039
at some point in their careers what is

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,700
the country and who is the person who

00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:08,940
did not live in that country okay

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,500
the questions yeah more more more

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,709

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,640
and and I think quietly gets on with

00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,680
with a lot of the work in making the

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,989

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,560
back end is that right okay so that that

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,150
will that will arrive in in Scala 212

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,670
and you're also speaking at scala world

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:20,489

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:42,050

what maybe maybe the Sun I think Peter

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,169
looked has probably made the longest

00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:15,919
church okay Zealand okay yet

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:18,770
congratulations Peter but by being based

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,289
in in Australia you do guarantee that

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,110
with with your in Australia Adrian's in

00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:26,539
San Francisco and Lucas in in in Zurich

00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:31,070
you do guarantee that the Sun never sets

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:35,180
on scarlet compiler development so there

00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:37,669
is there is continuous development round

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,560
round round the clock on we're looking

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:44,810
to hire in Hawaii if anyone knows and

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,169
and and finally last but not least and

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,210
in fact most because you have heather

00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:54,550
has six thousand four hundred and

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,550
twenty-seven followers

00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:04,120
and is dominating effort here is a

00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:06,710
former PhD student at EPFL and now

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:18,919
executive director at the Scarlet center

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:20,419
and my boss welcome thank you and with

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,090
the introductions out the way I'm going

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:27,139
to jump straight into the questions now

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:29,960
we've opened up an online what's the

00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,180
call agents is it slider I don't have

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,910
pronounced okay so if anyone wants to

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,220
ask a question I would recommend getting

00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,820
your phone out and going to sli dot do

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,260
slide o / Scala days and you can write a

00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,320
question up there and I'll be monitoring

00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,599
this on my my screen and i'll try to

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,520
answer any questions that come in during

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,440
the during the panel you can also upload

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,150
them to yes you can also up folk the

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,039
questions that are there already I mean

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,150
those of you who prefer a human

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,960
interaction feel free to you as a

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,150
microphone John is against it but I'll

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,550
take questions life too yeah so if

00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,560
anyone wants to shout shout shout out to

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,720
agent yeah well but then you'll only get

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,550
an answer from oh ok cup you should also

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,289
raise your hand before you just randomly

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:16,400
shout because i think that people have

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:18,340
microphones are going around so yeah so

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,539
we had i think most of the questions

00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:25,820
well the biggest topic about on the on

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:29,680
the slide opole were questions about

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:33,140
Dottie and maybe unsurprising me and

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,529
someone said Dottie looks great when

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,529
will there be a release tagged as stable

00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,529
Adrian

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:47,019
whoo so I'm i don't know i don't set the

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,790
the dotty release timeline but i think

00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,079
the way that I look at it is that the

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,740
question really that you should have

00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:55,839
asked was when can I start using

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,689
features in Dottie and and the answer is

00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,879
to 12 and the next and the next releases

00:08:58,689 --> 00:09:02,860
after that and at some point you know

00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,800
the release set that is more closely

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,160
related to Dottie so for example in 212

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,470
we looked at what what the Dottie team

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,019
did for the train encoding and four

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,480
functions and you know they proved that

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:20,170
it was going to work and so then Jason

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,249
did all the hard work to make that you

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,689
know work in an hour set of requirements

00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:27,069
so I guess we can go into a little bit

00:09:25,689 --> 00:09:29,350
more detail maybe if there is a question

00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:30,819
about that or later or just we can

00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,220
decide to answer that question or so

00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:36,910
what's the release date for scholar to

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:39,459
12 so to 12 m5 is about to be cut we

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:43,870
don't as a rule we don't we don't cut

00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:45,999
releases to hearing Skala days but right

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,470
when we get back in d jet lag will cut

00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:50,079
the release and that's the last

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,660
milestone we had to actually fix one of

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,679
a bit of a snag that came up with the

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:59,499
trade encoding and invoke super but

00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:03,189
that's fixed now and so are c1 hopefully

00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:07,929
second half of July is kind of what you

00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:09,970
know I keep telling them or else and you

00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:14,249
know like about three RCS later we

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:17,139
should go final so sorry James ok around

00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:19,179
October yeah before I feel great I

00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:21,399
waited on by sep tember sorry sep tember

00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:24,309
maybe I'm late late August when it's

00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,629
ready ok when it when it's ready ok but

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:28,449
you know like let's say

00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:30,370
september-october timeframe so there's a

00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:35,410
follow-up question regarding Josie which

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:38,709
is will it be Scala three Jason opinions

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:44,379
on that I think that's the accepted term

00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:48,160
plan who decides good question of Martin

00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:49,389
I guess yeah I mean ok I mean it's sort

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
of it would be kind of consultative

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:54,850
decision to see what that means but

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:57,069
that's that's the question we're sort of

00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,399
I guess on the side of that question we

00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:02,319
want the jump from scarlet to dot X

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,740
whatever that X happens to be before

00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:08,290
three to be as these painful as possible

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,839
for our users and so that's why we want

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,579
to take steps in the meantime to bring

00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,470
features from the probe body back into

00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:18,759
the scholar two releases water bring in

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,470
warrant further warnings into the

00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:23,049
compiler to to warn you against

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,230
constructs which won't be as easy to

00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:29,350
migrate in addition at that point that

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,569
type of that jump there'll be automated

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,059
tools to help migrating source code to

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:36,399
source code for a certain syntactic

00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,779
things that I no longer supported for

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,290
example but can be automatically

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,029
translated so so so this actually may be

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,350
answers already one of the any other

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,139
questions so something's pointed out

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,360
that Python suffered a protracted and

00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:52,149
damaging and still incomplete migration

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,249
from version 2 to 3 and and how can

00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,439
install a scarlet avoid something

00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:58,329
similar happening yes I mean that's

00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:00,730
those are the some of the steps were

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:02,669
type we want to take I think another

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,579
step that gives us good data about how

00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:09,669
disruptive the changes is the fact that

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,850
we build ourselves something like a

00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:15,939
million lines of open source Scala code

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:17,379
every night and that tells us about bugs

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:19,509
that we've introduced into the compiler

00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:21,790
of the library that that day at some

00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:24,279
point around this hemisphere of the

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,459
globe as we've been continuously hacking

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,249
away and that'll be a good tool for us

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,699
to help as and when we get to this point

00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:36,549
of migrating to Dottie that will be able

00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:38,230
to establish compatibility between

00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,480
programs under under the gnu compiler

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,309
and there's still a lot of work to do to

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,990
get there but that's that's a level of

00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:46,600
confidence that with that we would want

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,829
to have ourselves before we we impose

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,809
that on the world you need to make sure

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:53,919
that things are smooth as possible and

00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:56,699
I'm sorry I just looked at the the slide

00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:00,550
a pole and the current trending question

00:12:56,699 --> 00:13:02,620
with 40 for upvotes if I said it

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,980
47 on heathers phone my laptop's of its

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:10,510
own right apart or something AC is where

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,830
is Martin we could it's a bit like from

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,750
from parents a bit like Where's Wally

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,890
and we try to pick out Martin in the

00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,690
audience is are you here Martin hello so

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,700
the answer the question is in the

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,680
audience over there enjoying the

00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:28,089
relaxing he's working on the compiler

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,980
he's working but yeah the guy behind him

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,430
is not ink yes then he definitely is

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,450
working on daddy someone someone did ask

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,800
a very very specific question about

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,440
about Dottie which I'm going to pass

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,769
over to either a journal Jason whoever

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,260
wants to take it but sir in da see if a

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:51,399
and person B is the same type as be

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,200
ampersand a and replaces a with B how

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,320
does it affects the whole abstract

00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,450
override mechanism it does so for those

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,029
those who don't know Scala has a feature

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,450
which allows you to define a method in a

00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,730
trait as overriding a method with the

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,740
same name which comes from a super tight

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,390
but without actually knowing what that

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:12,430
implementation is at the point you you

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,920
define it this is this is called

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:19,480
abstract override and it's a little bit

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:23,140
esoteric so I think a quick answer if

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:26,320
you have one Adrian or JC yeah um we do

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,450
I don't know it doesn't so as always

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,130
types are in an approximation of what

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,880
your what your program is going to do at

00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:37,089
runtime and the fact that a and b and b

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,670
is the same as B and a is something that

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:42,579
that improves the theory or the elegance

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,910
of the theory and in Scala a with be

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:48,040
kind of caused problems in the end in

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,630
the theory but these types are things

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,440
that just described which members are

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,240
available and which result type a method

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,820
will have because with a with B

00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,350
linearization determines what there is

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,720
what the result type will be of a method

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,029
for example whereas with a and B these

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,339
things are pushed down as we say so when

00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:09,579
you have a method with the same name an

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,470
a and B then a NB will have that method

00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:13,630
with it the result type being the result

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,320
type of the method of a and the result

00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,300
I've of the method

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,550
be so in that sense it's more precise

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,230
it's more regular but it actually has

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,340
nothing to do with which method gets

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,630
chosen in terms of overriding at runtime

00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,820
that's that's not modeled by the type

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,680
system and it actually doesn't matter

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,690
which one gets chosen from a typing

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,320
point of view because both return types

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,490
were ended together and so that's kind

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,220
of the artifact that we want to get rid

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,930
of in dotty we're with the width

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,110
construct that actually is modeled and

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:48,040
it shouldn't be I mean if you find a

00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:51,310
beer I cancer sorry I may have a simpler

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,190
answer okay yeah please so there are two

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,960
uses with in Scala there is the width

00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,640
that you use in the extents clause and

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,470
there is a width that you use in a tight

00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,980
the only the second one is replaced by

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:08,800
and and only the first one effects

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:12,940
abstract / right and linearization order

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,470
so no end is not going to to to

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,900
influence abstract all right simply

00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,570
because it's it does only replaces the

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,240
use of width in types and not the use of

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:28,510
width in extends class what's the best

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,460
inside thank you thanks so sometimes

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,160
almost has pointed out that whilst

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:38,830
Scarlett Scarlett 212 is is just around

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:41,770
the corner so is Java nine and I are you

00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:46,390
planning to support modules in in Scala

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:49,210
at at any point yeah so we've opened up

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,220
a ticket that enumerates the list of of

00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,770
work that we we know that we have to do

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,570
so far to support java nine in general

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,300
and the modules is probably the biggest

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:02,200
part of that we've taken a couple steps

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:05,800
towards that so for example in Joba nine

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,360
there's no longer our tea jar containing

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,699
the the standard library of Java

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,860
available in the distribution and that's

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,540
the first problem you run into when you

00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,300
try to run the Scala compiler with Java

00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:18,010
nine so we've prototyped affixed to that

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,500
that uses the new mechanism to get to

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,800
the same information that Java provides

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:27,070
and as soon as we finish two to twelve

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,760
dot zero will we plan to merge that

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,970
change

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,170
and look a bit more closely at what

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:35,230
extra command-line options we need to

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:38,530
expose to you guys using the compiler to

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:42,040
depend on modules rather than just jar

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:46,150
files and and so on I think an in

00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,430
general the UI for that would be more or

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,270
less what Java Sea is offering you know

00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:54,880
the the command line or the EU I about

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:57,370
compiler is one more or less the same so

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,210
we just have to work towards that and as

00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,230
to when it might come that's the sort of

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:04,240
incremental feature that can be shipped

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,820
in a minor release of Scala so we can

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
come at perhaps labeled as experimental

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:13,150
in into 12-1 that's some time frame so

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,030
you even for 213 yes definitely okay and

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,710
and and deserve a follow-up we said I

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,430
are you planning to investigate j-link

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:25,720
for 213 I'm not familiar with j-link are

00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:29,740
you I so jet j-link is a need till

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:33,700
proposed for java 9 that lets

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,310
applications linked together class files

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,580
in in some way run optimizations or

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:41,680
maybe eliminate dead code sort of

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,030
proguard style applications so i think i

00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,210
think as i understand it it's a

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:50,110
framework for tools like proguard and so

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:54,040
on it's interestingly i know that

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,600
dimitris in Martin's labs experiment

00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,300
with the idea of a linker and with them

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,130
what that could mean for Scala that

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,670
would give the opportunity for example

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,260
to run the optimizer as a separate bill

00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,470
stepp not necessarily something you do

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:13,060
during the original compilation of your

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:15,310
code and lucas's new back end work I

00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,710
think that's a nice platform that even

00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,780
in Scala 212 you could reuse parts of

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,300
the compiler that do the optimization on

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,110
third-party jar files or your own jar

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:28,840
files at a later point I don't know

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,820
whether j-link is necessarily important

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,620
for that or not I mean we sort of can I

00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,780
think just do that as an svt plugin

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,950
without further work but I haven't

00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:41,020
looked at it deeply enough to isolate

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,300
we've asked some questions about the

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,840
garlic compiler someone else asked about

00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:50,800
docker and noted that many other

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,870
languages have official docker docker

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,150
images available and Skyler doesn't and

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:58,600
the question is will buscarla one day

00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:00,640
have or maybe soon have a docker image

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,710
so had the result something the scholars

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,180
in Tecate um conceivably sure but we

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,490
have we i mean this was actually the

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,590
first time that ever had ever like it

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,230
entered my sphere of well we should

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,990
think about that so conceivably yes i

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,760
would have to figure out who would be

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,380
responsible for keeping an eye on this

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,750
and continuing to make sure that it's

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,930
updated and whatnot but yeah conceivably

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:28,180
doesn't seem like it's such a huge task

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:32,260
sure i mean it may just be a matter of

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,300
blessing but an existing an existing

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,890
doctrine yeah that or just making sure

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,660
that there's somebody who is going to

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,910
keep making sure that you know it

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,310
there's always one being published when

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,620
things get updated so it's I think

00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:46,990
that's the regularity point is more is

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,380
more difficult to obtain but yeah yeah

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,150
conceivably sure and in general for for

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,460
think things like this where scholars

00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:58,240
sort of has a gap what circles the

00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,220
process for if it is something that

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,660
people think might be something the

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,750
Scarlet center could do what's the

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,210
process for proposing it so it's pretty

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,910
easy to if it's something that's you

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,680
know clearly a great idea and it's not

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:15,370
the world's largest commitment in terms

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,560
of time and manpower then you know like

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,840
such as this making sure that there's a

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,250
docker image published for Scala because

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,620
every other language has what I mean yes

00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,390
that's a that's not a huge ridiculously

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,340
huge commitment perhaps one of us could

00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,050
make sure that that's always happening

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:34,000
at a regular you know on a regular rate

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:35,590
but larger things so one suggestion or

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,450
one thing that that you know has been

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,460
suggested to us many times it's like hey

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,680
make scala native exist make it like

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,990
awesome make it you know production

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,820
ready in that it uh these are things

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,370
where I can't just be like sure we'll do

00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,830
that this is something where it's it's

00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,280
rather large investment it's a lot of

00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,710
time perhaps one or two people to work

00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,529
on

00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:00,230
and in this case usually what we what we

00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:01,399
would do is we would go to this advisory

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,409
board meeting we would all have a

00:22:01,399 --> 00:22:04,580
discussion about like you know make a

00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:06,649
list of the things that are really

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,149
important and say which which of these

00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:11,299
things does everybody sort of

00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:13,760
unanimously think are very important and

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:16,640
that we should look at and try to invest

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,580
energy and we kind of come to some sort

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,470
of consensus at this discussion about

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,230
the things that are rather important in

00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,529
largest investments in terms of time and

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,590
energy and we end up with a queue of

00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,360
these tasks and of course the the amount

00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:34,970
of work is greater than the people that

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,370
we have but let's just say we have three

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,289
or may know maybe four people and they

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,299
all have different capabilities so given

00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:43,549
this enormous queue of stuff that's

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,700
really cool that we should work on we

00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:47,899
try to take the things that we we get

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,570
feedback from the advisory board meeting

00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:53,120
and also just in general from people you

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,820
know discussing things conversations

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,169
coming back to bill we try to gauge how

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,750
important something is how much people

00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:01,549
care about it and then from there given

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,070
the sort of the capabilities that the

00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:07,460
Skala Center has the energy that we have

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,899
the sort of the profiles of the people

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,399
that are working with us and whether or

00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:12,140
not they would be a good fit for some of

00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:15,049
the projects that we have we try to sort

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,580
of match the the capabilities and skills

00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:18,710
of people that are working for us with

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,630
sort of the more important tasks that we

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,039
we know that you know generally

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,929
everybody agrees this is a good thing

00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:25,460
that we all should have and we try to

00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:28,130
match these things up and get those

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,049
things done first again I just like to

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:31,760
point out that the list of things that

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:35,029
that we should have that's good for

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,980
everybody's greatly longer than than the

00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:39,140
people and energy and the money that we

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,820
have to you know do it all so it's it's

00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,789
really like a little dense where we're

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:46,070
trying to sort of optimize the the

00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:47,750
skills and and sort of like the

00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,730
important tasks and match them up and

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,440
get those things done first so so it's a

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,630
bill you're the you're the community

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,760
representative what would you like

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,429
people to do is a potentially a sort of

00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,140
filter for the Scarlet center to sort of

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:05,389
gauge the feeling amongst the community

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:07,399
that's you you know I yeah my I see my

00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:08,380
job in and maybe you can kill me if I

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:12,010
have other job

00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:16,150
but as just listening mostly so uh I

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:17,940
would like to hear what people want you

00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,760
know what pain points there are what

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:25,270
dreams you have for Scala and and then I

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,680
would forward to to the center so the

00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:32,320
other people on the advisory board have

00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:34,720
paid money so so the community members

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,600
or to sort of have a balance to the

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,790
commercial needs right so that's what it

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,680
is so different I mean he was talking in

00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:44,350
the hallway some people do that you

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,670
could write a blog post and email me and

00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,280
then I think that's kind of if you

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:50,320
actually have a few things to say put

00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,640
them up on a blog post and then let me

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,780
know about it and I'll tweet about it

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,190
and tell those guys about it and that's

00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,110
I think that's a good way to do it as

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,870
well yeah and we'd like to add more

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,040
community members to this board but the

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,780
only thing is that we're trying to

00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,120
follow the rules that drew that are set

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,830
and the bylaws so at the next meeting

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,510
we're going to go and make sure

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,550
everybody is like yes we you know

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:11,860
informally we all agree but we're going

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:14,380
to formally you know change the bylaws

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,630
and add a new a new community member so

00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,610
long as you know everybody still agrees

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,340
in August so we should have a second

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,990
member soon but yeah we want to make

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,570
sure that you know there's more

00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:28,230
representation for everybody on this

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:32,050
board so we have another question

00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:33,610
currently trending on tied for second

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:35,860
place well its type of second place

00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,290
which is no it'sit's second place now

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,780
it's got one its 54 votes okay the

00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,580
question is where can I get a pair of

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:48,270
those fabulous rainbow colored socks

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:50,650
Adrian same store has John uh yeah

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,910
something someone's asking about my my

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:57,220
socks I I I can't remember I'm afraid I

00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,830
will have a sweet I will treat the

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,660
answer later they're actually there

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,410
they'll be the gift for the the prize

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:10,240
for the second question oh gosh I'm not

00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:11,710
sure how I feel about that so most well

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,990
we've got a lot of questions have been

00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:16,060
asked by someone called anonymous on

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:19,570
this on this video please stand up but

00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,779
but I'm not one from someone else Sam

00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,080
holiday has asked

00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:27,119
he's not here but nevertheless he's made

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,529
his presence felt by asking several

00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:33,659
questions he notes that both enzyme and

00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:36,029
thus caller ID ide rely on the

00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,859
presentation compiler but it has

00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,409
problems with macros and it has problems

00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:44,309
with with other things too I'm sure are

00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:49,830
there plans to fix it while you're

00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:54,059
looking at us I don't know maybe maybe

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:57,059
jason has a better after it so the

00:26:54,059 --> 00:27:01,379
presentation compiler works with macros

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:03,799
it's it's not a problem with with that

00:27:01,379 --> 00:27:06,239
there are difficulties if you're using

00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:09,659
flavors of macros that compute return

00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:11,969
type so white box macro is in the

00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,099
particular case that you're using Scala

00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:16,739
to 10 with the presentation compiler

00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:21,389
that's based on the 211 compiler that's

00:27:16,739 --> 00:27:23,219
so that's that's a combination can

00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:24,899
happen within Scala IDE because they

00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:27,629
support multiple versions in this way

00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:29,309
just by using the newer compiler but the

00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:31,710
new compilers not able to call old

00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,690
macros so rather than expanding your

00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:37,080
macros to compute types that are needed

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:39,499
um it just bails out and uses the

00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,419
declared types of the of the macro

00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:45,269
declaration so that's if you're using

00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:48,239
white box macros which are the flavor

00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:50,460
that's sort of less powerful but also

00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:54,269
has left these less restrictions in

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:59,009
terms of IDE support and to the same

00:27:54,269 --> 00:28:00,599
regard IntelliJ support your ok so there

00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:02,969
may be other issues I know this has been

00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:05,009
been tickets at sams raids that we've

00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:06,479
helped out with in the past I'm sure

00:28:05,009 --> 00:28:08,639
there are more and we're going to

00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:11,190
continue working on this in as I've

00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:13,080
scholar to 11-8 the the rep itself isn't

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,599
as a client of the presentation compiler

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,979
so we're sort of used to that every day

00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,679
so we're eating your own and dog food

00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:24,269
there we're interested also to keep it

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:27,450
improving okay thanks thanks Jason so we

00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:32,220
had quite a lot of questions about micro

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:34,509
services and logo we we don't I think

00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,089
have a residence

00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:39,279
is the real James Robert please James

00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:40,929
you around would you mind if you're here

00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,449
if you're not working on the gone right

00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:47,859
now which we should be I don't another

00:28:43,449 --> 00:28:50,199
scale see James no no so I'm afraid

00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:54,369
we're gonna have to skip over the we

00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:57,820
only do microservice with you yeah so or

00:28:54,369 --> 00:29:01,329
all questions must be must be Matt crew

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:05,949
based that wasn't quite what you said

00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:07,749
was it oh it's okay close it up so this

00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:09,309
question do do we do we still need

00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,919
abstract classes if we can pass

00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:15,329
parameters directly two traits now could

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:19,269
that could that entire entity be

00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:24,429
eliminated from Scala well now is a

00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:26,949
little bit immature premature let's say

00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:28,869
in in in in parallel we have great

00:29:26,949 --> 00:29:30,309
prompting introduced no sure so I mean

00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:33,519
I'd love to add trade for amateurs to

00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:35,679
some Scala to X version in the not to 13

00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,789
but maybe after that or maybe to 13 who

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,619
knows so I think you know abstract

00:29:39,789 --> 00:29:44,619
classes will remain as a as an

00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:46,089
implementation detail that even with the

00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:49,959
new trade encoding you still have some

00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:51,759
impact of you know the differences

00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:53,949
between our traits and interfaces and we

00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:57,519
need to remedy those when traits are

00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:59,529
mixed into a class so that's one useful

00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,909
tool that is maybe a bit more for the

00:29:59,529 --> 00:30:06,190
expert user like you know do not don't

00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:08,619
think that having to very subtly

00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,009
different features slightly different

00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:13,299
but distinct features is potentially

00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:15,609
quite confusing for new users and

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,979
essentially an easy win in terms of

00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:21,489
simplification yeah i think in principle

00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:22,959
yes this specific advantage of an

00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:25,749
abstract classes that you can add a

00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:28,359
field to it and the separate a

00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:30,069
previously compiled subclass doesn't

00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,309
need to do anything further whereas if

00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:34,690
you add a field to it to a trait

00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:36,639
previously compiled subclass has to be

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,669
recompiled because the storage for that

00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:42,339
field has to be in a class so it's

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:44,300
traits the trade encoding in Scala 212

00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:46,010
is less clunky

00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,820
in sort of where you look at how it

00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,370
translates the JVM and then to 11 but we

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,740
can only go as far as the JVM allows us

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:57,830
so I guess just to elaborate a bit on

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,500
that point in in Scala 212 the the body

00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:04,370
of methods and traits is now stored in

00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:08,030
the interface in in the method because

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,740
Java rate allows for this previously we

00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,130
had to create a trait implementation

00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:15,800
class so T dollar class and put static

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,440
methods in there which I'm you know not

00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,120
only confused that was unnecessary

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,340
complexity in the compiler itself but

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,770
was visible as you were debugging your

00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:29,630
code and looking at stack traces but

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:31,910
some yeah if java supported default

00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,400
fields and in it interfaces we could go

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,400
further but until such time abstract

00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:41,170
classes to have some important but do

00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:43,400
you have any way of lobbying for that

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:46,070
that's so it's a good question actually

00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:49,220
what what relationship do we have with

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:51,560
OpenJDK and oracle is doing most of the

00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,330
work and contribution at the moment we

00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,180
do we don't have the sort of

00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,220
relationship where where we can

00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:01,070
participate in their community process

00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:03,110
and lobby for change in a way that is

00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:06,680
really helpful for I think for our users

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,840
because it's talk to the five years of

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:13,280
time frames before the results sir I

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:16,100
needed so that said we are trying to get

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,290
better at Tom at being part of the

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,140
community I think even though we're

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,420
limited in the size of our team and our

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,310
resources in time we do want to to make

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,990
a build a better bridge there so for the

00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,700
last couple years members of our team

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:32,090
have been heading to champion language

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:35,570
summit Lucas presented last year I think

00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:37,910
or the year before last year and that

00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,110
just gives us an informal way to to stay

00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:42,890
in touch with the engineers who are

00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:45,440
working on on the JVM what are those

00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:48,320
summits like Lucas what are those

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,010
summits like so those sounds are

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,130
basically meetups of people compiling to

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:57,580
the JVM let's say so that's most

00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,840
famously java and

00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,060
then jruby groovy and then there's

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,420
projects that effect maybe our bytecode

00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:14,530
a bit less like combining javascript to

00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:17,790
JVM so there's lots of work on on using

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:20,470
the new dynamic features of the JVM in

00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:23,830
also some Oracle internal projects is

00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:29,170
nana's horn vm which executes JavaScript

00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:31,540
on the JVM and other than that it's a

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,550
conference with presentations talks I

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:38,320
talked about scholars value classes

00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:40,570
because as you might know Java well some

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,980
people working on the JVM some Brian

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,400
gets is spending a lot of time thinking

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:47,740
about value classes and specialization

00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,230
how to implement that on a che vm level

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,630
and so i just presented like the state

00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:55,510
of our kin Scala how do we do it what

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,490
can we do where are the limitations okay

00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:58,840
thankthank you Lucas so Heather just

00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,240
alerted me to probably the most

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,440
important question will get on the bond

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,480
the panel I'm going to ask the same

00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,950
question to to everybody and ask you to

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:17,520
raise your hands spaces or tabs vote

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:21,970
votes for vote votes for tabs and I'm

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,280
folks folks for spaces and then the

00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:31,780
audience the audience as well space

00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:35,050
spaces oh yeah okay how many 2220 it's

00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,400
too long it's two or four depending on

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:42,040
whether it's indentation or a

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,660
continuation now it now it's getting

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,810
computed you can read this kind of just

00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:49,030
our girls expenses could could we not

00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:52,120
just use Scala format and isn't that

00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:53,650
this right whatever whatever we like so

00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,060
sorry good good could be not just use

00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:57,580
Scala format and write whatever the hell

00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,550
we like it are in our wide space well

00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,320
sure but I mean it means yes goddess

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,670
Gaia format has some some defaults and

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,220
depending on the style that you use it

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,550
will apply one or the

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,410
sure yeah if you use the scariest i will

00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:13,619
apply the force bases and continuations

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:16,200
and and just just do to extend the

00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:18,300
question to the audience who who uses

00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,880
anything other than two spaces for

00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,460
indentation and we're a very tolerant

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,109
communities yes I don't think don't be

00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:30,930
embarrassed to reach your hair is this

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:32,550
that's fine huh it's one so I intended

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:37,380
to think we might have sold this age-old

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:39,240
problem yeah i think the the correct

00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,740
answer is two spaces yes we know

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,910
pressure how long before this can be

00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:49,770
enforced by the compiler where's my

00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:52,290
laptop I mean it it worked for make

00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:54,030
files didn't miss him I like to write

00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,040
little white space poem so I don't

00:35:54,030 --> 00:36:00,540
really want to like I don't want to

00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,250
standardize ok so the desert maybe I

00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:08,970
mean more serious question being asked

00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:10,980
about about project jigsaw will will

00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,050
scholar an svt take advantage of project

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,730
jigsaw in any sense now I didn't I

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,180
hadn't heard of Project X or based java

00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:20,130
line so we kind of answered it okay not

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,290
not and not maybe in the level of detail

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,200
that they were hoping for but right okay

00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:28,080
i I didn't i'm showing my nighty too

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,520
terrible yeah i don't know anything

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,990
about java yeah I i copy pasted the the

00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,250
explanation of project jigsaw into my

00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,320
notes and I was going to read that out

00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:41,070
but I guess that's not so relevant now

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:44,070
it's Java nine so other any other good

00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:48,810
questions Heather just just crashed hold

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:54,180
on so here's a question which I'm gonna

00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:55,560
ask to probably sebastia and just like

00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,690
you're emailing your neighbor across the

00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,950
street cuz they're right there it's at

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:00,180
second bill I feel like we're in

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,710
emailing our neighbor across the street

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,760
instead of just walking over there and

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,900
talking to them because you guys right

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:11,190
here oh you can raise your hand too I

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:13,710
missed it good question here but what's

00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:16,980
what's it like Sebastian doing doing a

00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:23,660
PhD under Martin and then I'm gonna ask

00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,660
the same question to Lucas and Heather I

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:31,080
i can i can ask whoever is most willing

00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:33,930
to answer first and then then everyone

00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:37,320
else can just say me too probably the

00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:43,290
best thing is that if you're willing to

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:47,940
do your thing and you can so if if you

00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:49,950
have a lot of of ideas and you can

00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,050
progress on on your own that that's a

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,020
very nice very nice thing because you

00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,780
have the opportunity to do that and also

00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,530
a second thing which is really really

00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:04,290
cool especially to me is that you have

00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:10,339
the opportunity to work on things that

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:14,400
matter I mean in an immediate sense so I

00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:18,810
mean look at scholar jeaious its its

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,730
report only a very difficult PhD project

00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,210
in the sense that is very hard to

00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:26,280
publish in academic journals about it

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:30,359
but I still get to do a PhD on that and

00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,089
I I get to work on something that is

00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:34,950
used by we really we have estimated a

00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:37,980
few thousands of developers at the

00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:40,400
moment and the feedback loop is is

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,260
immediate and I really really love that

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,960
so I think these are the two most

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:49,410
important things about doing a PhD in

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,420
this lab okay thanks thanks Sebastian

00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,820
Lew Lucas is what what's what's your

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:57,780
experience yeah it's been how many years

00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:01,200
since you finished now I think two and a

00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:04,320
half years since I finished um Stiller

00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,930
sort of recent Teresa yeah still I still

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,760
know a lot of people in the lab did you

00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,430
say did you say trauma or writing a

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,940
dissertation like I still haven't gotten

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,920
over it so I was lucky enough that by

00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,119
the time I finished there happened to be

00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,470
an open position in this company and I

00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,630
worked a little bit on some scholar

00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,600
compiler stuff before which I always

00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:33,030
enjoyed to most degrees

00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:35,280
and yeah I I think I completely agree

00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,320
with Sebastian these are the two most

00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,140
important things you can you can work on

00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,350
really cool stuff that impacts people

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,470
and you get to you get to choose to a

00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:48,360
logically what you want to work on how

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,400
about to do you have any to us um no

00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,220
actually I'm gonna I'm going to invoke

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,990
the me to write because Sebastian very

00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,260
well very very good job of summarizing

00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:00,390
kind of the you know the nice situation

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:02,160
that you have the ability to work on

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,310
things that are immediately relevant

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,450
because I mean if you if you if you're

00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,450
bored and you're kind of looking around

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:10,860
in these academic journals sometimes you

00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,110
know a lot of stuff just seems really

00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,180
out there and maybe it's maybe it will

00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,530
one day be relevant and cool and you

00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,750
know find its way into something that

00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,950
people care about but a lot of the stuff

00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,720
that's kind of difficult to see how

00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,120
maybe it will be attached to anything

00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,310
realistic and working on on Scallan

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,800
around scale it's always you know a lot

00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,050
more immediate a lot more more quickly

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,460
you know it's it's a lot it's not easier

00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,770
to see how quickly something can become

00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,900
relevant so that's that's one very cool

00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:40,500
thing about working in this group so as

00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:42,360
I meet me too me too so someone songs

00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,360
asked Bob what's the book you're reading

00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,640
a journey I can see from here it's it's

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,590
got some notes about oh yeah it's my

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,970
little red book i was listening to

00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:56,360
badges of people who said more than two

00:40:50,970 --> 00:41:00,300
spaces but but just just to ask the

00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,470
question to the panel what some what

00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,520
what books do you have beside your bed

00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:08,780
at the moment if if any bill i'm sure

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,780
you're reading something interesting you

00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,980
know

00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:19,110
I I'll get to come back to me at the end

00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,590
programming scope edition third edition

00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:25,200
is I I have so much I had to spend so

00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:28,020
much time writing that I couldn't have

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:33,000
any spare time to read but I just was

00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,950
reading mysteries so just don't let sit

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,590
okay is anyone else reading a book at

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:40,110
the moment what what what does the what

00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:45,000
is the Scala compiler team due to wind

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:47,790
down if you ever do yeah well guys sleep

00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,530
once in a while no no we actually have a

00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:53,040
pretty good work-life balance at light

00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:54,840
Bend I mean I guess the the most recent

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,870
book that I liked reading was the wisdom

00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:02,280
of insecurity by alan watts it's a

00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:04,260
pretty old one yeah and yeah any other

00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,360
book recommendations I wasn't gonna

00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,770
record well I little literally answer

00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,270
your question yes the book I haven't

00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,760
read but it's sitting next to me on that

00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:13,440
next to my bed so the making of the

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,290
atomic bomb i think by this guy who want

00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:22,950
to Pulitzer Prize yeah cool it's not a

00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:24,450
hands-on kind of book but as far as I

00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,610
understand from the from where it says

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:29,250
on the cover anyway so so you've

00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:32,310
mentioned there's quite a good work-life

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,160
balance at life in light light bends

00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:37,350
just had 20 million dollars of seriously

00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,020
investment yeah what they all send as

00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:41,670
the centers on vacation what so what

00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:45,690
material difference will that make the

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:47,760
the compiler team if if any I think you

00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:51,200
know there's this last round is more

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,700
about expansion and we had a pretty

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,030
pretty heavy emphasis on engineering

00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:58,470
hiring in the in the past and so this

00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,820
investment is actually going more

00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:05,550
towards expanding in the market and will

00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:10,140
basically most teams in in light band

00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:13,230
vary between one and seven people we're

00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:16,650
at five so you know maybe I hope we'll

00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:18,690
add one more person but I think once you

00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:23,940
once you get past that we're about 100

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:25,440
people in the company and yeah my boss

00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,589
is here so I don't I don't want to put a

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,999
number on how many ninja

00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:29,049
earring but I would say it's about sixty

00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,460
percent or something like that I

00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:36,999
actually don't remember where we've

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:39,460
grown a lot is it not okay yeah qualia

00:43:36,999 --> 00:43:43,569
so I don't like it's about like that I

00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,390
but the funding will impact us in the

00:43:43,569 --> 00:43:49,749
sense that you know if we're successful

00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:52,239
we can keep investing in Scala and for

00:43:49,749 --> 00:43:54,549
us the drive behind that and behind our

00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:58,630
team is I mean basically world

00:43:54,549 --> 00:44:00,849
domination for scholar right and making

00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,680
Scala popular and doing everything we

00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:04,450
can as we've been doing over the last

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,019
couple years ensuring stability between

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:10,859
releases having a story to tell to both

00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:14,170
the enterprise customer and a community

00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:16,989
so that we can that we can really you

00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:19,210
know keep pushing Scala forward a little

00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:23,079
bit slower than a little bit slower than

00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:25,299
then in the past but I think that's a

00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:27,880
feature I think Diana would like us to

00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:29,259
wrap up John so yeah those some will

00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,880
have one more one more question don't

00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:32,499
deserve it was a rhetorical question

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,450
which I'll give an honorable mention to

00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:35,979
which was hat how can anyone trust my

00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:41,529
library's my Cartman where i bought my

00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:44,890
socks but the the currently the

00:44:41,529 --> 00:44:48,099
currently trending question is other lee

00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:50,229
plans to make FP or cash consider a

00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:53,079
first class citizen in the scarlet

00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:56,099
standard library instead of in external

00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,539
libraries such as cats or scholar said

00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:00,190
so i've got the experience working on

00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:03,700
Scarlett said a couple years ago is

00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:06,729
really prolific contributor for a year

00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:10,210
or two and I know it had big a problem

00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:12,460
it is and how consuming a problem it is

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,930
to do a good job at that and I think the

00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:16,359
community is doing a pretty good job but

00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:18,849
try to come up with a coherent encoding

00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:20,319
of these concepts and it's not something

00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:24,849
that that we think we can do a better

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:27,489
job at so I don't I don't I know there

00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:30,660
are times when when I wish oh nice if we

00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:33,609
sort of had sort of a show type class or

00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:36,339
monotype class because we could extend

00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:39,099
out and library a little bit but there

00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:39,920
are certain difficulties with the way

00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:42,410
you

00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,319
ride the instances of these type classes

00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:47,390
that at the guys from cats and scholars

00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:49,430
adore are still innovating and trying to

00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,099
find find the right solutions for the

00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,960
best solutions for so I think the status

00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:56,089
quo is how we see things staying for now

00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,290
yeah so that said the most we will get

00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,530
the most benefit from keeping things

00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,869
outside the standard library evolving

00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:04,400
probably faster rate and like we've done

00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,619
for the other modules I think if

00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,619
anything happens to a library and it

00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:12,140
will not not if when it's making it

00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:14,660
smaller so that the community can can

00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:17,599
experiment and evolve and maintain and

00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,920
so on the flip side is that we we are

00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,180
looking at ways to make it easier for

00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,619
people to find libraries what they're

00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,770
looking for and that's one of the things

00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:25,809
that Skylar center is some he's trying

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:30,740
to do with the help of the community

00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:33,559
yeah absolutely that is all all the time

00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,510
we've got for questions so thank you

00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:38,420
everyone for coming I hope you've had a

00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:41,780
wonderful scala days can we we thank the
