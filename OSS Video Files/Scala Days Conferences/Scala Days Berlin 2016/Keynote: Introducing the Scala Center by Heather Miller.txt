Bio: 
Heather is a research scientist and the executive director of the Scala Center at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. She recently completed her PhD in EPFL’s School of Computer and Communication Science under Professor Martin Odersky, where she contributed to the now-widespread programming language, Scala. Heather’s research interests are at the intersection of data-centric distributed systems and programming languages, with a focus on transferring her research results into industrial use.

She now oversees the newly-established Scala Center, whose goal is to jointly to spearhead community open-source development on Scala, and to improve education surrounding Scala through a series of MOOCs.

I'm really excited to be here and to

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,599
present this this thing that we've

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,290
actually been working on trying to make

00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,480
exist for quite some time now so welcome

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,689
and let me introduce to you what this

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,670
Scala center thing is all about it's an

00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:24,449
organization that we've been trying to

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:28,949
it took us several months to create a DP

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,650
FL but first let's just point out like

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,340
the most important fact about this

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,719
organization we are a not-for-profit

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,430
establishment at EPFL I'll tell you what

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,430
EPFL is in a second if you don't know

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,559
oh it's sorry this is old it's been

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,500
launched about three months ago now so

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,239
we're about three months old and like I

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,680
said most important fact about this

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,670
whole thing is that we're not for profit

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,539
and EPFL is a university in switzerland

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,079
this is EPFL so we don't live where we

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,719
have nothing to do with San Francisco we

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,300
were not light bent or type safe we are

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,740
University in Switzerland and this is

00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,950
actually the inspiration behind the

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,780
Scala logo this is where Martin first

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,780
sort of came up with the original design

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,520
of Scala and it was this little academic

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,580
language that came out of this building

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,430
basically and so now we have a Center at

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,920
EPFL you might ask well alright we have

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,600
we have this company called light Bend

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,210
so why do we need a center now well

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,630
Scala is growing in popularity as Martin

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,370
rightly pointed out yesterday so as the

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,530
years roll on there are more and more

00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,930
job ads being posted and it just keeps

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,270
on sort of increasing at a sort of

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,910
ridiculous rate and actually what I

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,100
found that was kind of funny was that

00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,770
scholars even at the moment more popular

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,140
on indeed and job advertisements than

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,030
data scientists I mean I'd like to point

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,400
out there's a small probably a small

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,610
correlation between data scientist Scala

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,920
given given SPARC exists and I mean I I

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,080
believe Dean wampler and Andy Petrella

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,170
or just stingray I don't know they have

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,899
a talk talking about how and why this is

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,910
indeed true why skales the good the good

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,710
sort of lingua franca for data science

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,420
but anyway it's pretty cool so data

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,430
science is an exploding thing

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,840
and Scala seems to be exploding at

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,150
around the same rate that's pretty cool

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,710
it's also in this stack overflow

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,930
developer survey I don't know if you

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,220
guys saw this a lot of people have it's

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,350
very cool so basically Stack Overflow

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,470
did this this I mean I'm sure lots of

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:34,860
you probably gave responses to this to

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,510
this survey but over 50,000 people over

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,120
50 Salle's and developers participated

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,950
in this survey and Scala was one of it

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,830
came out as one of the top 5 most loved

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,510
languages so you know it's one that

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,400
actually gets fewer complaints despite

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,190
some of the some of the anger sometimes

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,570
Scala draws so still I still haven't

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:56,070
answered the question why should a

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,300
center exist well unlike other

00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,460
successful open source programming

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,130
languages we've never until now we've

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,720
ever had a not-for-profit sort of

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,120
gendered I'm sorry a vendor neutral

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,850
steward light vet does a really good job

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,960
of keeping the development and whatnot

00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,640
of stable style Scala going they they're

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,530
responsible for binary compatibility

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,970
happening that would have probably never

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,770
happened if everything stayed at EPFL

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:21,030
all by itself and all of us probably

00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,590
wouldn't be here today because it would

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,450
be really difficult to develop Scout to

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,070
develop projects on top of Scala if we

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,620
didn't have these wonderful binary and

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,790
sorts compatibility guarantees right but

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,100
like Ben can't spend all of their

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,750
development development cycles on sort

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,940
of free open-source development that by

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,400
itself doesn't pay the bills for for a

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,260
regular company to keep on going and not

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,740
only that but Scala is actually growing

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,810
beyond just the JVM by itself it's more

00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,330
than just the 2x compiler alone so now

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,580
we compile to JavaScript and soon well

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,080
sort of soon since we already you know

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,570
the Scala native project has been

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,590
announced and there's a it's been open

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,670
source we compiled two LLVM and of

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,770
course if you'd like to hear more about

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,920
that i think dennis has a talk I'm not

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,600
sure if it's today or tomorrow but still

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,860
we need to broaden our focus and open up

00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,930
Scala to some more

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm sorry open up open up more of

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,440
skylights and more of Scala stakeholders

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,150
we need somebody to deal with some of

00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,530
this stuff

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,080
libraries are kind of important nobody's

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:21,180
been really focusing on on you know

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,940
making sure that the standard library is

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,760
is you know clean and taken care of as

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,449
much as it needs to be so there needs to

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,250
be more effort invested

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,319
and sort of all of this open source

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,789
important stuff that we all need but

00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,069
when one company can't do it all by

00:04:33,789 --> 00:04:38,979
itself so the Scylla Center aims to be

00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:42,039
something that can help in some of these

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:45,039
spaces right so we have two goals at the

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:46,900
Scylla Center this is really kind of

00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:48,879
I'll show you the mission statement in a

00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,340
second but number one were focused on

00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,039
open source open source community and

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,349
number two education but I'd like to

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,560
really highlight that when I say

00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:01,150
community we mean really sorry we mean

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,919
really everybody community means

00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,349
everybody community means enormous

00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,150
company that has a thousand scholar

00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,669
developers that's on some old version of

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,569
scala community also means some

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:15,099
brilliant weekend tinkerer playing

00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:16,780
around with some academic ideas

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:18,699
published in an oleg paper and

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,620
translating them to scholar like this is

00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:22,210
everybody everybody is the community so

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,250
the scala Center has a non profit

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,629
not-for-profit non-profit Stewart is

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,900
committed to acting in the interest of

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:31,930
every side of this of this this of this

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,509
world of Scala and just to read the

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,880
mission statement that we were sort of

00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:38,469
founded under so independently guide and

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,150
support the entire Skylar community

00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:42,190
independently means that we are not

00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,750
controlled by any one company we do not

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,759
do things one company tells us to do

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,979
it's for the good of everybody literally

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,479
all the time and to coordinating develop

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,190
open source libraries and tools for the

00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,080
benefit of the overall scala community

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,270
so again for everybody and to provide

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,819
deep quality and freely available

00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,080
educational materials for scallop since

00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:01,479
we're founded at a university it's

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,080
rather important that we do educational

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:08,740
things universities like to do right so

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,690
this is our mission statement and I'll

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,940
just iterate through the what I mean by

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:18,069
these two things but first I'll start

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,509
with education so I believe probably a

00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:23,580
lot of people are familiar with these

00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:25,840
MOOCs that we've founded back in 2012

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,460
there were two of them first there was

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,940
this MOOC called prog fund and then

00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,529
there was a MOOC called reactive and

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,960
until now those two MOOCs that were on

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:37,509
this old version of Coursera had up to I

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,979
had over 400,000 people registered to

00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:40,700
take them and they also had the highest

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:43,040
completion rates

00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,250
across all MOOCs that grew to their size

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,680
each iteration had between 40 and 60

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,240
thousand students enrolled and in this

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,680
these MOOCs actually served as the main

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,050
free educational resource for learning

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,380
Scala pretty in-depth automated

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,840
programming grading and all of that and

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,110
here's just a little plot that I like to

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,720
show sometimes this is an up-to-date

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,790
graph from this website here basically

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,290
this is a researcher who's keeping an

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:11,780
eye on what's going on in the world of

00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,900
MOOCs and our MOOC is actually right

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,020
here so on the on the x-axis of this

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,820
graph this is the size of people

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,410
enrolled in the MOOC so here is zero

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,690
hundred thousand two hundred thousand

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,060
and this is the completion rate so as

00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,380
you can see as MOOCs get bigger fewer

00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,510
and fewer people complete the course but

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,520
when they stay really small around half

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:36,470
of people complete the course so we're

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,330
here so of all MOOCs in the in the 50 60

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,770
thousand student range we have really

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,600
the highest completion rate at around 20

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,170
percent so that's that's really

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,080
impressive

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:48,500
so our MOOCs seem to be rather popular

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,880
and widely loved so well what's the

00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,520
first thing we do as part of the Scala

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,680
Center we offer a new scalloped mini

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,570
degree that is offered in partnership

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,930
with Coursera it's composed of four

00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,940
courses two of them are new so of the

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,770
first two courses are sort of

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,200
reorganized material from the other two

00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,820
courses that have already been published

00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,230
in the last few years but these two new

00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,360
courses I'll cover in a moment and

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,900
there's a something called a capstone

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,760
project which is a four to five week

00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,470
significant project it's a programming a

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,600
site like a programming assignment so

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,150
it's more like a kind of like a thesis

00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,500
project in some sense so it's not if you

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,800
if you've taken any of the other MOOCs

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,780
before you have usually like one one

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,460
Scala file or two Scala files and you

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,310
implement some methods you fill in some

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,900
nets to method definitions right this is

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:39,020
going to be a much bigger sort of

00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,400
programming assignment and another cool

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,320
thing about these MOOCs that we're

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,450
launching or we just we actually just

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,910
launched is that we're doing it on this

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,620
new platform which is a great this new

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,040
Coursera platform which is a great

00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,680
improvement over the last version it's

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,020
very much more modern

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,030
and also it's I'm not sure if this is

00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,000
the correct term for what it is it's

00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:02,740
basically on demand which means that you

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,990
can enroll in the course today start

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,630
taking the course today they have

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:10,450
something called cohorts where you if

00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:12,040
you enroll today you are in a cohort of

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,510
other learners that enrolled in the same

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,520
two-week period so you're all taking the

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,920
course together and every two weeks they

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,420
have new cohorts so III it's a little

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,590
bit confusing the terminology if you log

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,300
on to the website not sure if it's

00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,760
called on-demand or a session or

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,080
whatever but though the bottom line is

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,840
that you don't have to wait six months

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,910
for the next rerun of this course it's

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,950
basically always running so you can

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,230
start this course whenever you want

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,730
today tomorrow two weeks from now three

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,350
months you're it's always going to be

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,460
available always going to be running and

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:46,090
other people should be taking it

00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:47,770
alongside of you in addition to that so

00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:49,750
this whole what I'd what I mentioned

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,120
that this was a mini degree on Coursera

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,760
they called a specialization this is

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,740
what it looks like so you might see that

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,230
it costs some money to enroll in some of

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,300
these these courses but but what you

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,770
should walk away with right now is that

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:06,570
it's still for free

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:08,590
Coursera is trying to you know return on

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,380
investments that have been made but

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,240
basically they offer a paid certificate

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,120
where they verify your identity

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:20,560
etc and that that is that is available

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,000
for a fee yet you can still find if you

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,620
if you go to the individual course pages

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,260
you can still enroll in all this stuff

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,490
for free so just be aware it's it's

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,520
still for free just without the

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,340
certificate and as Martin mentioned

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,600
yesterday we still we still do the

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,790
automated grading and our automated

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,740
grading is being you know is being used

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,660
in the the upcoming two courses in

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,140
addition in the in the final capstone

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,490
project so I mean this is actually we've

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,060
actually did like a little study and we

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,860
found that these automated graders

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,410
really are a big part of the retention

00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,150
of our courses people really participate

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,470
and come back because of these automated

00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,790
graders so you'll be happy to know that

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,070
we're not getting rid of them we're

00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,740
improving them and we're developing them

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,720
for all of our courses basically and if

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,250
you haven't taken the course already we

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,150
check not only for the correctness of

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,380
your code

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,240
did you consider all the corner cases

00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,920
did you did you do everything that the

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,270
assignment asked you to do but we also

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,710
check for style we run it through a

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,320
little style checker to tell you say hey

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,110
don't use VARs don't don't cast anything

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,320
you can use a pattern match for example

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,910
these are the four courses so course one

00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,400
this functional programming principles

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,930
in Scala course is a subset of the

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,850
original prog fund course there's

00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,760
nothing really different from it

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,400
number two is bits and pieces of the

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,650
reactive course and the rest of the

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,360
material from prog fun so if you've

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,640
taken reactive and if you've taken prog

00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,730
fun basically that's a superset of

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,260
course one and two and we've actually

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,450
got confirmation from Coursera that if

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,460
you did pay for a certificate for either

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,620
of these two courses that you will have

00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,080
credit transferred over so you shouldn't

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,720
have to pay again just so you know this

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,160
is finally resolved and the new the two

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,840
new courses are called parallel

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,960
programming and big data analysis in

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,740
spark and Scala or skaaland spark

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,960
parallel programming is taught by a

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,150
professor Victor kucik and Alex broke a

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,370
pets who is the guy who authored

00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,750
parallel collections some years ago and

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,790
I'm teaching this course on big data

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,680
analysis and Scala and spark I'll go

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,260
into kind of what these courses cover in

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,610
a moment so first if you haven't taken

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,740
the the functional programming

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,510
principles in Scala course the idea

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,290
behind this course is really to cover

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,480
the basic sort of kind of ground level

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,650
concepts and functional programming the

00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,270
teacher had a write some purely

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,500
functional programs using recursion

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,040
pattern matching in higher order

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,540
functions it's also actually Martin also

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,270
teaches how to combine functional

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,040
programming with objects and classes how

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,590
to design immutable data structures and

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,040
how to reason about functions and he

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,840
goes a little bit into you know types in

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,550
the second part of the course I told you

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,940
this was a little bit of a mixture of

00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,220
reactive and and prog fun so the idea of

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,450
course number two it's called functional

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,030
program design in Scala

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,340
the idea is to recognize and apply these

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,930
design principles and apply them to

00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,930
little functional programs to design

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,360
functional libraries and api's and we we

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,320
also add we add some stuff from the

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,120
world of functional reactive

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,120
applications so we do things like

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,089
futures and whatnot this is all in this

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,120
course so for expressions

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:26,279
lazy evaluation and timely effects so

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,559
the the bit from reactive about futures

00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:33,209
is in here and the new courses so they

00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,259
actually kind of connect to one another

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:40,740
so if you notice they're both about some

00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:42,600
kind of parallelism so in this course

00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,120
and parallel programming we start with

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,100
past parallelism and go into Darryl data

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,319
parallelism Aleks broker pets has

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,360
written this book which is pretty good I

00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:54,240
really enjoy it actually I highly

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,800
recommend it and the idea is that we

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
teach we start with with task

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,439
parallelism get into data parallelism

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,110
and and we we go from just sort of the

00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,610
basic definitions and some basic like

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,379
task parallel algorithms to data

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,959
parallel algorithms explain sort of how

00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:13,050
Scala collection of parallel collections

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,540
are designed how you can design sort of

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:17,670
data parallel things like Scala parallel

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,040
collections and then just general data

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,649
structures for parallel computing and

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,930
the fourth course is actually it

00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:26,509
actually connects to the the parallel

00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,279
programming course so they're basically

00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:30,329
sort of a prerequisite the parallel

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,529
programming course is a prerequisite a

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,420
little bit to the data program at the

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,800
data analysis course in spark the idea

00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,259
is well now that we've taught you what

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,730
data parallelism is and how it works now

00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,259
we're going to map all of those concepts

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,370
to the distributed case because you just

00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:45,059
learned everything in the shared memory

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:47,399
case so we that's the approach we take

00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:48,540
we go through the basics of Sparx

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,220
program the model and we get into a

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,889
little bit of the nitty-gritty so how do

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,209
for example sparks how does the parks

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,230
programming model differ from the

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:57,389
familiar programming models that you're

00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,740
already used to like Scala regular

00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,959
sequential collections or parallel

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,569
collections when things are shared in

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,759
shared memory how does it work and we

00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,800
also explain a little bit how to express

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,420
some some algorithms that you'd like to

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,220
use in the world of data analysis and a

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,839
functional style and then we go a little

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,949
bit into the some of the advanced things

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,800
that you should care about and spark

00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:18,959
like how not to to shuffle data how to

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,839
avoid things like that because the

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,660
benefits of using spark can be quickly

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,410
eclipsed by accidentally introducing

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,439
re-evaluations of lineages or

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,309
unnecessary shuffles in in some some

00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:31,740
algorithm that you're trying to

00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,560
implement so those are the four courses

00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,779
they already started they started

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,750
about two weeks ago to three weeks ago

00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,790
in in at the end of May and we're

00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:44,310
expecting course number four and the

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,020
capstone hopefully sometime in July or

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,330
late summer so this is all in the

00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,220
pipeline it's coming and what's really

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:53,670
cool is already in the first three weeks

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,800
we have 60 about 63 thousand registered

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,860
learners so these I mean these are

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,270
people who just free mostly vast

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,070
majority of them are free and it's

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,110
growing so it's really cool a lot of

00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:07,320
people are finding value in these

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,810
courses and sort of a big goal of the

00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,460
Scala Center and why EPFL decided okay

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,140
it's a good place we should have the

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,730
Scala Center here is so that we can

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,410
ensure that these MOOCs continue going

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,140
there are a lot of work to maintain and

00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,089
build up okay so MOOCs

00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,380
let's we're done with the educational

00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:27,390
side of things let's talk about open

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:30,450
source so as a sort of a bottom line

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,860
footnote on the side of open source and

00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,230
Scala I think a lot of things can be

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,720
improved and the Scala Center concretely

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:40,110
seeks to improve the landscape of

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,930
scholars libraries we am an explicit

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,420
goal is to grow our community to grow

00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,610
our ecosystem to court and to coordinate

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,080
and direct any sort of open source

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,970
developments of library - or tools

00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,730
libraries or tools that are broad

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,589
benefit to everybody so things that we

00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,350
all need and care about we want to make

00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,970
sure that they don't go anywhere and of

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,920
course also to provide scaffolding to

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,990
help the community develop publish find

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:10,260
and evaluate Scala libraries before I

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,839
give you an example of what I mean by

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,760
this last point I want to just go a

00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,610
little bit further into this sort of

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,380
philosophy that we have why did I

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:22,319
mention a moment ago that we want to

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,030
grow these little communities of

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,060
open-source developers and how do we how

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,980
do we expect to grow our ecosystem and

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,350
what not so we want to start with some

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,330
of the projects that we're we're

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,560
developing in-house and we want to do

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:39,090
this with other people so so far I'm

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,760
gonna go through two projects that that

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,130
we're working on at the moment but we

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,240
want to be responsible for for managing

00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,980
a handful of sort of important

00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,270
initiatives and to ensure that things

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,070
like hardware infrastructure

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,900
is available for projects that are of

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,870
broad importance to the whole community

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,940
and that projects maintain you know some

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,310
sort of management and that larger goal

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,840
but goals can be broken into pieces and

00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,120
the contributors can figure out how to

00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,840
participate and help these goals along

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:10,260
and we do this by for projects that we

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,230
we would like to insure our you know

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,660
exist in our continued for for at least

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,360
some period of time we dedicate one to

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,580
two Scala Center staff members to engage

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,620
and participate and help the development

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,690
of certain projects and and really the

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,260
important point is that we don't want to

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,760
be the people who control everything we

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,080
want to give the control also to the

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,970
contributors that are participating in

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,190
the project we want this to be a

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,890
community effort and people to come and

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,830
get involved in some of the projects

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,710
that we're working on so we do this by

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:46,290
trying to organize little little groups

00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,090
of contributors that work together on

00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,820
growing something that we can all depend

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,130
on so we're this is all an experiment it

00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:56,250
may not work we may fail several times

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,350
at trying to achieve this goal but right

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:01,110
now the way that we're doing it is we

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,160
are just that we've started so far with

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,510
two of the projects that we're working

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,490
on we're really more just one because

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,900
we're focusing on one at the moment so

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,940
you have weekly 30-minute project

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,550
meetings dedicated slack channel per

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,870
project so people who come and go who

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,850
wants to contribute hey I want to

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,430
contribute this small thing they they

00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,930
join our little group we discuss things

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:21,660
in this channel we maybe have a meeting

00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:24,120
they spend an afternoon or an evening or

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,100
a couple of days adding something and

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,330
then maybe they disappear again but we

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,650
want to add have some sort of

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,420
scaffolding and some sort of structure

00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,330
for people to participate in these

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,600
projects and it's working actually so

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,600
far

00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:44,340
oh I expect I have the slides out of

00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:46,499
order it's working so far and we're

00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,409
gonna I'm going to show you in a few

00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:50,999
moments the the sort of the first big

00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:53,789
initiative that we've taken on which is

00:19:50,999 --> 00:19:56,879
called the Scala package indexer Scala

00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:59,460
decks for short but since we're talking

00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:01,499
about social organizing and whatnot I

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,169
want to go a little bit more into also

00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:07,019
how we exist because there's probably a

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,019
lot of big questions about how how this

00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:11,609
funding happened and how do we actually

00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:13,499
maintain some sort of independence and

00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:14,519
how do we you know how is it possible

00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:16,230
for me to say out where that we're not

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,779
for profit and we're getting money from

00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,720
people right so the way that that we

00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:23,309
were founded was EPFL since they wanted

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,559
these MOOCs to exist they provided seed

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,259
funding for two people to be employed by

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,230
the Scala Center and beyond that any any

00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:33,539
income that we get from industrial

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,489
members of the Scala Center we can hire

00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,739
with the money that that is donated to

00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:40,970
us so we have basically only two

00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:43,679
possible ways to earn any money one is

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,809
donations and the other is any sort of

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,730
revenue share that comes from the MOOCs

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,679
that pays for our staff members to exist

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,289
that's it this is this is all the money

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,239
this is how is it's how were funded and

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:54,899
and really John John said it really

00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:57,600
nicely

00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:59,399
John pretty helped me draft some of

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,379
these documents he said it really nicely

00:20:59,399 --> 00:21:02,669
one of our and one of our documents so

00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:04,169
I'm just going to read it to you because

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,850
you know nobody can say things better

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:07,470
nobody can explain things better than

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,369
John I think so the Scalla Center has

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,590
been created as an independent

00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:12,239
not-for-profit organization within EPFL

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,980
the independent our independence comes

00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:15,210
our independence from commercial

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,710
interest is protected by the statute

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,059
through the swiss federal restriction

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,739
that our funding must be made as

00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,029
charitable donations in order for us to

00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:23,190
receive contributions in their entirety

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,590
not linked to any particular initiative

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,909
this is a rule that's given down to us

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,730
from the University we can't just take

00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:32,489
money from anybody and this so as a

00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,960
result sort of this these strict sort of

00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:36,029
funding rules from being within the

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,409
university ensures objectivity and

00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,970
accountability for our decision-making

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,830
and allows us to focus on our overall

00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,809
mission which is to benefit people in

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,639
general and not to try and make money

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:47,179
and ensure that funding is coming in all

00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:49,440
the time so it's really for everybody

00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,639
and so you might ask okay well companies

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,200
are giving money what did they get for

00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,860
it I mean you got to give them something

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,559
right

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,000
well no it's a donation what we we

00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,950
provide for this money is the right to

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,500
stay in the loop guarantee that we're

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,330
going to make progress with this money

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,309
somehow that is of the benefit of

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,710
everybody and we define exactly what

00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:09,510
that means and the ability to make

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:11,909
recommendations about what they think is

00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,340
important so we want to listen to

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:16,140
organizations that contribute to us but

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,850
we're not required to act on every

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,490
single thing that they that they tell us

00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,990
to do I don't want to go into a lot of

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,429
detail about this because I think it

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,769
starts getting boring real fast

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:27,179
but John John pretty run up a really

00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:28,620
nice blog article which I would suggest

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,510
if you're curious and you want to know

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,880
more he answers a lot of questions about

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,320
how this process works and about how our

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,940
first advisory board meeting went in

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,159
this blog article that he posted on

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,630
Scala Lang org so if you're interested

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
in and seeing more about how this works

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,429
head over to Scala and look at the blog

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,720
but we had this thing called the

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,779
advisory board and we have these

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,860
meetings and like I said the advisory

00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,539
board has the right to give us

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,000
recommendations or suggest things how we

00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,389
how we should invest our energies and

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,340
and this advisory board is made up of

00:22:56,389 --> 00:23:01,200
people from the scylla Center people

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,299
from this the the scallop community

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,549
right now there's just one we're hoping

00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,200
to grow that to a second Scala community

00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:09,389
member so that you know people that

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,519
aren't just paying members can have a

00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:14,220
voice as well and then these corporate

00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,019
representatives who say well look we

00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,519
have all of our infrastructure built on

00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,889
Scala we really want to make sure that

00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,139
things continue to improve for the

00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:24,029
entire Scala ecosystem so we would like

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,070
to contribute to this pot of money to

00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,840
hire for open source initiatives in

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,880
Scala and that's sort of how it all

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,590
works and when we have these meetings we

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,179
discussed the Scala center's progress on

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,190
the initiatives that we've undertaken

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,630
that we've started working on and then

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,850
we also discussed together areas of

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,519
concern that might need attention and

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,870
and you know we all together discuss and

00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,309
vote on what we think is really the most

00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,649
important for everybody to benefit not

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:47,700
just one company or one industry and in

00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:49,710
order for anybody to make any

00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,260
recommendation it has to any

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,360
recommendation made has to satisfy this

00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,220
condition that really whatever you

00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,500
recommend has to be of general interest

00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,519
and for everybody right so and we're

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,350
also committed to being fully

00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,630
transparent if you're interested in

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,710
seeing our agendas our minutes and

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,780
proposals that are submitted

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,300
or recommendations by the advisory board

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,970
it's on this repository so Scala Center

00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,170
slash advisory board on github and we

00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,320
published the minutes from our last

00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:19,320
meeting so you can see a great summary

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,790
of who literally what everybody said

00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,400
what what you know the different

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,990
industrial members care about so you on

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,410
you know what we're doing there's no

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,170
secrets and at the end of this meeting

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,090
we had three three recommendations which

00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,280
we all agreed including the people at

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,780
Scott's endure that these are important

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,060
things that we should invest our money

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:41,680
and effort on first thing was improving

00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,290
the governance of the community

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,210
processes around Scala there are some

00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:49,000
ways that we can improve this basically

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,080
making sure that all stips and slips so

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,280
these are the skyline improvement

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,930
proposals in the Scylla improvement

00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,780
documents to make sure that all of these

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:58,090
things are treated carefully and in a

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,940
timely manner so that's that step number

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,990
one and we've already begun doing that

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,990
we've already hired for for for this for

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:09,520
this for this initiative and we also the

00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,170
next the next important initiative that

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,060
was brought up to us was well hey

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,720
there's this da D thing that's looming

00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,790
on the horizon

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,430
has anybody figured out how people with

00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:20,320
Scala code bases are going to go to dot

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,580
E or Scala 3 or whatever you want to

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,350
call it code bases eventually there

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,630
should be some some migration paths or

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,360
some sort of tool defined that was

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,550
another suggestion we agreed well yeah a

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,470
lot of a lot of our our energy is going

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:34,450
into this da d thing existing so we

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,150
should probably begin to care about how

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,460
people who have code bases now might

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,980
eventually want to migrate and develop

00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,930
some tools for that and a third

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,520
recommendation was hey make sure that

00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,470
Scala GS doesn't die it's a really cool

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,540
project and a lot of companies are

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,610
beginning to really depend on it so I

00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,260
think that probably everybody can agree

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,510
that these things are not in the

00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,670
interest of any one company I mean

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,770
actually this is really cool that this

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,790
sip and slip process was unanimously

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,490
voted as something that should be

00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,080
improved that means that like the

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,970
corporate members as well as community

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,620
people and the rest of us just sitting

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,230
in the room we're like yes this needs to

00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,530
be improved we need to find a way for

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,940
for this process to work for everybody

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:18,310
and so you might ask okay well what

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,030
about like Bend and typesafe well that's

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,220
easy it's an easy

00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:23,320
question to answer we actually we work

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,360
together we work orthogonal II so

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,460
nothing will change about about the

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,990
stable scholar release Scala will be

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,780
Arab sorry light Ben will continue to

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,600
maintain the stable the stable Scala

00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,860
distribution but we will start first

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,510
with libraries in the Scala ecosystem so

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:42,040
to stay orthogonal other areas of

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:44,140
interest that we might eventually focus

00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,540
on include things like dotty and

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,060
alternate backends likes college is in

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,340
Scala native but right now sort of a

00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,580
main focus of the Scala Center should be

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,260
in the direction of trying to work in

00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,450
sort of the ecosystem and libraries and

00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,410
and and work alongside of the people

00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,320
that like them because they're doing

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,060
really a lot for us all as a community

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,030
so alright that's that's I think I think

00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,530
that was I think if you're interested in

00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:10,690
more you should come up and talk to me

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:12,700
about how this process works if I if I

00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,900
haven't clarified something fully we

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,130
also have lots of documents posted

00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,080
online so like please go into detail to

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,400
those ask me questions whatever you'd

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,110
like but I'd like to actually go into

00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,160
some of the fun stuff now some of the

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,640
fun stuff that we've been working on

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,100
lately

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,210
so first let's let's talk about some of

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,690
the projects that we've gotten started

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:33,160
with so I have a question that probably

00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,320
people already know the answer to now

00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:41,650
what to node Haskell and rust having to

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:43,990
have in common that Scala doesn't well

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,810
okay it's a packaged index or manager

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,460
but whatever we have both of all of

00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,380
these whatever you want to call them

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,990
languages I don't know note is not a

00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,900
language but whatever projects all of

00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:59,290
these things have have some way of

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,050
figuring out you know what other things

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:04,570
exist in the in the ecosystem we don't

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,980
we're a pretty popular language now and

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:07,390
we have no way of really finding other

00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,460
libraries other than just searching

00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,960
github searching mailing lists looking

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,880
for getter channels asking Stack

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,280
Overflow what's the best library for XYZ

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,650
it would be really cool if we could just

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:21,400
see what people publish without without

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,960
sort of a AV investment in sort of like

00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,130
going around and selling your library

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,710
having to be made if you've made

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,700
something useful we should all be able

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,250
to find it and use it

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,409
right you shouldn't have to go travel

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,240
the world and like tell people my thing

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,289
is so cool tried to use it use it it

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,610
shouldn't be required if you do

00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,470
something useful in your free time and

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,899
it could benefit a lot of people we

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,809
should be able to find it somehow so we

00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:46,870
want to give people who make great

00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:48,789
things of waste without the need to you

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,529
know really market their stuff so much

00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:53,559
so the first thing that we we've started

00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:57,370
with is a project called Scala Dex and

00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,830
actually so I'm gonna call Guillaume

00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:03,340
masae who built most of this along with

00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:06,159
John I don't know if John's around he's

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,340
gonna walk you through it real quick but

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,830
basically the the high-level summary is

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,809
that Scala Dex is a package indexed a

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,460
map of the entire known Scala ecosystem

00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:18,519
and it's based importantly it's based

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,980
off of published Scala artifacts so we

00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:25,419
don't index github we index published

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:28,480
artifacts we index palms from from

00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:30,700
actually bin tray and we connect these

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,279
palms with info we get from places like

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,559
github and eventually Stack Overflow so

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,120
we're trying to tie these different

00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,340
sources of data together and give

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,899
everybody one clear place where they can

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:45,309
come to to find Scylla libraries and so

00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:47,919
we've done this like I said by crawling

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:51,130
bin tray and linking basically to github

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,769
and we've actually we do have a nice UI

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,600
now these are the group this is a group

00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,769
of people who have worked on it and I

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,750
would like to ask you um to come

00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:01,840
actually walk us through it a little bit

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:04,299
it's now actually live and you can all

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,049
access it right now today it's open

00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:09,909
source and this is this is what lips oh

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:12,210
no hold on one second this is what it

00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:12,210
looks like

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,680
and I'd like to point out I'm gonna

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,330
going a little bit more detail about how

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,310
this worked out but this beautiful

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,340
interface was contributed by 47 degrees

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:27,990
so I'd really like to again thank them

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,990
for this I mean look at how pretty it is

00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,750
hey Holly

00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,510
as software developers who are like

00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:41,320
magician we create libraries out of thin

00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:43,750
air but unlike them we share our tricks

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:49,410
so this is where we can share our tricks

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,410
I'll show you neat things we can find

00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,730
all right on the main page you have the

00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,940
search bar if you know what you're

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,050
looking for or if you're not you don't

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,230
know what you're looking for you can

00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:06,880
look through the tagging system so we

00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:10,210
have different keywords like if you're

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:16,270
looking for a way to to parse a Jason

00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:19,840
HTTP libraries etc and then for the most

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:22,240
recent artifacts we index we are the

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,240
most recent project they are available

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,390
on the front page a project it's

00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:34,300
something it's like you get a repository

00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:36,820
so we have three levels of things so the

00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,220
first thing is it's a project and then

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:42,550
we have an artifact so like a project

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:45,040
would be type level cats and artifact

00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:47,680
would be something like cats core and

00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,890
then you have a release a release its

00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,650
equivalent to a pond so it's like a

00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:57,010
published version so cats core version

00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,520
zero point six point zero four s College

00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:04,330
s

00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:07,870
0.6 for example that's a release so this

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:12,070
is a list of recent release and when

00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:17,320
really cool thing I found is you look

00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:23,139
more and the second page

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:28,809
I found out that spire just released a

00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:31,870
new version so they release recently the

00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:34,630
two 2.0 preview and I found it out with

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,409
the Scala index another nice thing that

00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,909
you can do its search a specific

00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:42,880
specific project and then look it's

00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:45,009
reverse dependencies or dependent our

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:51,659
libraries that depends on on this

00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:51,659
library one example of it is Acker HTTP

00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:06,970
oh yeah if you don't if you don't see

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:11,929
what you're looking for you can sort

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:19,399
with a various sorting mechanism star is

00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:27,009
the one that is useful so like I should

00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:27,009
be it's under Akana oh it's pretty hard

00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,739
so here it's the different level of okay

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,320
so this is the project page on the left

00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:44,539
do you see the project and on the right

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,580
you see the two level I was talking

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:50,360
about so the artifact and then the

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,580
release now I select I select an

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,389
artifact and I can select a specific

00:33:52,580 --> 00:34:00,710
release so I'm interested into that for

00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:03,590
that and you can look through the

00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,179
dependent there's lots of them and one

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,750
of them for example it's it's a

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:12,440
BitTorrent client I really didn't expect

00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:15,740
it and you can find like lots of pretty

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,020
neat libraries that that are Aiden true

00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,290
to the dependent so that's affirmative

00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,290
moe

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:25,220
so there's this thanks Kim so there's

00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,339
there's this is this is basically

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:31,069
version one of the package index there's

00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:33,379
still a few things that we're working on

00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,909
eventually so this this is not working

00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:37,339
today it'll be working in I don't know a

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,909
couple of days the idea is that you can

00:34:37,339 --> 00:34:43,359
log in using your github authenticate

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:45,950
layer your github ID and you can

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,270
basically if you are a contributor on

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,369
libraries you should be you'll be able

00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,129
to tag libraries and say okay this is

00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:54,339
this fits into the category of parsing

00:34:52,129 --> 00:34:57,079
or this fits into the category of

00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:58,430
generic programming or you can there's a

00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,440
number of categories that you can choose

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,740
from and if you're a contributor on a

00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,500
library you can tag libraries and help

00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:09,589
us categorize things that maybe aren't

00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:13,520
super easy to index other things that

00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:16,480
are eventually coming so we have so

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,740
there so this is a this is a mock-up of

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,480
the UI and there's a few more things

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:22,700
that we're connecting so you're going to

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,549
be able to find a bunch of statistics

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:29,119
that you get from github we do already

00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:34,180
show the library so we figured out how

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,180
to we figured out

00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:44,010
you're different this place okay so we

00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,050
so here I mean you can you know add your

00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:49,860
your projects dependencies that SBT we

00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:56,870
also have the Scala doc or that's the

00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:56,870
Java doc oh no oh no this is horrible

00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,560
okay well that link is broke and we'll

00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:04,430
have to fix that but basically there's a

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,830
there's a service there's a service

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:10,110
called Java dot IO that basically

00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:13,410
collects all of the the documentation

00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,510
artifacts and we make a request to them

00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:18,720
and link up all of our libraries with

00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:21,120
the API Doc's so this will be resolved

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,120
soon but basically it will link to all

00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,820
of the Scala doc all the Scala decks

00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:32,010
that are also published so okay we have

00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:33,540
these licenses and dependencies and over

00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,280
here we have a few more things that are

00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,350
coming basically things like

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,920
contributors these keywords stuff will

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:43,080
be editable soon but and one last thing

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,450
we're trying to figure out a nice little

00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,950
badge system to let project indicate

00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,540
when contributors are really wanted

00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,400
sometimes people publish a project and

00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,680
they say look I'm just publishing this

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,780
for people to see so we're going to try

00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,480
and find a way for people to indicate

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,760
sort of how open to contributions

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,840
different libraries are so people who

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,690
are looking to get involved in

00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,400
open-source go to the right sort of

00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:08,100
really excited to have contributors

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,350
libraries efforts like cats which I'm

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,050
really amazed at how many how many

00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:15,540
contributors this group by the type of

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,900
people have managed to to to pull in

00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,910
behind these projects okay that's all

00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,860
I'm going to show on that front

00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,500
this is all available sorry I didn't

00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:28,290
tell you what the URL was it's indexed

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,420
at Scala Lang org as you can see we're

00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:32,580
working on it changing as we go we're

00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,220
we're basically indexing at this point

00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,870
about every day and if you want to get

00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,440
involved actually right now if you want

00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:42,330
to do something to help out if you after

00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,580
this talk you end up on this on this

00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:47,460
library I'm sorry on this on the package

00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,420
index you can and you find that maybe

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,160
your library isn't tagged

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:54,099
and that you would like to contribute a

00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,470
tag we have a couple of meta data

00:37:54,099 --> 00:37:58,690
repositories under the scholar under the

00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:00,819
Scala Center organization on github in

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,069
particular this one here it's called

00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:05,829
Scala Scala dekstop made of data until

00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:06,309
that edit button is available you can at

00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:09,849
any time

00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:11,770
help us by by contributing tags to the

00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:14,529
different libraries we have at this

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,660
point we've indexed around 3,000 scholar

00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:18,279
projects which include within the

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,039
projects of themselves many artifacts

00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:24,039
and whatnot so that's that's the Scala

00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,170
the Scala index or Scala decks and as I

00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,690
as I mentioned this this has been one of

00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:31,150
these efforts where we involve a bunch

00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,470
of people who have just come to us and

00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,750
said I want to try and help out somehow

00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,809
and that includes this really huge

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,970
contribution from 47° for this this this

00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:42,190
UI we totally didn't expect it and we

00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:46,960
really profited all of us together

00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:49,150
having this wonderful UI to use so I

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,839
mean we can take this idea a lot further

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:54,069
so not just using this this idea of you

00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:55,990
know so we had this idea of dependence

00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:57,400
to show how widely use the library is

00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:59,020
how many other libraries depend on it

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,880
but we can also to think about doing

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,680
other things like parsing build files

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,230
and displaying important bits of

00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:07,660
information like when libraries click on

00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,730
this experimental flag and we can also

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:13,000
you know we show the licensing

00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,859
information up front and we can also

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,069
like another idea that we've had with

00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:20,910
the Scala team at lifeand is to

00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:24,910
potentially use this this this this

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:27,460
Scala index to build larger swaths of

00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,410
the Scala the Scala ecosystem to have

00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,109
not just the Scala canoes evil but even

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,460
like the idea of a scalloped ecosystem

00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:36,430
build we can build more and more

00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,950
projects potentially this way by maybe

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,079
using this API that the Scala index

00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,460
provides so that's that's the first

00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,770
project that we've been working on in

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,809
the last couple of months other

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,520
initiatives on the radar that we hope to

00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:52,180
pick up next Martin mentioned this idea

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:57,700
of separating the Scala library jar into

00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:59,260
a core and platform so now that the

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,190
compiler has stabilized our libraries

00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,470
have also kind of frozen along with

00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,480
and it would be really cool to sort of

00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,880
as the Scala compiler team has already

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,800
been doing be continuing to take things

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,100
out modular izing this the standard

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:16,130
library but to enable people to have a

00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,730
batteries included sort of idea of a

00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:22,910
platform right so we might ship for

00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:25,610
example like an EPFL platform something

00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,270
bad or rather whatever some some sort of

00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,780
Scala

00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:32,600
- platform jar which includes a small

00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:34,340
collection of libraries that fit into

00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,320
this idea of a platform kind of like the

00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:38,930
idea the Haskell platform a little bit

00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,270
and so must have libraries can maybe be

00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:44,180
in this thing and other groups who have

00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,470
you know other other sort of like no we

00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:47,810
don't like that library that library is

00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:50,210
not so important to us they can release

00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,740
a different set of libraries so I know

00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,210
that the type level folks are probably

00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,190
like to have a type level platform for

00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,290
example so we want to open this up to

00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:59,930
everybody and make this a little bit

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,300
easier to sort of package kind of like

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,310
what's really essential in your projects

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,630
so this is a next important sort of step

00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,130
that we're going to eventually take and

00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:10,010
then after the the Scala

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,590
the scallop packaged index we're going

00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,110
to once we sort of finish resolving

00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,660
loose ends there we're going to invest a

00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:20,980
lot more effort into this idea of a

00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:23,900
Scala fiddle so if you guys know a

00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,900
jsfiddle which works like this you write

00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,610
some HTML some CSS and some JavaScript

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,920
and then you can run it in the browser

00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:32,930
on the same view we want to create

00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,790
something like that for Scala so it

00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:38,600
would be really cool if people could on

00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:40,640
Stack Overflow use this tool that well

00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,260
this there's a few contributors have

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,150
have worked on actually different tools

00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,770
and we want to somehow combine and the

00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:47,780
great things that come from all of these

00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:49,400
different tools but right now it's

00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,960
called Scala fiddle and this this

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,170
version that I'm showing you is by auto

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,480
cons who has this actually running

00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,820
online you can use it as it is right now

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,910
and use the Scala GS under the hood and

00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:04,400
so we would like to as a next step work

00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,570
on something called Scala fiddle and it

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,140
could be used as sort of an in-browser

00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:11,390
repple and placed on scholarly org and

00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,010
just like with java jsfiddle people can

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:15,320
use it too and

00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,910
two questions on Stack Overflow for

00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,210
example or we could even figure out a

00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:22,640
way to embed these interactive bits of

00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:26,990
things into these bits of documentation

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,870
into websites as well so right now this

00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:31,850
is just three people and we've kind of

00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,760
stopped development on it mostly because

00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:37,010
we I was getting involved more in the

00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,330
Scala Dex stuff but we're switching back

00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,100
into this student if you're interested

00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,140
in participating we're going to pick up

00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,460
the effort on this in the next month or

00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,570
so

00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:50,960
and finally sort of the next thing that

00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:54,710
we're working on is improving the slip

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,590
process so starting next month we will

00:42:54,710 --> 00:43:00,830
have a sort of new process in place and

00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,690
our goal is to rework this process and

00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,910
rebuild sort of the excitement's and get

00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:06,910
it running again basically so that's

00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:10,040
another thing that we're working on

00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:12,770
that's that's really all I wanted to

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,900
sort of cover about like what what we've

00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,790
been up to what we plan on looking at

00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,840
immediately next what the advisory board

00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,210
is like hey you guys you didn't care

00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,730
about these things what they told us and

00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,000
I also want to just show you who the

00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:28,070
people are who have contributed to us

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,010
somehow so these are the advisory board

00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:33,110
members EPFL is not an advisory board

00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,810
member but a huge contributor and then

00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,430
we have seven companies behind us now

00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:39,560
tap add just joined yesterday actually

00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,420
so tap add is a new new member of the

00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,710
advisory board we have a meeting the

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,650
next value board meeting will be in

00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:47,450
August and if you guys have any sort of

00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:49,310
concerns or anything that you care about

00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:52,100
that the advisory board should discuss

00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,870
we actually have a I mentioned his name

00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,910
before a community member who sits on

00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,500
the advisory board next month we should

00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,970
our next advisory board meeting we

00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,220
should probably have at that point a

00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:04,040
second community member but bill

00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,590
Benner's is is the guy to talk to who is

00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,120
you know sort of the voice the voice of

00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,900
the community on the advisory board so

00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,890
the community outside of that room and

00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:15,980
lots of other people have contributed

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:17,930
including hi CO and Trond and several

00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:20,780
people who have contributed to us in

00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,010
some way and if you ever want to get

00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,570
involved in any of the things that we're

00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,710
doing actually one thing I'd really like

00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,770
you to walk away with is the idea that

00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,360
if you're a scala company is Scala shop

00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:32,190
PRS are a lot more welcome to us than

00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:34,800
money if you want to get involved

00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:37,770
helping us with something like the way

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,750
that 47° contributed this beautiful UI

00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,940
things like this are really amazing

00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:45,570
contributions that benefit really a lot

00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:47,520
of people so beyond that warm and fuzzy

00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,870
feeling that it gives you to give back

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,360
to the community that you're already a

00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:54,690
part of it actually gets your name out

00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,300
basically it it it it's some visibility

00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:59,130
for participating in open-source and

00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,750
some people care about that for

00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,150
recruiting so that's maybe one reason to

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,070
contribute and you know you're also

00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,720
giving back to your own company if

00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,430
you're fixing something that everybody

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,140
is in general using so consider

00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,210
investing somehow in the scale ecosystem

00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:15,120
it doesn't have to be Scala center but

00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:17,460
Scala library Scala compiler one of the

00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,160
cool important projects in our scala tin

00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,050
the scala ecosystem consider considering

00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,030
letting people give back on company time

00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:27,150
that's a really a really great way to

00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,800
participate in the community so so yeah

00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,850
allow your developers to spend some time

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,330
giving back to the Scala in its

00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:35,370
ecosystem and as I mentioned a great

00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,810
example of that is this UI by 47 degrees

00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:39,540
so thank you guys again for contributing

00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:42,240
that and finally if there's anything you

00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:44,370
guys want to tell us please get in

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,080
contact with us we're we're listening we

00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:49,770
maybe don't respond to everything that

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,120
comes up on the gaiter channel or on

00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,770
mailing lists but we're really keeping

00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,840
an eye on what's going on what people

00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,130
what people are saying and of course if

00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,960
you don't want to directly talk to us

00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,000
you can always talk to bill as well he

00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,380
brings lots I mean he's been doing a

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,960
great job of bringing people's concerns

00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,060
to us so there's lots of people to talk

00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,670
to that that are part of this whole

00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:10,440
scala center thing and as well if you're

00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:12,660
interested in participating at all in in

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,340
this Scotland X project yum for example

00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,470
is the guy to talk to so just come talk

00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,210
to us the great place the first the good

00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,320
place to start is this Gator channel we

00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,660
can rat you to the appropriate place

00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,210
after that so that's about all I have to

00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,830
say thank you guys for for sitting

00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,580
through this and I'm happy to take

00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,580
questions if there are any

00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:30,990
