Abstract:
What are microservices all about, and are they practical for your enterprise? How granular should a microservice be, and what approach should you use to determine the proper and appropriate boundaries between microservices? How can each microservice communicate with others in a distributed computing environment to correctly fulfill business objectives? How can my microservices adhere to the tenets of reactive software, being responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven? Using Scala and Akka to implement microservices, this talk will demonstrate how you can implement microservices while answering all of the questions posed, and more. The talk will show you how to carefully craft microservices and to model the business domain within. You will experience advanced use of Akka throughout.
