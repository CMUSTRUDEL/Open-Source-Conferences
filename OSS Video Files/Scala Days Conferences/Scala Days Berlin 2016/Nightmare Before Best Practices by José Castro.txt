Abstract:
A collection of horror stories that derive from a lack of best practices. Everything will be covered: How to make companies lose money, shutdown systems and disable payments (or worse) just from overlooking simple procedures that "take too much time" or "cost too much" to implement. We may even dim the lights at certain points in the presentation.

good morning everyone my name is a

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,070
welcome to night

00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:19,010
for best practices now just before I

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,689
started doing this talk you don't forget

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,480
to rate the confidence the conference

00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:25,550
talks if you enjoy this talk after its

00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,550
ended just go on the app and just rate

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:34,040
I'd enjoyed it if you don't enjoy this

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:36,950
talk don't bother that's ok just to get

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,230

at courtesy I am also a magician and a

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,680
car cheater I can say this in public

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,160
because I don't actually cheat people

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,470
for money i do gambling demonstrations

00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,330
if you if you come and find me in the

00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:52,940
hallway later on you are entitled to a

00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,300
miracle just meet me and say I want my

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,550
miracle and this talk is not about

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,740
courtesy but just so you know where I

00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,390
come from courtesy is an automated code

00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,920
review tool it integrates with get it

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,409
supports a number of languages Scala

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,420
being one of them of course it's free

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:12,320
for open source projects and you should

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,750
totally check it out in fact this is

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,570
where we are right now and there's a

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,490
talk in the afternoon by Eugene is going

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,070
to mention Scala meta and maybe other

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,590
things as well and we actually use

00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,200
kilometer for the scholar static

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,600
analysis that we do so I totally

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,979
encourage you guys to to go and see that

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,370
talk as well but today I am going to

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:40,220
tell you about nightmare scenarios so

00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:42,020
the the inspiration for this talk comes

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,710
from another talk that I saw a couple of

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:47,659
years ago and a friend of mine was doing

00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:51,080
that talk and he said that whenever we

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,700
go to a conference we always share our

00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,590
success stories we're always talking

00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,720
about everything that went right how we

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:59,479
solve problems we're not not we're not

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,030
never talking about how we created the

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,680
problems in the first place and we could

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,799
learn a lot from each other by sharing

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,629
our mistakes so in that with that in

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,189
mind I'm going to share with you five

00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:13,159
nightmare scenarios that actually took

00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:15,260
place because best practices weren't in

00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:16,879
place and then I'm going to talk a

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,450
little bit about some best practices

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,189
that I feel that we all should use I

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:25,180
should add that all of the events in

00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:27,010
this talk took

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,780
exactly as I'm going to describe them

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,400
the only thing I'm omitting is the name

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,750
of the companies and the name of the

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,489
people involved and with that said

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,989
here's nightmare number one the

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,790
developer lost one hundred and eighty

00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:45,159
thousand euros so there's a new website

00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,319
with a shopping cart and there's

00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,319
payments and there's a successful launch

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,239
and everything works and everyone is

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,299
happy until three weeks later three

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,099
weeks later the developer on the project

00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,530
actually makes a purchase on the website

00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,750
himself and he receives the product and

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,579
then he goes to check his credit card

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,900
account and it doesn't find a charge

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:10,329
it's a bit worried so he goes to the

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,769
back office and he realizes that there

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,230
haven't been any charges at all for the

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:16,000
past three weeks but they haven't

00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,790
sounded a lot of stuff they've been

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,060
selling thirty thousand thirty thousand

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,620
euros per week so that's ninety thousand

00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,079
euros that they haven't charged the

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,090
customers so they get in touch with the

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,010
payments platform and they asked this

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,109
they ask them what's going on and they

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,519
say well there are two ways of charging

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:36,690
customers and they could have added

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,690
you're not using any of them

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,040
so way number one is you just charge the

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,830
customer is that simple call to an API

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,870
and you just charge the customer the

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,580
second one is first you request the

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,290
credit approval and then you charge the

00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,180
client you may be familiar with this

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,520
these are two operations whenever you

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,870
book a hotel for instance they're not

00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,490
going to charge you right away but

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,690
they're going to pre-approve the credit

00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,950
to make sure that you have the money to

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:05,110
to pay when you're done but then they

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,850
added by the way after you get the

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,820
approval you have one week to charge the

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:13,210
customer so two weeks of money already

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,750
down the drain and one more week that

00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:19,989
they may lose this is about 4,000 euros

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:22,120
per day every day that passes now is

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,010
going to cost them an additional 4,000

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,220
years this guy doesn't make that much in

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:31,000
a month did I mention that this took

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,800
place in a Friday afternoon I didn't did

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,880
I I didn't because the it actually

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,300
didn't take place in a Friday afternoon

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:43,240
it was friday evening so at 4,000 euros

00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,300
per day we're looking at a potential

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,770
thirteen thousand euros for the weekend

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,510
so if it doesn't solve this problem

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,580
right away but he has a train to catch

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,550
I'm not kidding he the guy had a train

00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,020
to catch and I did mention that the guy

00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,640
lost one hundred and eighty thousand

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:03,190
years and so far he's only lost 90,000

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,460
entered the words you can use this code

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,870
to fix that so somebody handed this guy

00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,700
a script and said we had a similar

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,920
problem in the past and this is how it

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:15,310
solved it you can use this code and

00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,470
it'll solve it and the guy did that and

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,090
if he thought well if I'm going to run

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,980
this over the transactions of this past

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,630
week I can actually run this for the

00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,000
transactions of the three weeks because

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,670
who knows maybe it will work so he goes

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,710
for the weekend the code is running and

00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,330
monday morning is Billy goes to check

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,250
his credit card account and finally

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,350
finally there's something it's the right

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,350
amount and unfortunately it's a refund

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,610
during the weekend this guy issued

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,580
ninety thousand euros in refunds this is

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,940
the best product launch ever you know

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,060
and that's how the guy who lost one

00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:01,220
hundred and eighty thousand euros but

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:03,250
why you know in the API of that payment

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,960
platform there's a bunch of calls and

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,050
unfortunately they all link to the same

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,940
endpoint and that endpoint takes all the

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,940
information that you gave it and there's

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,210
one thing one action ID that tells it

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,520
what you want to do so it took a script

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,890
that no one had touch for a bunch of

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,230
years and the script was doing refunds

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,790
so the guy changed the end point but he

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,660
had no idea that he had to change the

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,150
action ID and that's how he lost one

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,400
hundred and eighty thousand euros or

00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:37,610
almost I mean the guy did lose the money

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,890
but then the technical project manager

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:43,460
got in touch with a payment platform and

00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:45,290
he blamed them for this and those guys

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,290
actually managed to solve the problem

00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:53,330
somehow and they managed to give us the

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:55,150
all the money back what caused this no

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,460
serious testing on the project

00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:01,100
absolutely no call to you no code review

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,430
on the script obviously undocumented

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,150
code on the script releases on Friday

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,300
although in the guy's defense he had to

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:14,300
do something and by the way bonus tip

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,750
last week I found out that it is only ok

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,880
to do a release on thursday as long as

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,410
the following friday is not your

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:28,560
national holiday

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:32,860
and never ever run untested code

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,380
nightmare number two sup of code bits

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,660
was a conference that I helped organize

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,979
for a bunch of years the conference is

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,930
coming back this year with a different

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:43,060
branding if you're interested talk to me

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,280
in the hallway so we're talking about a

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,979
thousand attendees that don't pay a

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,110
thing to be in but they have to apply to

00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,669
get into inside the conference so we get

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,330
to approve people and that's how we

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,840
ensure that we know we don't get

00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:02,500
managers recruiters non-technical people

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,389
we choose the most motivated the people

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,889
with most most potential people who are

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,919
actually going to take something out of

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,530
the conference and the conference last

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,750
for three days 24 hours a day the doors

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,949
don't close there's a bunch of stuff

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,650
going on there's a quiz show

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,020
presentation karaoke Lighting's talks

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,840
etc but I took very core of the event as

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,130
a 48-hour competition so about half the

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,380
attendees gathered together in groups

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:30,039
they build something and at the end they

00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:33,190
have only 90 seconds to present and the

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:35,550
whole attendees the whole attendance get

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,440
to vote on those of those projects and

00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,200
this is a nightmare in three chapters

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,050
chapter number one the visitor the doors

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,790
open people start getting in and after a

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,170
while I go to the back office this is a

00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,029
very simplified version of our back

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,580
office and I do a search and I found

00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:54,310
myself okay I'm approved I have checked

00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,540
in I see our CEO who's been approved and

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,709
he hasn't checked in even though he's

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,700
been in the building for about a week

00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:02,410
now and then I find this guy a guy who

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,190
has not been approved but still managed

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,770
to check in this guy was actually a

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,900
security expert who doesn't have a lot

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,160
of information on him online and he

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,620
didn't want to provide that information

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,050
to the event but it still applied it was

00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,950
the climb because we had no idea who the

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,050
guy was but he decided to show up anyway

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,940
he got to the registration counter he

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,010
provided his name someone did a quick

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,170
search his name showed up there's a tiny

00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,870
badge on the bottom right corner that

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,030
said rejected the person didn't even

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,760
realize that the person clicked the

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,590
checking button and everything

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,220
so the guy gets in and for the next

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:44,950
three days is totally silent on linkedin

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,900
twitter facebook everything there's no

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,000
movement we can't find him we don't have

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,040
a picture of the guy we have no idea

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,860
where he is we only know that he managed

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,510
to check in this is a potential problem

00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,340
for us because pretty much everyone

00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,370
inside the building as a friend was not

00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:02,770
accepted so the moment those people find

00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:04,300
out they're going to be angry and also

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,490
if he starts telling all these friends

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:10,090
that this works we might have a

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:13,780
situation in our hands chapter number

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,270
two the anonymous tip this is a profile

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,360
on the code bits website this is the

00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,700
back office for editing that profile you

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,980
can change pretty much anything and a

00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,840
few days before the event a guy sent us

00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,900
an email saying i am really pissed i

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,890
have to share something with you because

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,080
some of my friends were not approved

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,670
that's okay but i know these two guys

00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,770
one of them was approved the other one

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,600
wasn't the guy was approved is not going

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,980
to be able to make it to the event so

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,170
they're going to change the name and the

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,820
picture of his profile really clever we

00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:49,780
ended up sending an email to those two

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,850
guys none of them showed up but still

00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:55,020
it's a security vulnerability we have no

00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:58,360
idea whether someone did is before

00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:01,120
chapter number three voting so at the

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,590
very end of the the conference you get

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
people on stage presenting a project

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:07,630
this year shows you that there's four

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,240
seconds left to vote this group so far

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:13,620
has gathered 80 votes in favor 49 votes

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,340
against and this is part of the audience

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,650
now at 90 projects 90 seconds that's

00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,140
over two hours of project presentations

00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,000
and we want everyone to vote for all of

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,730
them but that's a really really long

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,610
time if we factor in 10 seconds just 10

00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,360
seconds to vote that's 15 minutes more

00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:36,340
and guess what the guy who built this

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,080
part ii only tested with one person

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:44,550
voting at a time yeah so on the very

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,550
first project the site went down

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:53,820
so there's people hacking live solving

00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,950
the problem while the all the attendance

00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,240
is waiting and they managed to fix it

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:03,270
but at the end we got a few problems an

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,780
unauthorized entry at least one some

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,070
security flaws and a website down and

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:12,420
it's interesting because the causes for

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,680
this are no tests no swelling

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,380
specification didn't account for

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,090
security issues and no stress testing

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,950
when what's funny is that we have a

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,350
quality assurance team we had a security

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:27,390
team and we had a team specialized on

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:30,000
doing stress testing but but the thing

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,560
is this wasn't a real project so this is

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,560
just an event that we were putting

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,960
together so we try to keep it on as

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,430
lower budget as we could and that's what

00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,510
we got in return nightmare number three

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,760
switching services and this is actually

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:48,050
a nightmare that took place before code

00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,220
start being written a travel website

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,290
it's based on a specific content

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:54,900
provided there's countries their cities

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:57,110
so basically travel destinations and

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,670
there's photos of those destinations and

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,640
we did the technical specification for

00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,470
the project we prepare the roadmap we

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,720
prepared everything we have the deadline

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,700
we announce the project and then

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,670
somebody said let's use a different

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,500
service for the photos I don't really

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,270
like the photos from the sir from our

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,770
partners so we're going to use this

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,840
other ones because i like those photos

00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:23,460
best the problem is our partner add

00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,800
location IDs for the travel destinations

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:30,210
and the new service a gps coordinates

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,990
and a location radius and everybody said

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:35,370
yes because no one had realized this now

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,950
we need to convert from one thing to the

00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,170
other there's two schools of thoughts

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,090
one is based on centroids and one of

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,790
those is one the other one is based on

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,190
the central point of interest if we take

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,950
a look at centroids and taking a look at

00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,880
Portugal for instance where I come from

00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,070
that over there is the center of

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,360
Portugal and here we have the capital

00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,350
Lisbon so if you are if you want to show

00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,590
relevant pictures of the country you

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,830
have

00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:05,720
use a location radius but before you get

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:08,970
to the to the capital you get to Spain

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,130
if you use a small location radius the

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,170
photos you showing might not be that

00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,830
relevant in the case of Portugal at the

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:18,240
very center of our country have this

00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,310
this is actually a monument that marks

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,740
the center of the country and many many

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,360
countries have something like this so

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,310
what if we use the other school of

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,040
thought the other school of thought goes

00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,590
to the capital if you look like the GPS

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,430
coordinates of Portugal it gives you GPS

00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:37,170
coordinates inside the Capitol Lisbon

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,320
now if i'm going to show you pictures of

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:43,200
portugal and if i'm trying to get you to

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,100
do some vacation sightseeing in portugal

00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:50,640
this is what I'm trying to show you I am

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:55,380
NOT trying to show you this street that

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:57,840
I have never been to and back then I

00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,940
decided to go go on google street view

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,090
to see what this kind of coordinates

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:08,520
would give me in the case of lisbon this

00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:12,140
is what you get which is not bad if you

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,140
look at the other side of the street i

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,260
did some search I I real I found out

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,940
that in at the very center of spain for

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,610
instance they sell electronic equipment

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,730
i found out that the very centre of

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:30,720
finland and brazil look very much the

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:33,120
same but but what I really wasn't

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,640
expecting was to find that the very core

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,640
of Japan a freaking elevator

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:46,400
japan you know but on closer inspection

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,680
that really isn't an elevator because

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,110
there's a door handle here that says

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,580
Steph only that's an emergency exit so

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,070
at the very center of the country they

00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,070
have an emergency exit for staff only

00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:04,670
the problems here were wrong time

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,410
estimation additional technical issues

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,110
to solve even before we started coding

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,690
and attacked him unable to meet the

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,480
deadline and guess what the project

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:17,110
never launched the because this wasn't

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,120
the only change that was requested and

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,620
the project was aborted and then later

00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,690
on another team picked it up with a

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:27,500
different specification and then they

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:30,590
finally managed to do it what caused

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:34,610
this well changes in specification and I

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:36,140
know I know ajl agile a gel but just

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,080
because you're a gel doesn't mean that

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,910
another team gets to gather in another

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,840
room and decide what you're going to do

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:47,420
with the same guideline nightmare number

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,210
four also in two chapters and the first

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,010
chapter is called the laptop another

00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,050
payment platform and everything was

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,710
working for a while and then the

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,240
developer goes on vacation and then this

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:06,920
happened somebody closes that guy's

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:08,270
laptop and unfortunately the guy didn't

00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,480
believe in cell phone so he couldn't

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,520
reach him and guess what on that guy's

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,760
laptop there was an SSH tunnel

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,490
connecting to production servers

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:26,970
so when they close the laptop no more

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:28,880
payments fast forward a few years this

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,430
time we have a newsletter platform and

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,920
there's a new product a new client that

00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,470
as a new newsletter that we have to put

00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,660
inside our platform and that's okay

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,410
we're we're ready for that although we

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,420
weren't ready for 250,000 subscribers

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,610
that have to receive the newsletter in

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,560
less than an hour and in fact that was

00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,690
the compromise after a few meetings what

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,330
they wanted was that all of them would

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,210
receive the newsletter exactly precisely

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,890
at one o'clock and we asked him why and

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,750
they said because the product is called

00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:06,480
at one o'clock so they wanted people to

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,230
read their newsletter while they were

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,890
having lunch and our platform wasn't

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,560
able to do that so enter the words

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:18,900
temporary solution let's build something

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,160
a different newsletter platform just for

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:25,740
this case until we fix our big big

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,720
platform so the newsletter goes life and

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,670
everything words because the two guys

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,430
doing that they were really good and

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,590
they managed to do a newsletter system

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:37,500
and email delivery system that was

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:40,590
really really fast and then somebody

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:43,230
goes on vacation again and then there's

00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:47,310
no newsletter we check the guy didn't

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,750
have a laptop we went into the

00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,020
production machine because there was no

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:54,450
documentation and we went to look for

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,180
the the processes that were running and

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:00,570
instead we found a screen session which

00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,950
is never a good sign we had no idea of

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,140
knowing what was inside the screen

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,350
session but weekly check is bash history

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:10,920
so we could see what kind of comments

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:14,580
the guy was running and that that took

00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,250
us to a database in on that database

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,800
this is what we found we found a couple

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,530
I knew that the newsletter at three

00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,680
different segments so we found for each

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:28,440
day three records for the three

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,820
different segments but on that day there

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,510
was something else something called

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,240
segment

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:36,540
and there's a status column with a D and

00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:39,990
I figure d it might be delivered so I

00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:42,840
figured let's delete this row the the

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,910
extra 10 now and hold on it worked the

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,610
news letter was sent suddenly everything

00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:51,000
was working why did this happen well

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:54,270
obviously the system stopped because it

00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,140
couldn't handle that line but the reason

00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:00,180
that this worked that this happened was

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,980
that with the words temporary solution

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,210
instead of having a combo box or

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,430
something like that to select the

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:10,170
segment that you delivering to there was

00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:12,870
a text field a text area and the reason

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,940
that the platform had been working until

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,040
the guy went on vacation was the same

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,660
reason that the guy had stopped having

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:23,010
lunch with us so every every day around

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,620
half past noon the guy was sitting at

00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:29,840
his laptop waiting for the client to

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,840
make a typo and then he would fix it

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:38,820
temporary solution you know so in one

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,670
case payments stopped and in the other a

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,230
newsletter wasn't sent why because of

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:47,700
the absence of deployment methodologies

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:51,030
and also lack of documentation now I

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,400
would imagine I see people nodding all

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,590
the way I would imagine that most of

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,430
these best practices even if you don't

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,080
follow them you're aware of them right

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:06,150
he's a nightmare that took place before

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:10,610
get an svn were around so the code was

00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:13,350
on CBS but not all of it all of it and

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,660
the rest of the code was on a file

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,420
system the production file system which

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:22,290
was which was also a shared file system

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:24,840
and there were snapshot snapshots of the

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,210
system daily snapshots so everything was

00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,000
working this was a big project we had

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,470
moved a sizable team from Portugal to

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,620
Brazil to do this for over half a year

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,810
but on the same file system there was a

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,330
webmail platform and that platform was

00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,250
getting slower and slower and the guys

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,380
who were handling

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,750
we're looking for a way to make it

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,730
faster and then one of the guys says

00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,570
I'll look snapshots we don't need these

00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:57,680
we can tell them off and they do and we

00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:02,120
don't realize that and a few days later

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:04,260
somebody is upgrading the server and

00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,850
when the leading a fault that they make

00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:15,080
a typo and they did this as root so

00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:17,760
suddenly our code was gone now at 6am

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,150
everybody got a wake-up call an early

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,550
wake-up call calling everyone in for an

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:25,560
emergency meeting at that emergency

00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,900
meeting everyone was making excuses that

00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,510
everyone is explaining how this was not

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,750
their fault everyone except one guy that

00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,180
one guy was the one guy who got late to

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,180
the meeting with a huge smile on his

00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:41,580
face and when they asked them why are

00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,280
you smiling about he said I just fixed

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:48,210
the problem you see the code was deleted

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:51,420
but the code was still live on memory

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,790
and these were templates so the guy did

00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,800
a ton of the whole the whole memory he

00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,930
gathered the team in a room he coached

00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,330
him for a while and he taught them to

00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:03,390
fetch the the templates from the memory

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:09,000
and after a while he had the code back

00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:11,130
with snapshots why did this happen The

00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,630
Lost code the causes are slightly

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,180
different from the previous nightmare

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,730
scenarios untested data recovery

00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:21,180
procedures you turn on the snapshots and

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,600
you forget about that permanently we saw

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,160
sharing between projects and also

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,190
abusing credentials when you're dealing

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,470
with production machines I should add

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:38,390
that this guy is currently working on

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:41,970
google's site reliability team now these

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,420
scenarios they everything he rapin for a

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:47,550
reason a list of best practices that

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,400
that would have to be a really big book

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:53,460
but if i could only mention a few these

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,290
would be technical specification so

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,280
before you start you should know what

00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:59,100
you're doing

00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,780
or what you're aiming for some kind of

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,910
coding standards to ensure that your

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,910
code is breathable maintainable less

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:08,190
prone to errors code review obviously

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:09,900
and i'm referring to both peer review

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,670
and automated call review and i know

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,770
that i might seem bias because i

00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,690
actually work at a an automated code

00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,980
review platform but it's not like I'm

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:22,980
trying to pass any kind of some

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:28,680
subliminal message here but but just in

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:31,980
case you missed it that's and also

00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:34,080
testing all kinds of testing some kind

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:36,720
of deployment methodology that really

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,500
works and also technical documentation

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,930
not just writing it but also having the

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,080
habit of looking for it when you get

00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:47,190
into a project now there's two more

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,360
things that I want to tell you about

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,950
regarding best practices the first one

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,800
is that best practices are different

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,750
from language to language if we look at

00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,450
static analysis tools from different

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,880
languages we will see that patterns are

00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,610
different sometimes there's a reason

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,620
sometimes there really isn't something

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,120
like a to do comment you've probably

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,880
seen to the comments or fixed me

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,080
comments right the patterns to look for

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,110
this are different from language to

00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,050
language if you look at Java it's pretty

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:21,150
simple it looks for fix me and to do and

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,070
it raises a warning says you shouldn't

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,110
have this if there's a fix me then

00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,780
you're probably our code isn't ready if

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:31,050
you look at scala it's similar but now

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,030
it gets case sensitive options if you

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:36,900
look at javascript you get to to fix me

00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:39,180
XXX case insensitive you get an option

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,430
to search for these elsewhere in the

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,860
comment not just in the beginning but if

00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,600
you look at Ruby you get something

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,910
different so instead of raising a

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,260
warning there's only a convention to

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,860
make sure that you're writing those

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,020
comments properly if you get a broader

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,880
look and if you look at comments you'll

00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,490
see that these are very very different

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,110
from language to language in Ruby

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,000
there's a pattern that I haven't found

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,240
in any other language to ensure that

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,210
your comments are written in ascii so no

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,470
hiragana katakana kanji nothing like

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,260
and it makes sense because the language

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:16,350
comes from Japan and in other languages

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,470
this probably wasn't an issue you'll

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:22,289
find a pattern to prevent block comments

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:25,789
and also a pattern to prohibit inline

00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:29,880
comments I guess you have to choose and

00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:33,750
also a pattern to enforce a living space

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,549
on a on a comment and I'll show in a bit

00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:38,250
why this is important if you look at

00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,679
javascript it's different it's going to

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,059
enforce empty lines around comments you

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,460
get to prohibit the inline comments

00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:47,130
again the warning comes it to do's and

00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,429
fix means and now you get another

00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,799
pattern for spaces in the beginning of

00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:55,909
comments but you get to choose whether

00:26:52,799 --> 00:27:00,980
you're enforcing them or preventing them

00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:03,600
so clearly best practices are subjective

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,820
if you look at Java there's a bunch of

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,279
stuff it's it's really different from

00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,260
the other languages some of them are

00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:12,600
specific to the language and there's

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,909
even a pattern to prevent politically

00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,799
incorrect comments this actually

00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:19,890
prevents you from liking something like

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,830
whoever did this was an idiot which

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:27,750
tells you a lot about a language I'm

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:29,610
kidding how many of you are familiar

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,380
with best practices for regular

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,730
expressions it's not something very

00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,740
common one person if you look at Ruby

00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,720
there's only two patterns that I could

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,340
find one of them is to prevent some

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,380
ambiguity when you're reading the code

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,480
and the other one is to prevent denial

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,070
of service attacks so to prevent that

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,169
you're using part of the user's input

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:53,100
and placing that in a regular expression

00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:55,140
that you use in somewhere else this this

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,179
isn't present in many other languages

00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:02,130
and the reason for that is probably that

00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:05,580
these guys probably due to a really cool

00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,340
framework that they have they they found

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,929
this problem quite often if you go to

00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,210
JavaScript it's completely different

00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:13,940
you're going to get these kind of

00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,500
patterns for instance prohibiting

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,970
invalid regular expressions or more fun

00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,710
regular expressions there's a reason for

00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:21,389
that the reason is that the code is not

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,350
running on your servers it's running on

00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:25,500
the browser on the

00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,600
inside so if it's broken you're not even

00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,130
going to see that so if you're not

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,530
compiling your code before your shipping

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,090
it to the client at least the static

00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,250
analysis tool is going to look at it and

00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,620
it's going to tell you a this should be

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:42,480
fixed and then there's a few other

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:44,220
things if you look at Java it's

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,559
completely different for instance a file

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,169
separator it's it's a variable that is

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,059
different on linux systems and the

00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:52,740
windows system so it's going to warn you

00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:55,980
your regular expression is going to

00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,919
defer from system to system if you look

00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,190
at Python oddly this is the complete

00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,650
list there's no particular reason for

00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:06,630
that I know because I spoke with a the

00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,850
main maintainer of pie length there's no

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,760
particular reason it's just that no one

00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:13,919
has found the necessity of building

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,830
those patterns for regular expressions

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:23,299
in Python which brings us this to pearl

00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:27,950
I apologize in advance for the font size

00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:30,480
ok this is more readable the thing is

00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,400
many of these most of these almost all

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,039
of them they make sense in other

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,850
languages as well but these guys have

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,620
found this more often some of them have

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,890
to do with the readability of the code

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,230
some of them have to do with performance

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,250
some have to do with possible typos some

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,289
of them like this one for instance

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,390
prohibiting unusual delimiters this is

00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:54,090
specific to pearl because instead of

00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,320
having / is the limiting your regular

00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,640
expression you can have pretty much

00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,890
anything else you can have the pound

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,260
sign if you want to and that is useful

00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,179
in some cases like if your expression

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,990
has a lot of slashes this way you don't

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:10,890
have to back / everything but in terms

00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,600
of readability it's not that good so the

00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,549
first thing I want you to take from from

00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,650
this talk is that best practices do

00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:18,590
change across different languages that's

00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,909
not a bad thing you can learn a lot by

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:24,330
looking at what other languages are

00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:25,860
doing but even in the same language if

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,590
you take a look at scala if you take a

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:32,659
look at the few style guides the data

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:35,730
breaks is callous style guard which is

00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:36,300
interesting because these guys with over

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,640
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,140
contributors they really have to make

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,820
sure that everyone is writing the same

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,830
kind of code the Scala style guide

00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:50,730
effective scholar from twitter and also

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,190
paypal's scholar style Gareth and by the

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,020
way just a side note if you happen to

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:57,330
use coda see you can actually select

00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:00,330
those style guides they are not

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:01,860
comprehensive but most of the rules if

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,330
we have them they're going to be

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,630
displayed for you and you can enable

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,740
those standards but all of these

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,730
standards I can tell you right now

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:14,760
they're all good but they are different

00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:17,640
something is simple as a line land data

00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,860
bricks imposes a maximum of a hundred

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,960
characters if you go to scholar style

00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,880
guide you're down to 80 characters if

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,250
you go to effective skull you're back at

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,990
100 but if you go to paypal it's like

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:32,310
they're saying we have more money for

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,620
bigger screenings it's different you

00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:37,500
know it's it depends on what your

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,510
environment is some of these style guys

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,970
have special rules on the data breaks

00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,770
style guide there's the special rule of

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,990
30 that a method should contain less

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,130
than 30 lines of code in general and a

00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,650
class should contain less than 30

00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:52,200
methods it makes sense it's not present

00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:55,140
in the other style guides some of the

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,780
guides mentioned for instance that local

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,150
names should be short or can be short

00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:02,070
not all of them mentioned this if you

00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,690
look at spacing and indentation they're

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,360
all going to agree on a to space

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,650
indentation and if you want to use like

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,330
something like a force base indentation

00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,900
that's okay as long as you're consistent

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:14,940
throughout your coat but if you go and

00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,490
look at each of those guys they're going

00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,080
to have further information they're

00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,510
going to some of them are going to

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,520
explain what you should do for

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,220
parameters that don't fit a single line

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,920
stuff like that this was the only

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,140
occasion so far in every single language

00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,630
that I found someone saying that you

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,540
shouldn't use vertical alignment before

00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,600
i read this style guide i believed that

00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:43,170
vertical alignment was a good thing and

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:47,340
i still do but they make a very good

00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:50,070
point of why it might be bad for you and

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,899
it might make sense in a lot of cases

00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:55,509
if you go to effective scally you get

00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:58,990
stuff like blank lines if you go to the

00:32:55,509 --> 00:33:02,169
paypal skala style add a new line to the

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,519
end of the file which is it makes

00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:06,159
sense it's not present in the other

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,679
style guides so my point here is that

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,360
there are different style guides none of

00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,690
them is right or wrong they they will

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:16,360
all probably approach right but you

00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,360
should look at everything and make you

00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,190
jump to your own conclusions and

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,769
speaking of conclusions what I really

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,269
want you to take from this is that best

00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:28,000
practices do differ from language to

00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:31,210
language you can learn a lot from the

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,980
other languages and they even defy

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:36,279
within the same language sometimes

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,230
within the same company and you can

00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,600
learn a lot by looking at what others

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,730
are doing you know we learn a lot from

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,950
mistakes but no one says that you don't

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:47,409
learn a lot from mistakes that other

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,500
people did and you can also learn a lot

00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:52,269
from what other people are doing right

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:55,330
I'm adding here just a few links so that

00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:59,500
later on on the slides you can jump to

00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:03,360
some other stuff and do remember to rate

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,360
this session thank you very much

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:17,510
we do have a this we do have a few

00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:21,290
minutes if anyone has a one or two

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,270
questions if not I can tell you that one

00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,850
of the best questions I got asked so far

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,419
was what happened to the developer lost

00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:32,390
a hundred and eighty thousand years and

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:36,230
I can tell you that it didn't get a

00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:38,570
raise him he was kept on the team

00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,190
obviously and our CEO after 20 years

00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,320
with the company he finally moved they

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:44,870
started his own company and out of a

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,600
technical team of over 200 people it

00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,929
shows just 15 developers to take with

00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,070
him and that was one of the guys

00:34:49,929 --> 00:35:00,380
sometimes it's not about the mess you

00:34:52,070 --> 00:35:03,290
make is how you deal with it so if there

00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,480
are no questions at the moment I will be

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,960
outside I will have a deck of playing

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,080
cards with me and I'll meet you around

00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,080
