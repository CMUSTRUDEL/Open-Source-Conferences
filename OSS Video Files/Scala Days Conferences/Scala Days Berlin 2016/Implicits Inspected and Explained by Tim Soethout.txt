Anstract:
At the keynote at Scala Exchange, Jessica Kerr mentioned that there is very much documentation for starting and expert Scala developers but (almost) nothing in between. In this talk I want to demystify implicits. Implicits are a fairly advanced feature and a very important aspect of the Scala language. They help with writing concise code and enable lots of DSLs. On the other side, they can be very magical for an untrained eye. In this talk, we will delve into idiomatic use cases of implicits and how the Scala compiler resolves them. If time allows, we will jump into type classes as well.
