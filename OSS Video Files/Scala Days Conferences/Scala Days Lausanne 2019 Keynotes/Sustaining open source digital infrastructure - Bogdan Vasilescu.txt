	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,310
morning I'm super excited to be here

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,350
thank you very much for coming thank you

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,240
for waking up early and getting over

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,769
your hangovers perhaps I really

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,170
appreciate it I'm super excited to be

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,240
here I actually missed two planes or one

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,220
was canceled and one was delayed and I

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,750
almost didn't make it so I'm extra

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,500
excited because of this thank you for

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,430
coming

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,650
before I begin two things first some

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,269
acknowledgments all the work that I will

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,580
be presenting here has obviously not

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,320
been done just by me has been done by my

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,669
students primarily who are the smart

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,399
people that are actually doing all this

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,809
cool stuff and by my collaborators who

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,980
have influenced the way I think and so

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,540
on and have helped me with all of this

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,210
so this talk would not have been

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,870
possible without them a big thank you to

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,620
them

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,399
second Heather was right and thank you

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,320
for an introduction

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,180
I do come here as an outsider I spend my

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,190
time at Carnegie Mellon University in

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,890
Pittsburgh this is what our campus looks

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,930
like I spend my time teaching and

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,670
mentoring and doing research with

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,700
graduate students when I'm not chasing

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,240
funding like everyone else but that

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,479
means that oh if you are noticing here

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,850
we have not one but two ivory towers for

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,479
all the academics at CMU to spend their

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,600
time in this means that I'm a little bit

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,570
an outsider both to the scala community

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,009
as well as to the work that many of you

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,920
are actually doing on the grounds

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,920
building cool things but at the same

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,259
time I did spend quite a bit of time

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,720
studying how people build open source

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,119
software and how these communities work

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,590
and function so I would really like to

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,070
share some of these insights with you

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,110
today

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,970
hopefully you'll serve as an interesting

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,759
point of comparison to the scholar

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,890
community but really I'm here to learn

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,020
from all of you about how the scala

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,759
community operates and works what are

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,490
the challenges that the scala community

00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:02,219
faces okay before we really dive in can

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,860
I ask you to also introduce yourselves a

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:10,590
little bit so I'm gonna do this with a

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:13,500
quiz and let's see how well the internet

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:17,310
works here so if you would endure

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,260
me and take your mobile phones out I'm

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,990
assuming you're connected to Wi-Fi

00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,410
somehow could you tell me a little bit

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:28,410
about of what your engagement with open

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,430
source is just just for me to get a

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,430
better flavor for who the audience is so

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:40,080
yeah go to this website Manta calm and

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,870
type in the code you see there Wow cool

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:50,400
I actually never done this before I'm

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:54,510
quite impressed cool

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,720
whoever built this deserves credit cool

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,720
app

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:16,709
yeah I love it right so this is it this

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,120
means I'm in the right crowd here it's

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,450
exactly what I was hoping for I was

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,670
hoping for a mix of people that are busy

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,680
building open-source software and people

00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,049
that are busy using open source software

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,950
because that we're seeing interesting

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:34,650
dynamics from from both stakeholders

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,230
okay this is this is great so please

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,060
hold on to your phones and through this

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,980
webpage because we'll be using it a

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:47,010
couple more times throughout the talk if

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:51,299
you don't mind okay so I want to talk to

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,599
you today about open source software and

00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,760
how I see it changing in the last few

00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,530
years obviously I don't need to tell you

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,260
about how important open source software

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,299
is some of you may have read this great

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,090
report that Nadia Iqbal wrote a couple

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,370
years ago talking about how open source

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,590
software is the digital infrastructure

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,810
that our world relies on in much the

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,669
same way that roads and bridges are the

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,579
physical infrastructure that our economy

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,500
is based on and how pretty much anyone

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,570
and everyone uses open source software

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,110
and to some extent I'm sure you know

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:27,840
this I'm sure you also know that open

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:30,660
source software needs this steady supply

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,320
of efforts for it to be sustainable it

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,330
needs people doing things and continuing

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,340
to do things over time because all kinds

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,820
of bad things can happen otherwise you

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:44,580
might remember the left pad incident

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,310
does anybody know about this MP idea

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,740
many of you know about this 11 lines of

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,349
code that took the half the internet

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,990
down for a few hours you might remember

00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:57,960
the heartbleed incident that happened in

00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,120
open SSL some years ago at the time open

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,940
SSL was maintained by a single full-time

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,580
person and it's such a critical piece of

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:10,440
infrastructure for all of our economy

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:13,860
pretty much ok so um I'm gonna argue the

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,169
premise for this talk is that creating

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,229
sustainable open-source communities is

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,889
hard has always been hard but I'm gonna

00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:23,040
argue

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:26,850
it's maybe even harder today than it

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,860
used to be before because of the ways in

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,759
which open source software changed in

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,759
the last few years

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:39,660
much like the academic stereotype I will

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,300
over promise and under deliver so I'm

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,430
gonna raise more problems than I will

00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,070
provide solutions for so just just a

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,139
heads up but to compensate a little bit

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,830
for the inevitable disappointments that

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:55,560
you might have here's a photo of Nanook

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,490
exclusive photo of marouk that I took

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,979
myself in Pittsburgh when he was younger

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,860
notice how long the tongue is I don't

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,229
know how this is physically possible

00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,180
okay so how has open source software

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,940
changed let me tell you some of the ways

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,070
that I see it as having changed one is

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,229
obviously github deserves a lot of

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,050
credit for standardizing the practice

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,750
and for changing or standardizing the

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,310
way people work through their UI and the

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,050
Porticus model they've made it easier

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,580
for people to contribute and so on now

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,610
we all speak the same language this

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,630
github workflow language and this has

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,699
resulted in a lot more production these

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,699
tests are probably old by now there's

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,380
literally over a hundred million open

00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,460
source repositories on github there's

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,900
millions more on the other competitors

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,849
some of you might remember this big move

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,280
when Microsoft announced they're buying

00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:52,590
github people were migrating and mass to

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,310
give lab so a lab is now also a big

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,229
competitor in the space okay so a lot

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:03,270
more open source now than we used to

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:05,610
have a big change is also really this

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,449
high level of transparency and this is

00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,070
maybe not obvious at first glance but

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,900
it's really I argue one of the

00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,460
fundamental ways in which open source

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,550
has changed together with the emergence

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:21,080
of github the fact that now open-source

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,630
programmers have these social media like

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,400
personas and profile pages online that

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,130
aggregate all kinds of information about

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,529
them and similarly open source projects

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,780
have these profile pages that aggregate

00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,270
all kinds of information

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:38,000
them and there's been a lot of research

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,040
showing how this high level of

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,350
transparency into what people are doing

00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,330
and how projects are being developed and

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,970
maintained and so on how this high level

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,710
of transparency has been changing pretty

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,240
much everything has been changing the

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,240
way people collaborate the way they

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,030
write code has been changing recruiting

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,910
and hiring these profilers have come to

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:04,610
act or to replace traditional resumes

00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:08,060
for for many of us another change is the

00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:10,700
fact that I think the fact that these

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,910
projects are not really developed in

00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,060
isolation but really this is a very

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,050
complex organic ecosystem of

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,720
interdependencies interconnections

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,790
between projects between people there's

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,460
technical dependencies and so on between

00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,630
libraries there's social dependencies

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,130
that people that are maintaining

00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,680
multiple projects are contributing to

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,780
multiple projects at the same time all

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,320
kinds of relationships being formed

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:39,500
between these stakeholders this is a

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,839
very organic very complex socio

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,940
technical ecosystem it's not just codes

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,120
that's lives there somewhere but is this

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,040
this big socio technical thing and

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,150
you've seen that this can be quite

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,370
brittle right the left bad example

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,410
coming back from a minute ago you could

00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,980
see how very easily

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,770
small changes somewhere in the ecosystem

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,850
can perturb pretty much everything else

00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,850
and have a huge impact

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,760
another thing that changed is this

00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:21,560
increasing level of commercialization

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:24,920
and professionalization it used to be

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,350
the case that open-source software was

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,380
built was maintained by these

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,290
communities of volunteers and that's

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,480
pretty much gone these days as far as I

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,010
can tell there's a lot a lot of

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,050
commercial involvement in open-source

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,720
there's open source projects that are

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,400
started by companies and made

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,930
open-source there's all kinds of

00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,440
startups that are operating in this

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,970
space

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,010
on a snapshot from the big survey that

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,410
github ran a couple of years ago some of

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,270
you might remember this shows that a lot

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,330
of people that are contributing to open

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:01,850
source are doing it doing it as part of

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:04,250
their jobs and the small poll we ran in

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:09,980
a couple minutes ago showed the same

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:13,780
thing again so interestingly does

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,120
anybody know about the Equifax scandal

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,600
fewer of you then left but okay good so

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Equifax is a company in the United

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:28,160
States that calculates the credit score

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:32,870
of Americans which affects their ability

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,440
to get credit from banks and so on

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:39,290
Equifax was hacked a year or two ago I

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,320
don't remember exactly and as part of

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,630
that the personal information of about a

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,400
hundred and fifty million Americans so

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,890
it's half the population of the United

00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,380
States the personal information of about

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:58,730
one hundred and fifty million people was

00:10:51,380 --> 00:11:01,280
stolen and interestingly Equifax blamed

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,430
all of this on an open source project on

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,120
Apache struts which is where the

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:10,790
vulnerability happened even though they

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,650
never contributed themselves to open

00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,140
source they never supported open source

00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:19,550
development and they actually never

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:22,520
reacted to all the warnings and requests

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:26,600
to update their out-of-date versions of

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:28,970
struts to remove this vulnerability so a

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:33,260
lot of expectation a lot of pressure

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,900
from users of open source that the

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,000
infrastructure be of high quality be

00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,130
very reliable be very secure and so on

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,560
and so forth this is just one of many

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,910
examples of this increasing pressure

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,950
that's being put on open-source

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:53,800
maintainer you also see this in the

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:57,500
smaller day-to-day interactions between

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,610
users and maintainer x' because again

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,640
with github is

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,560
so much easier now to to contribute to

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,579
report issues to submit pull requests

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,980
anyone can do it

00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,709
there's obviously growing volumes of

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:18,290
these things there's a lot more of these

00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:19,029
this is a snapshot I took yesterday oops

00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,370
there we go

00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:25,610
snapshot I took yesterday off the

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:29,029
scholar github page showing close to

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,649
2,000 issues being opened I guess pretty

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,450
much at any point in time there's

00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,779
thousands of these issues being opened

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,459
now I don't know if there's any plan of

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:38,990
ever closing them or if there's just a

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:41,480
backlog I don't know exactly what the

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,430
situation is but lots of these requests

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,029
that somebody has to look at and decide

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:50,240
something about and do something with

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:52,190
there's also social pressure to respond

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,230
to your contributors as a maintainer

00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,700
because if you don't you risk losing

00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,430
them there is going away and never

00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,690
coming back and research has shown this

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:04,579
and all kinds of very interesting

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,130
arguably toxic interactions that are

00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:11,269
visible in these open-source communities

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,279
I am tasting here two quotes we have

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:16,820
been collecting these there's many

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:20,269
examples like these off very rude very

00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,089
entitled types of requests that users

00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:28,279
are making on the open source or to the

00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:31,010
open-source maintainer okay so this

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:35,269
brings me to my next quiz I'd like to

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:41,570
get a feel for how prevalent these

00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:44,149
things are in the scholar community can

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,279
you tell me if you ever feel as

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:49,339
maintainer Zoar contributors to open

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:50,990
source those among you that are doing

00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,870
this could you tell me if you ever feel

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,940
overwhelmed by the amount of feature

00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:01,279
requests or issues or bug reports and so

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:05,440
on that people are that users are

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,440
producing on your projects

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:22,319
interesting Wow so this is worse than I

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,380
thought

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:30,930
about half of you are saying that that

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,209
this is an issue that there's a lot of

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:37,160
demand and arguably a lot of stress

00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:47,550
being caused by these high volumes of of

00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:50,519
requests thank you thank you so much so

00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:53,970
similarly do you feel that this is

00:14:50,519 --> 00:15:02,009
sustainable are these interactions

00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:03,930
healthy do you think sorry I'll come

00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:07,199
back to the innominate do you feel that

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,430
these are healthy interactions that is

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,380
sustainable is this you see this

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,569
continuing without people burning out

00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,050
without you burning out without users

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,050
going away

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:42,160
right so this mirrors to a large extent

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,839
what we saw earlier there's still

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,740
there's still a lot we could we could do

00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:51,050
to improve it seems related to this how

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,570
do you prioritize these things when you

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,570
get all these requests from from your

00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,980
users how do you prioritize these right

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:03,250
I'm you know assuming that almost 2,000

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,560
open issues in in Scala right now

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,660
somebody has to prioritize even even

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,520
looking at these let alone closing them

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,779
and dealing with them like how do you do

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,279
this I would love to hear how people how

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,870
people actually do this and if there are

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,490
any best practices that we could learn

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,500
from as a community that others can

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:32,209
learn from from you in terms of how to

00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:35,510
how to deal with this random high-risk

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:38,149
first up Vosges that's a nice that's a

00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:40,070
nice way so elbows I guess means whether

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:41,630
you perceive that this issue affects

00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,010
lots of people there are lots of people

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,000
care about fixing this that gets higher

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:54,920
priority interesting what does go to

00:16:47,000 --> 00:17:01,220
sleep mean whoever answered that maybe

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:05,179
would help clarify how do you know

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:09,770
what's critical though that obvious from

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:12,640
just the surface level reports can you

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,640
can you always tell

00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,370
okay thank you I'll come back to this

00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:29,200
later and and share a summary of all of

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:32,060
these things with you after after talk

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,530
one more thing that I see changing I

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,540
don't know to which extent is changing

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,300
but I'm gonna argue in a second that it

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,540
has but as opposed to it being always

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,160
the status quo really low demographic

00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,560
diversity in these open source

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,110
communities on the one hand you have

00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,690
this low barrier to entry at least in

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,340
theory on paper anyone can contribute to

00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,100
any open source project it's all out

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:59,080
there on the web somewhere on github

00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:01,610
usually on the other hand very very low

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,230
demographic diversity here in particular

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm talking about women as one of the

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:09,050
underrepresented minorities there's

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,580
around 5% women in these open-source

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,840
communities either github or stack

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,990
overflow

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,900
which is really surprising because

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:21,410
industry reports about 20% or so women

00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,770
in technical jobs in in software

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,990
engineering and this is very strange

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,850
because if you ask open source

00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,310
contributors and maintainer x' about

00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,290
what the perception is you get answers

00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,870
like these we actually asked people this

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:37,730
is from a study we did a few years ago

00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:39,830
people perceive that demographic

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,800
identity is irrelevant and it's all

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,570
about the code write the code sees no

00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,750
color or gender it's one of the quotes

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,850
we get from open source maintenance so

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:54,170
how is it that there's just so few

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:57,680
minorities in general and women in

00:18:54,170 --> 00:19:00,370
particular contributing to these just as

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,380
an aside regardless of what your

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:07,150
philosophy or political orientation here

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:09,890
is on this issue there is evidence that

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,660
teams that are more diverse in in

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,540
particular software teams that are more

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,340
diverse are more productive we we

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,960
ourselves in our group found some of

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,820
this evidence a few years ago in a study

00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,910
we saw that holding utter confounds

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,610
fixed teams that are more diverse with

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:31,190
respect to gender and/or tenure or

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,570
experience they tend to write code

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,990
faster than teams that are less diverse

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:42,660
again holding other variables constant

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:45,940
there's also this idea that by making

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,800
anything really more inclusive for one

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,260
particular minority you make it better

00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,210
for everyone else I stole this light

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,400
from Anita Sharma and Margaret Burnett

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,770
there are two faculty members at Oregon

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,870
State University in the u.s. the

00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,650
classical example are these curb cuts

00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,410
okay

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,520
these little curb cuts have been

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:08,680
developed for people in wheelchairs

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,520
historically but they've come to serve a

00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:14,200
very wide range of users people on bikes

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,380
people with strollers people with

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:20,170
walking helpers people with luggage and

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,420
so on and so forth so really by making

00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:25,300
our communities more inclusive to one

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:29,950
particular minority we end up making it

00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:31,780
better for everyone else okay so um what

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,420
we do what my group does what I've been

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:37,210
doing over the last few years is looking

00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:39,430
at data that comes from these open

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,610
source communities and we have the

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:45,190
luxury of getting access or having

00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,990
access to large quantities of this data

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,920
we've been looking at this to try to

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:53,380
learn about how these communities have

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,690
been changing what affects these changes

00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,040
have had and trying to understand really

00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,810
if there's anything we could do to

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,670
reduce or reverse some of these negative

00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,860
effects and I want to share a few

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,810
examples of our research with you today

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,120
just to give you a flavor of the kinds

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:10,710
of things we're finding I'm going to

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:14,200
start with an example of transparency

00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,840
here we're looking at these repository

00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,460
badges but before then I want to ask you

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,700
one more time if you will indulge me

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:26,110
could you please tell me what non code

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:30,550
contributions do you see or or do you do

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:33,280
yourselves in open source projects what

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:36,160
is there besides just writing code what

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,040
other kinds of contributions do you see

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,210
or do you value in in open source

00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,210
communities besides code

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,860
I'm gonna leave this on hopefully oh

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,860
great thank you

00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:20,060
documentation is a big deal

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:22,790
marketing publicity triaging Oh support

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:27,820
getter support very interesting Stack

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,820
Overflow that's great thank you so much

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,380
huh documentation is really a big deal

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:41,930
triaging - okay the reason I'm asking

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,790
you this is because of one particular

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,700
new kind of contribution that we're

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,780
seeing people do which is this

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,420
beautification if you will work that's

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,580
happening around open source projects

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,940
adding Sparkle adding glitter to open

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,980
source projects I told you already we

00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:00,200
talked about how these communities are

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,630
very transparent that you get this

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,020
firsthand view into what everyone and

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,210
anyone is doing one particular kind of

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,950
transparency and we call these signals

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,490
we call all these little visible cues

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,900
that are present on these pages like the

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,540
number of stars and the number of

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,340
commits and so on the number of

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,710
followers people have we call these

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,780
signals one particular kind of signal

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,900
that we're seeing pop up more and more

00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:30,500
are these repository badges and some of

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,990
you may have seen these on usually

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,670
embedded in readme pages that are

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,640
displayed on the homepage of an open

00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:41,300
source repository now it's very

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,410
interesting because these signals extend

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,610
by a lot the range of things that

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,040
open-source maintainer x' can choose to

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,660
make transparent beyond the few things

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,840
that are available by default in the

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:58,010
github user interface so we've been

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,900
studying what effects just signaling

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,610
displaying these pieces of information

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:06,740
has on how users perceive these or

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,930
contributors perceive these open-source

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,430
projects to give you a flavor I won't go

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,810
into details but feel free to ask me

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,330
afterwards if you're interested but just

00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,669
to give you a flavor we can detect based

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,009
on the git history

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,320
in control history of these projects we

00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:23,389
can detect when a particular badge has

00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,279
been introduced for example here we're

00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:27,139
looking at a dependency manager badge

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,830
and we can detect one that was

00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:33,799
introduced and we can plot relative to

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,289
this introduction time different outcome

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,019
measures for example how up-to-date

00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:41,149
people's dependencies were relative to

00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,730
when this was introduced say this is in

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,980
one particular package lower on the

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,200
y-axis is better here the fresher the

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:51,139
dependencies are the better and you

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,399
could see how once they started using a

00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,989
dependency manager and they started

00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:56,149
signaling this through a dependency

00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:57,619
manager badge people kept up with their

00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:00,649
dependencies much better and they kept

00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,179
updating them we could do this over many

00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:04,429
projects and we could overlay these

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,369
different graphs which gives us a bunch

00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,619
of these distributions of values which

00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:13,369
we can then analyze statistically to

00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:15,289
reason about trends and changes in these

00:25:13,369 --> 00:25:17,950
trends relative to the intervention and

00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:22,249
this gives us a very robust way of

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:24,230
making almost causal arguments about the

00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:26,779
the value or the effect of these

00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,210
particular interventions I'll give you

00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:32,659
two examples here we looked at how

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:36,830
people's dependencies are becoming

00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:39,139
fresher if at all after people start

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,179
displaying these dependency manager

00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:44,899
badges and you can see a very strong

00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:47,330
effect here you can see that not just

00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:50,269
that these dependencies become

00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,759
immediately fresher but they also remain

00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:55,429
fresher over time this is over a sample

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:59,320
of many tens of thousands of packages

00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:03,080
from NPM so really really big sample

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,690
similarly we looked at the value of

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,820
these continuous integration build or

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,340
code coverage badges and we found

00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:14,330
something really really interesting we

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:20,029
found that users contributors to these

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:23,299
open source packages once these testing

00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:27,099
related badges are being displayed the

00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:30,230
contributors are much more likely to

00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:33,049
incorporate to add unit tests to

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:37,429
with their full request contributions

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:40,130
okay they do this just naturally because

00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,929
the maintainer czar signaling that they

00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,760
care about code quality and they care

00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:47,750
about testing so what I'm showing on the

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,790
y-axis is for every month the fraction

00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,620
of full requests that have been

00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,110
submitted to those projects in that

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,500
particular month containing test cases

00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,360
you can see how after they started

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,090
signaling that they care about testing

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,130
and code quality that people started

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,290
submitting test cases much more and they

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:11,030
kept doing this over time really

00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:13,490
interesting so what about Scala I looked

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:17,870
at this a little bit yesterday and all I

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:21,679
could find is a scholar CI badge on the

00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:24,530
readme page of Scala so before you get

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,130
too excited and start adding all kinds

00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:31,970
of badges to Scala a couple of takeaways

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:34,790
first of all we are seeing that it's not

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,720
just enough to put any badges there for

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:41,540
for these effects to happen it really

00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,540
matters whether the badge is doing

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:47,000
anything interesting or not so in this

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,980
case we're seeing that badges that have

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,929
some kind of underlying analysis for

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:52,940
example a continuous integration score

00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:55,640
code coverage score was have you

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,260
dependency manager score something that

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,390
has some kind of analysis in the

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:01,760
background computing the value that is

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:05,059
to be displayed these have much stronger

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,210
effects than the badges that just

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:09,650
display some random information so this

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,450
means for example if you have a choice

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:16,280
between a support badge like this one

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,460
the one on the the green one this like

00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,049
joint badge just links to the channel

00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,710
where people can can go and ask

00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:27,110
questions the other one the red one not

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,049
just does that but also shows in real

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:33,260
time how many maintained errs are active

00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:35,750
on that particular slack Channel so this

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,750
one has a stronger effect in terms of

00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:42,140
attracting contributors because it's

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,760
harder to fake it also requires more

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,850
effort from the part of the maintained

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,040
so prefer these ones that have some kind

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:52,400
of underlying analysis over over the

00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,230
ones that just link to things also don't

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,050
add too many we're seeing an interesting

00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:00,170
effect here where if you add too many

00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,870
badges to these projects then it takes

00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:05,180
away from the perceived quality and the

00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:07,970
perceived value so here I'm showing you

00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,670
the popularity of these packages the

00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:12,410
number of downloads that they get as a

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,900
function of how many different badges

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,850
they have controlling for other

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,640
confounds and you could see that there's

00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:24,710
a magic number around five or so where

00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:26,240
you get most bang for your buck what

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,550
else could you do with these well for

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:33,220
example we're doing some research at the

00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:35,660
moment looking at what kinds of signals

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,400
potential contributors are looking for

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:41,330
when deciding to contribute to your

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,330
package and one thing that comes up both

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,610
in interviews with contributors as well

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:50,420
as in these models over large datasets

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:52,880
is that people care about the tone of a

00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:55,040
particular community people care about

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,700
how friendly a particular community

00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,520
appears to be so perhaps there's some

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:03,020
room to automatically compute some of

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,000
these and display

00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,530
I don't know sentiment analysis

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,360
politeness course what have you

00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:12,580
something that tells you something about

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,650
how welcoming a particular community is

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:18,380
similarly we're seeing that just small

00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:20,390
things like explicitly asking for

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,930
contributions and explicitly asking for

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,020
help

00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:25,720
goes a long way towards enticing people

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,000
to come and contribute to your project

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:34,480
so small things that make a big

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,850
difference okay so this was transparency

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,860
another quick thing we have been looking

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:44,890
at the ecosystem of Python packages that

00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,480
are part of the pi PI package manager

00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:52,310
and we're trying to understand what

00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,710
predicts or explains whether some of

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,500
these packages will become abandoned so

00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:00,170
here I want to ask you again how do you

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,570
Green libraries when deciding which

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,980
wants to adopt how do you screen them to

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,630
make sure that they'll be maintained in

00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:11,720
the future what kinds of things do you

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:23,960
look for when I just flipped you through

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:26,720
this and while you do this I'll tell you

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,050
a little bit about what we found two

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,850
examples first we looked at the impact

00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:36,440
of transitive dependencies things that

00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,780
direct dependencies have become more

00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,750
visible more salient there's

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,940
infrastructure now on libraries that I

00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:47,420
owe for example or on github them

00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,430
directly to display or direct

00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,770
dependencies but there's very little

00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:54,440
that's visible in terms of transitive

00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:57,020
dependencies arguably the impact of left

00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:59,030
path when that happened was a lot

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,250
because of these transitive dependencies

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:03,530
things that depended on things that

00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,050
depended on left path rather than the

00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:10,880
things that depended on left directly so

00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:14,390
here one argument could be that if you

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,290
have some problems upstream if you need

00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:20,840
help if you need effort then the more

00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:22,400
transitive dependencies you have the

00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,500
bigger the pool of potential

00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,270
contributors that could come in and help

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,760
well what do you think we're finding

00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,640
we're finding exactly the opposite with

00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,730
models the chances of packages becoming

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,070
dormant here and we're seeing that the

00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:39,500
more transitive downstream dependencies

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,560
there are again controlling for media

00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,050
many other confounding factors the more

00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,030
transitive dependencies there are the

00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:51,770
more likely a package the upstream

00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:54,650
package is to become abandoned and one

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,000
possible explanation we're learning from

00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,570
the interviews with the Python

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,070
maintainer

00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:04,670
is that these downstream users the far

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:08,660
removed ones are just as likely to

00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:10,860
complain about issues but they are much

00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,260
less likely to actually do some

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,360
think about it and help so interesting

00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,059
how you know the farther you are from

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,720
something the less you care about about

00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:24,299
it it seems another thing we looked at

00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,000
in this study is the impact of

00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:31,190
commercial involvement in these open

00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,240
source packages so here we modeled

00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:38,370
whether packages have a lot of

00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,670
contributions from people with explicit

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:44,190
commercial affiliations as opposed to to

00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,630
not and what impact that has on the

00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:47,220
chances of the package becoming

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:49,260
abandoned again controlling for all

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,660
kinds of confounding factors what we're

00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:56,309
seeing is something worrying again that

00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,710
these packages with high levels of

00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,809
commercial involvement appear to be less

00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:03,150
sustainable sustainable than the ones

00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:05,419
with lower level of levels of commercial

00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,770
involvement against what you might

00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:10,200
believe otherwise or at least against

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:13,290
what we believe going into the study and

00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:17,010
one explanation that the maintainer as

00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:18,750
we talked to or gave is that while this

00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,690
high level of commercial involvement

00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:24,000
comes with more resources and a lot of

00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:27,570
help in the short term it's also a lot

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,480
more unstable this support can withdraw

00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:33,090
and can go away any time so there's a

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,629
lot more risk that comes with it so

00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:42,020
interesting so the takeaway here is that

00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:46,590
whatever happens in any particular

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:49,379
project is really not just a function of

00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,770
the the local community by the function

00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:53,820
of the much broader ecosystem of

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,980
interconnections and inter dependencies

00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,050
between the dot project and and

00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,820
everything else right so we should be

00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:02,310
looking at the entire ecosystem when

00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,570
we're when we're looking at individual

00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:09,359
projects or packages finally I want to

00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:15,390
talk to you a little bit about a study

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:18,930
we did very recently looking at how open

00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,430
source contributors remain engaged and

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:24,770
more active in these open source

00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:27,140
communities over time so he

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:35,119
this is the last question that I would

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:39,349
like to ask you were there any events or

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:42,500
people that encouraged you to seriously

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:44,810
get involved and stay involved in an

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,790
open source so as opposed to the turns

00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,500
things that might throw you away

00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,740
was it was there anything in particular

00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:54,200
that really encouraged you to to stick

00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,690
around and to become more active was

00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,599
there a person that helped you in that

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,820
sense what kind of role was this person

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,430
in were they was there an event that

00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:07,400
helped you write was there a community

00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:12,320
event like this what was it that made if

00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,460
anything a big transformation on on your

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,240
engagement

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:26,240
with open source and I'll tell you why

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:29,599
I'm asking this here we're seeing coming

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,720
back to this issue of diversity we're

00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:37,760
seeing that women on github disengage

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:41,839
earlier than men do for example here you

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:47,420
can see sorry you can see that say after

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:50,690
12 months about 70% of men are still

00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:55,099
active but only about 60% of women and I

00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:59,420
apologize for this binary gendered split

00:36:55,099 --> 00:37:01,630
here we had to do this because otherwise

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,740
the analysis would have been intractable

00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,920
computationally but we're obviously

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:10,180
aware that gender is much more nuanced

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:14,330
than than just binary who just couldn't

00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:18,890
compute with more categories than tend

00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:20,330
to so okay so a lot of this could be

00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:24,020
cultural and there's been many many

00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:27,920
studies arguing this about open source

00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:32,660
culture for example I'm quoting sexist

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,390
behavior in floss is as constant as it

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,820
is extreme this was an autocracy from a

00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,210
few years ago there's a study that we

00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,580
did

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,130
years ago as well I quote again from one

00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:45,170
of our participants I have used a fake

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:49,490
github handle so that people would

00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:52,910
assume I was male hey by the way before

00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:57,220
you ask gender is not explicitly

00:37:52,910 --> 00:38:01,670
recorded on github we know this but

00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:03,920
people do infer this very easily and

00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,470
very often from things like your name

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,540
and your profile picture again because

00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:11,839
of this high level of transparency into

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:15,589
who you are in open source so this is a

00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,200
ranking of features that open-source

00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:21,740
contributors we surveyed recognized

00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,040
amongst each other and gender is the

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,250
second most visible attribute here after

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,109
programming skills very surprisingly and

00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:32,089
interestingly all right so people do

00:38:30,109 --> 00:38:35,450
really tell this even if it's not

00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:37,760
explicitly recorded another interesting

00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:40,300
study from a couple years ago poor

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,740
request acceptance rates are lower when

00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:47,660
gender is apparent as opposed to not

00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:50,570
easily observable meaning people don't

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:53,240
have AI usually identifiable names or

00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:55,310
profile pictures for both men and women

00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,849
for request acceptance rates are lower

00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:02,180
very interesting you could also argue

00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:05,359
that the platform itself perhaps at

00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,119
times creates the wrong incentives does

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:13,099
anybody remember the longest streak

00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:16,660
feature on github okay a few of you this

00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:20,599
was a feature that was displayed on

00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:24,560
people's profile pages it showed the

00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:27,520
number of consecutive days that github

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,170
has seen you committing to some

00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,070
repositories hosted there so this person

00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:37,280
was very proud to have committed for a

00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:39,290
whole year every single day without any

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,730
interruptions this caused a huge

00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,630
backlash in the community you might

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:47,330
remember people complaining that this

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,660
really creates the wrong incentives it

00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:51,830
motivates people to avoid taking breaks

00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,810
and stepping back and can

00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:55,610
be harmful to the well-being of

00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,870
contributors and therefore harmful to

00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,970
open-source as a whole

00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:01,610
this was the manifesto that started the

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:03,470
entire movement against the longest

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:06,020
streak feature which has since been

00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,930
removed from github pages is not part of

00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:12,620
github pages anymore

00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:15,020
so all kinds of reasons we looked at

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,930
some sociological reasons but might

00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,370
explain why people stick around or

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:21,170
disengage from these open-source

00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:23,290
communities and turns out there's a

00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:26,090
really really rich and interesting

00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:29,270
theory a social capital theory that

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,830
people have been using in sociology for

00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,170
for a long time

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:35,990
it talks roughly about two kinds of

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,240
social capital there's the bonding kind

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:41,930
and the bridging kind the bonding kind

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,300
is about close ties and about community

00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,270
building feeling embedded in a

00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,340
particular community and this causes

00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:51,830
higher willingness to to continue to

00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,710
contribute the bridging kind is about

00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:56,630
getting access to new opportunities and

00:40:54,710 --> 00:41:00,170
new ideas and so on so bridging across

00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:02,600
communities and this provides people new

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:07,580
opportunities to continue their

00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:11,120
engagement so that's all fine but again

00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:14,420
the theory here says that when you have

00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,220
very unbalanced groups like we do for

00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,170
example in terms of gender in these open

00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,990
source communities when you have such

00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:24,020
high imbalance along any dimension

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:26,000
really there's a risk of echo chambers

00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,820
forming and exclusion

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,530
happening where the majority group ends

00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,170
up excluding the minority group whatever

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,240
that may be so here because of the low

00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,000
representation of women there's a higher

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,700
risk for them to be excluded from these

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,970
male-dominated communities because what

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:46,550
the theory would predict so at the same

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:52,340
time the theory explains or predicts

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:55,310
that if minorities are instead part of

00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,750
teams that are diverse not demographics

00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,520
because you know we know that's not the

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,040
case but if they're diverse with respect

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,690
to other attributes like the kinds of

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,870
ideas they have or the kinds of

00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:08,070
information they have available in

00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:11,110
minorities are part of these more

00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:15,040
informationally diverse groups then that

00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:18,160
should provide with a higher engagement

00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,350
and an longer term engagement and here

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,400
the should've especially benefit people

00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:26,260
there are minorities like women so we

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,270
did this really interesting study I

00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:31,540
could tell you the details of fine but

00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:33,400
we looked at a sample of about 60,000

00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,700
open source contributors from different

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,520
communities and we compiled a sample in

00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,220
such a way that this was balanced men

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,440
and women half and half we use an

00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,630
automated gender inference technique

00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,400
here based on people's names which worse

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,770
reasonably well I could tell you the

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,200
details of that but again this is why we

00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:55,720
had to make this assumption of binary

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,000
gender and we couldn't do anything more

00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,830
sophisticated and then we did survival

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,730
analysis on top of this we tried to

00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:06,730
model why people what factors explain

00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:10,090
people's disengagement from open source

00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:12,580
as a whole and we're seeing across the

00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:15,070
board exactly what the theory would

00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:18,730
predict we're seeing that the more

00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:22,540
social capital people build the higher

00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:25,090
they stay engaged so this is again the

00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:28,090
same kind of survival curve shows the

00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:30,520
probability of still being engaged in

00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:34,060
open source in any project really over

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,890
time and here you're seeing how I'm

00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:38,350
showing you two curves one for people

00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,660
with high social capital and the second

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,910
for people with low social capital and

00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,040
this holds for many different ways in

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,480
which we measure social capital but

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,450
we're seeing the same effect time and

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,860
again that people that build more social

00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:54,430
capital they're more successful

00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:56,800
long-term at the same time we're seeing

00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:59,530
this really interesting interaction

00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,680
effect between gender and these measures

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:05,710
of information diversity in these themes

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,530
I'm showing you here curves of the

00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:12,450
difference in survival probability

00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:15,790
between contributors with high and low

00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:18,040
programming language diversity we're

00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,230
using programming language as a proxy

00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,930
for the kinds of information or

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:26,320
technologies or ideas that these teams

00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:28,510
might have access to and you know we're

00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,970
saying that if everybody speaks the same

00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:33,580
programming language in those groups

00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:35,530
people are less informational diverse

00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,030
than if people have a lot of experience

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:39,450
with a lot of programming languages from

00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:41,950
other projects they worked on before so

00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:48,250
two things to note here first of all

00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:52,840
that as you'd expect the curves here are

00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:55,750
always positive so the more of this

00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:58,810
information diversity there is the more

00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,940
people survive this is holds for both

00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:03,760
men and women but second and

00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:06,640
interestingly it seems women benefit

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,160
more from distant men do again exactly

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,380
as the theory would predict so here

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,600
we're seeing that there's no difference

00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,260
in survival probability between men and

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,370
women

00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,660
in roughly the first year or so

00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:23,650
regardless of how much of this

00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:28,960
information diversity there is but later

00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:31,930
on there's a much higher increase in

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,850
survival probability for women that are

00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,070
exposed to these information only

00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:39,160
diverse teams compared to men the women

00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:43,750
benefit more from this information that

00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:50,500
versus even men do so this provides a

00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:52,360
very clear way for us going forward and

00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,970
in trying to increase diversity and

00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:58,090
retention in these communities by

00:45:54,970 --> 00:46:00,390
investing and ways that could help

00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:04,890
people build more social capital and

00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:07,480
fostering these inter technological

00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:10,120
collaborations and so on where people

00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,560
get access to these different ideas and

00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,380
these different technologies and they

00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,580
get it a chance to to learn about new

00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:22,450
things and continue their engagement

00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:26,500
long term so just to wrap up I argued

00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:28,870
that it's hard to create sustainable

00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:31,390
open-source communities it has always

00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,900
been hard but perhaps it's particularly

00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,910
hard

00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:37,990
these days because of the ways in which

00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:40,329
open-source software has changed I shown

00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:43,690
you some of these changes talked about

00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:46,329
high transparency we talked about high

00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,250
levels of demands and stress that are

00:46:46,329 --> 00:46:51,940
being put on the on these maintainers

00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:53,920
talked about this really low demographic

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,720
diversity that's present in open-source

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,359
communities I gave you some examples

00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:01,089
three from our research group of studies

00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:03,190
that have tried to understand these

00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:07,900
problems better and and try to propose

00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:11,170
some solutions to these problems but

00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,289
really we are only beginning to scratch

00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:17,079
the surface of even understanding these

00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:19,240
problems let alone solving them this is

00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:22,480
something that goes well beyond what any

00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,329
single research group could do so really

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,799
I'm here to beg for your help we really

00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:32,260
need your help to understand these

00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:37,750
problems better and even begin to solve

00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:40,299
them so please you know talk to to me

00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:43,000
talk to my colleagues about the

00:47:40,299 --> 00:47:44,740
sustainability challenges that your

00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,970
particular open source projects are

00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:50,680
facing and would love to to think about

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:53,140
those problems together with you and and

00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,579
try to solve them so but this all ends

00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,329
and thank you very much

00:47:54,579 --> 00:47:57,329
Thank You speaker

00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:07,270
so I think we have time for one or two

00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:11,990
questions if anybody is so inclined

00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:14,540
there's one over here the mic is coming

00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:23,420
too I have a hard time seeing you

00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:25,040
because of the lights anybody after okay

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,319
so there's question number two is over

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,980
here and then we can hi you can come

00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:35,180
talk afterwards thank you for you talk

00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:37,819
I'm seeing that that this inclusion of

00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:39,230
minorities is a big thing here at Scala

00:48:37,819 --> 00:48:43,010
- there's also a couple of weeks ago

00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:45,440
where Q come but I was wondering how

00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:47,180
does this exclusion work because I'm not

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,030
really aware that community are

00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:52,790
excluding people and I'm not aware of me

00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:55,880
excluding minorities so I'm just curious

00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:59,119
did you also if you look into how people

00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:02,809
are being excluded yeah so okay so thank

00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:05,390
you that's a good question one thing two

00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:08,690
things I could say one is historically

00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:11,829
in these platforms there's higher

00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:14,990
emphasis being put on code contributions

00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:16,549
over other kinds of contributions this

00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:19,369
is the reason why I was asking the

00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:21,500
audience for what other non called code

00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:24,260
contributions do you do you see do you

00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:27,410
do and do you value in open source so

00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:30,290
this isn't about men versus women or

00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:32,150
about any particular minority versus any

00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:34,309
particular majority but it's about

00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,230
catering to different information

00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:37,849
processing styles and styles of

00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:40,670
contributing and so on alright so

00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:42,880
there's a very wide range in any

00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:45,410
particular demographic group of

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,349
preferences for these things but really

00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:50,119
I think we should be welcoming more

00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:51,740
diverse kinds of contributions and

00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:54,380
valuing them equally that's one thing

00:49:51,740 --> 00:50:01,450
second is there's this implicit culture

00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:04,130
that we're not we're not explicitly

00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:06,349
discriminating or hardly ever as a

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:08,510
community or as individuals we're hardly

00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:11,030
ever doing this explicitly but there's

00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,770
this implicit culture that carried over

00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:15,530
I'm not sure exactly

00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:18,050
from from where but it's the perception

00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:20,900
is there and our studies in other people

00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:23,240
studies and big github open source

00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,640
studies with thousands of people have

00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,730
shown time and again that there is this

00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,230
perception that some of these

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,090
communities and some of these maintained

00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,800
errs are just not welcoming

00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:38,510
maybe you'll in a store vault is one

00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:43,100
example of a kind of interaction style

00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:45,140
that is not welcoming to again not about

00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,880
women versus men but to to anyone really

00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:52,910
right there's only probably a few people

00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:55,300
that like this kind of interaction and

00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:59,120
engagement and seek it

00:50:55,300 --> 00:51:00,410
if one work I think maybe afterwards

00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:05,060
yeah but one more question over here

00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:08,110
before we change sessions do you've

00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,600
talked about sustainability and

00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:13,730
diversity I mean we haven't really

00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,980
acknowledged the the massive hidden

00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,950
subsidy for open source that comes

00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:21,650
through the fact that it takes skilled

00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:25,190
people with the time and space to to

00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:26,690
contribute Apache or get up they don't

00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:28,760
pay your college fees they don't pay

00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,980
your childcare they don't look after

00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,220
your elderly parents and they don't pay

00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:37,580
your rent could you say a few words

00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:39,500
about the sort of economic basis and and

00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,240
how we can actually improve diversity

00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,680
and so on yeah I think thank you so much

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,440
I think that ties perfectly to the

00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,320
previous question I forgot to mention

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,100
that earlier thank you for for asking I

00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,920
think you're right I think that's

00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,410
absolutely part of the problem it's only

00:51:51,920 --> 00:52:00,140
the privileged people if I can say that

00:51:54,410 --> 00:52:03,020
that can afford to do open source right

00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:05,480
now because most other people are just

00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:07,610
busy having real jobs and whatnot then

00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:09,410
and supporting their families and we're

00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,910
not putting themselves through school so

00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,950
they don't have the time or the energy

00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,630
to do this as a hobby right it's the

00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:16,010
people that already have the means to

00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,110
support themselves in their families

00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:20,810
that can afford to put in this extra

00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,740
time and hobby and passion into building

00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:23,990
open-source I think you're absolutely

00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,400
right I don't know how to fix this but I

00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,590
think right

00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,600
okay let's let's thank Bogdan the

00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:35,360
prominent female professor from a Gender

00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:36,890
Studies department and you know thank

00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,600
you again for coming out it was really

00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:41,210
cool so we have the next session

00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,900
