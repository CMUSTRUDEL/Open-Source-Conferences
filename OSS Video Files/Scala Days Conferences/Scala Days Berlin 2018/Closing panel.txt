ladies and gentlemen welcome welcome to

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:16,540
the the final session of Scala days

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:20,320
Europe 2018 it's good to see the room I

00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,840
think it's almost completely full and

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:33,270
I've had a fantastic time if you all had

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:35,559
a good time I think it's I think it's

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,010
for me being one of the most exciting

00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,990
Scala days in in some time and I'm happy

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,230
to have been to so many interesting

00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,650
talks and seen so many fun and exciting

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,030
new ideas coming out and I think anyone

00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,910
should be any doubt that this this

00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:56,230
community and the people in it are alive

00:00:51,910 --> 00:01:01,440
and kicking with wonderful interesting

00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:04,239
exciting intelligence ideas that will

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,990
define the future for Scala programmers

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
for many years to come and I think the

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,670
I'm super excited in particular about

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,590
the the the keynote we had two days ago

00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,810
which I think will set the scene for

00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:19,900
Scala for the next 10 or maybe 20 years

00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,190
so I think this this is this is the

00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,890
moment when a lot a lot will be changing

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,000
and with with changes come challenges

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:32,220
and I think a lot of those challenges

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,880
will be in the form of questions which

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,860
now is your opportunity to ask so I have

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:46,690
a panel here of five wonderful people

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:49,869
from the Scarlet community and five five

00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,700
wonderful humans and dog from the from

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,140
the Scarlet community and I will I will

00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,070
introduce them and I've asked each

00:01:53,140 --> 00:02:01,590
person two questions I would like a

00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:04,869
single word answer to each of these

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,640
starting on on my left is Heather Miller

00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:12,000
a professor at Northeastern University

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,000
and a head of the Scarlet Center

00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:21,230
can we have a round of applause for

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:23,300
hello we will we will have the same the

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,950
same questions for for each person but

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,140
have a guess to start the least amount

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:33,890
of time using Scala which language

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:36,830
should be using PHP the Scala Center

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,440
fail I'll get in touch with PHP Center

00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,090
yeah and if you if you weren't in the

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,580
software industry which career would you

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:49,580
be in one word one word no science okay

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:55,040
cool cool so my immediate left is Kelly

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:58,370
Robinson please welcome Kelly Kelly

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,910
Kelly is the founder of the Scala bridge

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,680
initiative to increase increase

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,830
inclusivity at scholar events and is

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,060
developer advocates at Twilio which

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:16,670
language would you be using if it

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:19,520
weren't Scala Python - and what career

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,440
would you be in were it not for the

00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,310
existence of computer science I would be

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,560
Ina Garten you'd be I know Garten the

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:31,370
Barefoot Contessa you all need to watch

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,750
more Food Network well we've been told

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,910
so by this is my right is agent Moss the

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,770
team lead and light Bend on the on the

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,770
compiler team welcome agent

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:50,440
what language did you choose Scala over

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,410
you know I only have one kid so at least

00:03:50,440 --> 00:04:02,890
people don't ask me which most Omega I

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:04,860
really like Omega well I did I did

00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,160
glanced at your screen so I was prepared

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,660
and which career would you be in if if

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:18,250
light band were to hand you you'll

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:20,890
notice bicycle repairman I think very

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:24,450
very hipster you know I can't grow beard

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:28,270
like you I can repair I can repair bikes

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:32,920
too agent Wright is master ski well

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:38,500
known as the developer of languages

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:42,850
pizza and funnel actually that was the

00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:48,190
answer to right if it weren't for Scala

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:51,370
or dot e or pizza or funnel something

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,710
you had hidden create yourself which

00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,780
language would you choose I didn't know

00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:02,580
that peeps arrow final was excluded and

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:08,520
I would be okay if it's excluded then

00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:12,580
modular three you might say that

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,430
and what career would you be in cobalt

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,980
if I hadn't done soft engineering and

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,980
probably would have become an insurance

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,980
mathematician

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:31,130
well I have to say it's the loss of the

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:34,700
actuarial industry and not quite finally

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,880
but to Martin's rights is Holden and you

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:44,570
are developer advocate at Google on a

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:46,640
big data expert yes great as far as I

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,090
know I have not been hiring folks good

00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:56,150
good

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:58,370
which please welcome Holden and which

00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:06,620
language would you choose were it not

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:12,580
for Scala Python we've had we've had to

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:15,820
Piper so that's one to one to watch and

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:28,630
what career would you choose barista

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:32,450
barista good choice finally we have boo

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:37,970
Julian Taylor is a dog and the author of

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:41,330
learning how to bark please please

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,920
welcome please welcome food and I don't

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,340
know if you could answer on booze behalf

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,770
we've talked about the questions ok so

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:53,720
if if boo is not a computer programmer

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:56,300
she would be a dog and the language she

00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:05,660
would use besides Scala is barking okay

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:10,580
barking okay okay thank you so now that

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:13,570
is our panel and did I miss some oh we

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,910
have we have an owl in the audience

00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:18,560
thanks boo boo is getting excited right

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,840
let's get to the questions I'm sure you

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,900
all you'll have questions to ask

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,290
I have several questions which people

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,480
have submitted on Twitter over the last

00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:33,760
week or so when I when I invited invited

00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,760
but Twittersphere to offer there

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,510
most exciting panel I've ever been on

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,960
right now so does anybody have any

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,360
questions if you if you raise your hand

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,090
a microphone will magically make its way

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,220
to you and meanwhile I will I will ask

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:57,330
one of the questions that has been

00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:03,060
submitted early but nobody has any

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:04,950
questions right I should have opened so

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,070
quick questions about about dotty

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,050
migration - dotty any any thoughts you

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,300
will not answer it at all you yeah

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,310
everyone knows everything let's go let's

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,950
go for the questions that were submitted

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,350
earlier then and meanwhile you can you

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:24,180
can try to think of things and things to

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:26,730
ask so you tinia Carter asked what can

00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,940
scarlet ecosystem do to improve

00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:33,479
accessibility to data scientists

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,490
molecular biologists and quants who

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,430
might dabble into occasional R and

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,110
Python I'm lost holdin this question

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,000
because it seems almost perfectly

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,680
designed for you I swear I did not

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,660
create a fake Twitter account to plant

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,590
questions

00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,920
fakes which we can't with the name you

00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,540
see you do this pretty real that would

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,460
have been a lot more thought than I put

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,810
into things

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,650
anyways no so I think there's there's a

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,580
lot of things that are happening and we

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,830
can do better one of the start of

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,630
improvements is cross-platform

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,310
serialization with Apache Aero and it's

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:15,530
runs on the JVM I think it would be

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,530
nicer if it had a Scala API that was not

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,800
quite so Java 2 Enterprise Edition

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,320
inspired it's like feels very much like

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,510
oh yes now I make a make a row and now I

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,740
called all of these setters and then I

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,400
call some getters and it's just it's

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,140
it's a little ugly but it's it's very

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,020
fast and it makes it possible for people

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,350
to work more efficiently between Scala

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,870
and Python I think multi-language

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,920
notebooks would be a really good thing

00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,149
to see an open source

00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,529
I think there's there's a scholar

00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,820
Colonel but certainly one of the things

00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:52,660
we could do is make a multi-language

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:55,690
Colonel where we seamlessly support

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:58,139
passing but seamlessly also knowing as

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,750
with lots of bugs passing data between

00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:06,269
the different systems and of course

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,269
using the latest version of Apache spark

00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:15,220
I have a sort of more general question

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,199
because I go to a lot of scholar events

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,870
and I meet a lot of people who call

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:22,570
themselves scholar programmers and and

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,769
indeed a scholar program I don't I don't

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,889
meet many people who call themselves

00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:29,230
data scientists if you do but the two

00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:31,480
communities tend not to interact too

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,550
much can you describe because you are in

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:37,000
both fields what is it like over there

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,260
yeah what is it so what is the wall of

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,959
light from the point of view of a data

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,110
scientists if there are graphs and it's

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:48,880
more than just bar charts okay it's one

00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:50,560
time I saw scatterplot yeah I mean like

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,949
there's there's graphing tools there's

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,870
more numerical focus computation tools

00:10:53,949 --> 00:11:02,800
obviously and I mean there's a lot of

00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:05,740
mutating state which makes me sad but

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,130
you know the the graphing tools are a

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,860
lot nicer over in that side of the world

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,779
you also see a lot more people from what

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,640
are traditionally considered like non

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:17,800
traditional computer science backgrounds

00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,860
in the data science space which i think

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,690
is amazing because there are no bad

00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,699
habits that we have to like wean them

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,370
off of like mutating state you can just

00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:29,050
be like no this is normal this is normal

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,329
functional programming is how everyone

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:34,440
does it

00:11:30,329 --> 00:11:39,279
don't go to any other conferences yeah

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,470
ok but the only thing that's missing are

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,720
a lot of the numerical libraries that

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,430
people and are in Python use plus the

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,810
visualization stuff so it's kind of oh

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,120
yeah no they're not gonna become Scala

00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,110
users yeah I mean I don't know this

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,819
seems to me like the biggest

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,470
prerequisite which is something that

00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:55,600
takes decades of I think building

00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,459
libraries for we have some but I think

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,860
not nearly the the critical mass that

00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,279
they

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,290
but but I think arrow is like yet mr.

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,790
era was the hack solution to that where

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,839
I can just start using my Python

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,730
libraries or just start with a tons of

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,370
boilerplate code that hopefully someone

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,589
in this wonderful audience will write I

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,550
can start using my Python libraries from

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,930
Scala and vice versa I like because I

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:28,010
don't want to have to rewrite Fortran

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:29,720
code in the Scala okay second time of

00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,190
asking does anyone in the audience have

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,690
any questions there's a question over

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:38,480
there can the microphone make its way

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:41,450
over there and meanwhile I will ask so

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:46,579
there's a question here from a mr. t mr.

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:49,339
t who says why are we not in a

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:51,410
skittering panic about I'm sure he isn't

00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,870
a skittering panic about the lack of an

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,010
approachable reliable well featured

00:12:53,870 --> 00:13:01,220
editor plugin for Scala Kelly do you

00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,839
have any thoughts on why we're you you

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,250
look like someone who knows about why

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,529
people should or should not be in

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,410
skittering panics I mean my answer is

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:11,089
always yes you should be panicking I

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:14,660
mean I can't speak as much to editor

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,250
plugins but I think the the topic there

00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,040
of something that's accessible and

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,500
useful by the community it ties back to

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,050
a lot of the tooling around Scala which

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,050
thankfully have an organizing a tooling

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,790
summit and there's you know there was a

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,220
conference this year that was completely

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,959
dedicated to Scala tooling but this ties

00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,430
back to some of the stuff that Holden

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,010
was talking about which the tooling and

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,810
Scala hasn't caught up to the tooling

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,579
and other languages I think there's a

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,990
few reasons for that there's not as many

00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:43,870
people that write Scala code as there

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,399
are the people that write Python code

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,500
and I just don't think it's been a focus

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,180
of the community open source software is

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,949
always hard you have to find some way to

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,570
support it and if your company is not

00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:56,690
paying you to do it you're doing it in

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,670
your spare time and it's a hard answer

00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,800
but I think that you know if you work at

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,449
a company that either supports to lean

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,010
or uses to lean that you like try to get

00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:05,600
your company to give you time to work on

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,130
it try to get your company to offers

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,660
financial support if I can

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,480
those are always two great ways to

00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,000
support the the languages that you use

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,339
none of this stuff happens for free and

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,800
just to add to that I think the whole

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,899
effort that I mean you know this maybe

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,100
I'm biased but I'm pretty I'm pretty

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,959
enthusiastic about the whole Scala meta

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,990
development and also the whole semantics

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,510
DB thingy this is something that I think

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,610
it greatly brings down sort of Tabar the

00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:43,250
audience to know about the semantics DB

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:46,370
thingy yeah I don't I mean so you know

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:48,410
in a few words it's basically what you

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,389
know it's a it's right now it's a

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,310
compiler plug-in that basically runs

00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,350
through your whole codebase and it will

00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,510
kind of have this persisted

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,310
representation in like a semantics DB

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,649
file that you can write you can query

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,139
and for somebody who might want to write

00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,420
a tool that asks questions about the

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:07,339
code that you know is in whatever that

00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,410
it's looking at this is a nice way a

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,870
very very low bar way to ask questions

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,980
about about source code and it's I think

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,269
it's a very cool development and

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,459
language agnostic

00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:21,110
well tells me as languages okay

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,430
regardless I mean I you know you know I

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,910
know Olaf is doing a lot of things with

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,980
it

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,620
you know there's scarlet fixes based on

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,240
it and this could be a real enabler for

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,800
tolling in Scala right but I mean you

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,449
know unrelated to this tooling thing I

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,670
mean we have a little bit of experience

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:36,560
actually asking very kind of complicated

00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,839
questions about code patterns across

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,510
many Scala code bases and it turned out

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,560
to be really convenient API to query so

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,760
it's I think it's a really nice

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,889
development that people should look into

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,149
if they're just hidden tooling one other

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,740
thing that Martin talked about in his

00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,750
keynote was the fact that Dottie is

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,160
going to be using and pasty is going to

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,620
be using the language server protocol

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,690
which is a new standard I think it was

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,540
developed by Microsoft yeah and so this

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,880
is going to be used across all languages

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,490
for all editors to hopefully develop

00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,410
standards for making editors and making

00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,850
editor plugins and so that's not

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,089
something that's unique to Scala and so

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,990
I'm grateful that were thinking ahead to

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,120
use something like that

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,040
so speaking of thinking ahead believe it

00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,380
or not as soon as this panel finished so

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,279
I'm going to go into a meeting with

00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,569
several other people from the community

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,570
to talk about LSP and how we can this is

00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:27,300
the working groups that we

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,030
set up for the language server protocol

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,420
and other related build protocols that

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:38,100
are needed to support an active and

00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:41,220
vibrant Scala ecosystem of of tools for

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,130
the next the next many years I hope so

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,750
if you didn't get my email the people

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:49,560
who are on that committee it's happening

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:52,560
after this panel and I'll see you there

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,560
later but just going back to Rob

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,510
Norris's original question or sort of

00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,680
follow on from that question it's there

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,700
anything else that we're sort of

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,380
sleepwalking into other you're just

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,910
accepting his premise here sorry I like

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,230
I wasn't to anything you know we're not

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:08,550
Miss Kettering panic because we're

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,620
actually working on it you know like

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:14,190
let's like it's a very leading question

00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,990
and I disagree with it okay so at any

00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,820
point so I mean we should be thinking

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,140
about what things are important but

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,440
let's not immediate imply that we're

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:27,780
actually not doing it so what are we in

00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:31,520
a skittering panic about being a

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,520
skittering a panic about yeah okay

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:44,250
there's so many things about this just

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,970
say that hyperbole nor pay yes look at

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,790
it just like that

00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:50,700
that's very calming thank you I think

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:54,090
you know hyperbole nor panic I are gonna

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,070
like magically conjure editor plugins so

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:59,190
you know I think things like organizing

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:03,450
the working groups these reasons debate

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:06,180
well you know that and money money you

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,280
know I mean it's it's like the the

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,810
hidden thing here is that no one pays

00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,030
for tooling right and you know I'm

00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,430
sitting here like I'll put my light band

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,870
hat on that I didn't bring it's really

00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,490
hard to motivate people to pay for this

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,620
stuff so it's great that we have this

00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:23,700
call center for example to do this you

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,100
know through the foundation but you know

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,110
why are you not paying this money to do

00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,960
this I mean I don't mean us as in me I

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,060
mean I mean us as in you know if you

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,380
want to drive this road map then well I

00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,290
know way to fund it yeah I think you can

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,170
you can make the observation that's the

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,930
of the other top 10 languages

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,940
programming languages in use today Scala

00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,970
which i think is probably just in the

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,950
top 10 refer Martin it's maybe the least

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,040
well it's just a number

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:56,640
least well-funded in terms of resources

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,370
available so we we're already doing a

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
lot with I think so less less money than

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,020
many of the languages we're competing

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,950
with so I think we deserve a pat on the

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:12,570
back for what we've done so far but we

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:15,110
need more I think and I would point

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:17,580
point to the Scarlet Center as a

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,950
wonderful vehicle for doing that yeah

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,140
we're trying and I think also again I

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,010
just going to mention this thing that

00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,290
we're doing tomorrow

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,060
this contributors yeah thank you this

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,160
contributor summit so I mean the idea is

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,180
to bring together all these different

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,370
parties that care about stuff like

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:34,620
compilers tools libraries that we all

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:37,440
kind of depend on put them in a room

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,240
together and sort of help them all sort

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,530
of you know they understand the

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,790
directions that disparate pieces are

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,430
going and then maybe we can have some

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,040
some agreements about you know ways to

00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,930
go ways not to go and even identify more

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,890
clearly kind of intermediate goals and

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,840
then people could then pick those up

00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,700
adding a little bit more structure to

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,260
how we kind of already do it or it's a

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,850
little more kind of freeform

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,680
so I mean we're trying to do things like

00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,910
this I mean perhaps provide a little bit

00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,040
of structure if anybody does want to

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:05,460
jump on this this crazy bus right into

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,590
tools or libraries or you know anything

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,110
else that we all need and that's taking

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,990
place tomorrow at other still places

00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,610
available yeah if somebody contacts be

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,560
very very soon because I need to give

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,150
these people at solando a list of names

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,740
so they'll let you in the building so if

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,240
somebody wants to go and I have you know

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,550
we haven't talked yet you can send me a

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:28,440
message on Twitter and I can I can put

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:30,480
your name on a list okay yes the mic

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,490
with microphone is is I'm thinking the

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,810
hands of one very patient person we have

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,420
a known and we have another patient

00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:38,340
person over there and I have this

00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:43,350
question first then we'll go the the

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:47,550
person the front yeah thank you good so

00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:50,240
I have just one short question around ot

00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,240
what next

00:20:50,730 --> 00:21:06,300
what's next what next what Scala for

00:20:52,920 --> 00:21:17,130
Scala for my god I describe that as a

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:21,150
very patient person my initial question

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:26,790
was a bit different but are you going to

00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:28,410
to have shorter release period for door

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,080
team for example after we've officially

00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:35,700
release so because a lot are asking what

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:39,720
next so we can't say F release PA a

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,600
release period of six six weeks I don't

00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,710
think we can shorten that further

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,110
century we roll out every new release

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,880
every six weeks so it's time-based and

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,280
whatever is in there is in there I

00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,020
believe we will once it's Carra three we

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,910
will have longer release periods what

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,330
they will be exactly whether it's six

00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:59,820
months or a year or two years it's way

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,070
too early to tell I don't know and it

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,410
depends on a lot of lot of factors and

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:08,460
and is are you expecting this to be new

00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:12,540
features added in Scala 3.1 3.2 yeah

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:18,000
doesn't stop but I mean not anything as

00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:21,420
the jump to from 2 to 3 yes ok and we

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,970
had a question the front the question to

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:29,670
either of you

00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,830
considered opening a patron for us mere

00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:37,710
mortals to sort of throw support to the

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:40,260
efforts around young like a patron oh

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,740
hey yeah so we actually do have a thingy

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,010
or you can throw money towards turns out

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,700
this is not a very long term way to fund

00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,530
anything oh sure but I mean we probably

00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,420
don't know about it to her it's on the

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,950
Scala Center website alright donate

00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,260
button but it's it's a you know these

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,200
are things that they can get pizzas and

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,260
beers but that's something

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,270
yeah but I think though the you know

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,590
just as a footnote this kind of this

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:13,080
kind of you know small irregular

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,670
contributions it's really useful for you

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,900
know collecting money to give towards

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,060
like a community organization or

00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,800
something and that's kind of what I

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,780
would do it for but I wouldn't this is

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,670
you know solving the IDE problem is not

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,320
that way that would not be enough I

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:30,740
think so we should also say to people if

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,140
you're working for a large company

00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,090
developing Scala you can sponsor the

00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:39,450
Scala Center that would be very helpful

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,820
and the the Scala Center very much

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,360
invites sponsors to to support the work

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,620
it does we have eight or nine yes at the

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,160
moment who are providing a regular

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,530
income which is funding the work of

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,970
people that have and Jorge yeah the the

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,830
Scout Center engineers are paid by the

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,770
sort of regular regular donations that

00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,120
come in and one one one thing I think is

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,430
particularly cool about this is at those

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,500
companies they are roped into talking to

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:06,120
us all the time which is good for

00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,460
everybody actually it turns out that we

00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,570
learn a lot about their use cases about

00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,300
you know oh it turns out that

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:14,010
mano-a-mano repos are a big deal yes who

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,090
would have known right that would be

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,550
good that we would be aware of that if

00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,980
we're working on tools right so these

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:23,190
are also benefits we have regular

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:27,660
conversations with Mark Martin is on the

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:30,540
advisory board heather is and it's a way

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,210
for companies to connect to the people

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,760
who are changing things in Scala and at

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,350
the same time support support the

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,510
development of things that we all need

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,800
tools but that maybe one company just

00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,690
can't afford to support by themselves

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,430
like it you can't expect one company to

00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,470
be like right but the model the model

00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,330
works because we have people

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,940
collectively throwing all in their

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:55,520
resources rather than re-implementing

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:59,060
everything themselves multiple times so

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,890
speak to your speak to your employers

00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,950
after it is preferred yes Heather would

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,840
love to hear

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:08,149
what I or Martin wait we're happy to

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,489
provide any more information on the

00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:11,809
Scala center but I mean the district and

00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:13,940
to your point it like sort of how to

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:17,269
fund this kind of stuff is a hard hard

00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:21,950
problem so we could send the microphone

00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:24,019
to Daniella at the front and I will look

00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,649
back over what what else was what else

00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:33,979
was asked on Twitter Justin Justin

00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:35,210
Kaiser asked the question who did he

00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:37,129
didn't want to ask it in person he

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,690
wanted to ask it early what do you think

00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:40,609
of the strengths of the Scala

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:45,970
development ecosystem compared to other

00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:53,960
languages and where should we improve

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:57,859
this Adrian what are you doing well what

00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,479
are we doing badly and I'm really good

00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:01,009
at incremental compilation I think

00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:03,340
that's actually something that we did

00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:05,779
pretty good so incremental compilation

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,029
is that a good thing or a bad thing

00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:12,259
well it's bad that we needed it but it's

00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:14,359
good the way we do it can I ask the

00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:16,609
audience a question huh can I ask the

00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:18,559
audience a question sure how many people

00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:24,979
find the incremental compilation in

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:27,320
Scala good awesome how many people find

00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:29,960
the incremental compilation in Scala not

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:35,599
good you can it's fine three people you

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:38,149
don't see okay yeah no that's in SPARC

00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:38,929
we have different yeah okay we can talk

00:26:38,149 --> 00:26:41,720
about that later

00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,979
yeah drunk but I mean other things that

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,749
I think are good about the Schuyler

00:26:42,979 --> 00:26:46,220
ecosystem I mean in the last couple of

00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,529
years I think that there's been a lot of

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,840
banding together that I hadn't seen and

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:52,070
I'm super excited about that we're

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,279
really good at coming up with new bill

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,279
tools

00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:04,129
Jason libraries and chasten libraries

00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,679
have built built tools of the Jason

00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:08,360
library of 2018

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,429
like the free morning we will see what's

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,450
what's produced by the yeah I mean but

00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,249
there's lots more that we do well right

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,789
we have like Scylla fix we have Scala

00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:20,119
format we have you know I'm something

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,919
that is you know nicer than Java doc was

00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:22,639
in the past but now has gotten a little

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:24,919
bit behind

00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:26,929
Scala doc could use a new coat of paint

00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,419
and I think it's gonna get one there are

00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:30,710
libraries that people use I don't know I

00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,850
mean if you dig around and look at the

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,559
stuff that you know is the most

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,179
dependent on sort of modules in the

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:37,429
ecosystem that we have we have a healthy

00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:41,059
you know pile of libraries that people

00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:42,350
maintain that's amazing yeah I mean we

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,879
could just fall back on Java but we're

00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,649
not there are a lot of people developing

00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,999
and keeping libraries going the repple

00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:50,299
which is another one that we take for

00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:53,710
granted you know we've had it for nearly

00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:58,399
a decade and how long's Java had one

00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:00,529
nearly I don't know does anyone use Java

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,330
here it's it came to Java nine or eight

00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:04,669
or something how long this Java had a

00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:07,100
referal since Java nine one year one

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:09,019
year so good job darling yeah get her

00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,149
get her eight templates are also really

00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:12,740
useful one thing that we could improve

00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:15,169
on though and this is something really

00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:17,809
actionable is adding more getter eight

00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:20,119
templates for sample projects and things

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,379
that people can get started with I was

00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,999
looking at them recently and there was a

00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:25,159
lot that were super out-of-date and so

00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:27,740
if you have a library add a gator

00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:28,999
template yes and not just that but I

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,769
mean I think that one thing that's

00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:33,529
missing in the gator template space is

00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,700
I'm I don't know I don't have an answer

00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:36,499
for how to do this but to help people

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,090
organize them so that other people can

00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:41,299
see that one's outdated maybe I should

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,830
update it because unlike unlike the the

00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:45,590
json library that you love that you

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,470
maintain and nobody else does you know

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,080
of course there's thousands of them you

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,369
know for some reason people have less of

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,629
an attachment to get irate templates

00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,860
it's like a one-off thing somebody makes

00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:56,240
it and maybe they update it once and

00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,889
then everybody else finds it it's two

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,240
years old right and that's not that's

00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:00,590
not a good look but other people are

00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,820
really happy to update those things so

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,399
if we could find a way together as a

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,749
group of people to help each other let

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,309
other people update these good rate

00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:09,470
templates and put them in one place for

00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:11,029
where we call find them I think Gatorade

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,009
templates would be really amazing I

00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:14,149
think that people would would be like

00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:15,679
way more obsessed with them than we even

00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:17,389
are now people use them a lot

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,159
we just need to slap a front-end on that

00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:22,070
there's a there's a wiki page right now

00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:25,279
that's like in search github for the g8

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,789
expansion I find some cool stuff so it's

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,169
a what is missing what do we need to do

00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:33,230
organization organize this organization

00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:35,720
okay so where do we get that from ever

00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,860
you know it's a good question I don't

00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,559
want to like say hey let's build another

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,419
tool but because I don't want to be the

00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,740
one that has you know ridiculous idea

00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:44,240
but I mean I'm sure somebody could come

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,490
up with a cool idea for trying to keep

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,690
these things in one place and you know

00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:49,970
make it possible for other people to

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,399
update them more easily it's got to be

00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:56,240
way so if anyone if anyone would like to

00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:07,940
volunteer completely serious suggestion

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:09,889
I'll volunteer I'll do it no templates

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,119
organ savings my jam if anyone would

00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:16,759
like to help Kelly

00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:20,539
speak to her yeah and we've achieved

00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:23,049
something so Daniela has the mic please

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:25,940
ask us a question so we spoke about

00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:28,190
direct connection donation to the sky

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,869
Center being difficult so something that

00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,119
I've noticed from the writing community

00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:34,999
what they do is that they organize

00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:37,490
conferences that are called PyCon there

00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:40,220
are totally community-driven and

00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:42,649
everyone pays the ticket and all the

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,899
money that is raised goes to their

00:30:42,649 --> 00:30:47,090
equivalent scholar Center would that be

00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:48,649
an option for us so I actually looked a

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:52,940
little bit about their funding model and

00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:53,990
it's so I you know I yeah you can read

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,999
there because it's slowly towards part

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,369
you can read their disclosures I'm not

00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:01,070
sure that the that the amount that they

00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:02,330
get every year from PyCon because they

00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,759
normally just give it to like one-off

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:06,590
projects so like here's 30k for a few

00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:08,480
months to work on this thingy and they

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,649
give it to just different people what we

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,509
have is something slightly different we

00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:13,999
have people who are who are you know

00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:15,769
regularly employed so they need a they

00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:18,740
need a fixed amount right for the year

00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,570
and I mean in order to come up to that

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,279
amounts we need maybe a more regular

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,500
come then maybe one year we you know

00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:26,929
Python doesn't have a we do it in a

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,919
place that is less accessible and there

00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:31,039
are fewer attendees and then what

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,389
happens so I'm not sure that would that

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,399
would work for at least the way that we

00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:37,789
do it right now doesn't mean that oh you

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,710
know maybe we could reconfigure but it

00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:42,590
seems a little more irregular and more

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,450
like focused on paying for projects for

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,000
a chunk for a period of time rather than

00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,269
us where we have people and then we you

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,130
know

00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:51,649
sorry Scala Center engineers we throw

00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,730
them at a problem sorry guys but that's

00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:54,769
kind of how we do it rather than

00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:00,830
throwing money at a problem and a person

00:31:54,769 --> 00:32:03,610
somewhere else okay yeah question handle

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:08,690
effect we send the mic over and

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:11,509
meanwhile I'll ask Adrian a question we

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:13,429
had from Michael Bukhari who said I've

00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:18,049
already made two plans for the Android

00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:22,039
platform with Skylar I presume makes

00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:24,080
question I know I mean like is the

00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:29,179
Android platform to support planning to

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:34,700
support invoke dynamic I don't know yeah

00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:36,769
it's yeah I I know that people are using

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,710
you know Scala 212 on Android you have

00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:41,600
to kind of fuse some tools together that

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:45,320
we don't all provide like as like a nice

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,659
you know pre-configured set of tools so

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,840
you have to do some retro lamb dying or

00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:53,960
something like that or you know compiled

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,059
into dumber bytecode I guess so this is

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,159
a tool chain which exists but there's no

00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:01,220
easy way of we don't really remote it

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:12,110
know we could do better with that I

00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:14,450
think for us yeah it's it seems like we

00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,309
were really mean like to be honest we

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,990
just like well we have to move to Java 8

00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,480
like there's just too much opportunity

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,309
there for us not to go there and once

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,370
you go to Java 8 and Android platform

00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:27,529
doesn't you know you have to you have to

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,480
maintain a back-end specifically so it

00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,210
sounds like the decision to go to Java 8

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,639
has made it harder but not impossible it

00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,979
seemed impossible no I mean work

00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:38,289
you can recompile Java 8 byte code down

00:33:35,979 --> 00:33:41,979
to like whatever android supports right

00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:44,679
now I know the people are doing this I

00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:47,109
haven't you know like it seems it seems

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,909
like we need some effort to just make

00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:51,179
this a little bit more automated little

00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:54,579
bit easier yeah and then Scala could

00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:56,379
dominate the Android platform I mean and

00:33:54,579 --> 00:33:58,839
there's no there's more to it than that

00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:00,759
I think some people make good points

00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,109
about you know the native bet the

00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:03,219
various native backends for different

00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:06,190
languages and what they're actually

00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:08,799
being used for and for example with

00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:10,510
Scala native you could compile like your

00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:12,039
business logic to all the different

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,629
backends that we have and compile it to

00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:15,700
you know whatever native code you would

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:17,889
run on Android and so this is using

00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,549
Scala discolour native to compile to

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:24,039
LLVM which i assume yes and you could

00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:26,409
you could then just you know like you

00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,879
wouldn't develop your GUI in in Scala

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,529
you would use whatever the platform

00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,879
tools are at your disposal because

00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:32,740
there's more to it than just omitting to

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,629
bytecode right you also need all the

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,389
designer tools and you know although I

00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:40,839
know I'm clearly showing that I'm not a

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:42,279
mobile developer but once you have once

00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,929
you have an ability to plug to that

00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:45,549
platform and your business logic is

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,659
there and that's like the bulk of the

00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:49,149
code that you would share between your

00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,250
different applications I think you want

00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:55,029
a native feel on the platform anyway and

00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,619
that's so tightly to so tightly coupled

00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:58,150
to all the other things on a platform

00:34:56,619 --> 00:34:59,619
that we can't really compete with us so

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,440
we're not we're not really going to ever

00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:04,690
be targeting front-end work on on mobile

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,670
but I mean business who is we I mean

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,650
right well yeah I mean this light Bend

00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:11,859
is a company that's focused on the

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,119
server right on the JVM basically so

00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,400
that's essentially what the business

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,440
model is and I think they're not very

00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,180
interested in just porting SCADA if it

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,799
doesn't come with a kind black arm idea

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,299
the other stuff because essentially

00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,579
that's what they do

00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:26,319
so it means but light Bend is not the

00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:28,420
only company out there that does things

00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:30,369
yes so and we have the community and so

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,990
it just by the fact that light Bend

00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:34,029
doesn't do something like what Android

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,529
port doesn't mean I'm certainly it

00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:38,140
doesn't mean that we think it's not

00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:41,529
important or we want to neglect it or

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:43,410
any business opportunity here for cub

00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:46,190
but for a startup that wants to provide

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:50,540
Scala on and

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:51,890
on mobile maybe we can pull you already

00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,690
get really excited about the audience

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:56,240
what their experience is like whoo yeah

00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:58,130
development and how do you do it so

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,760
after the next question which i think is

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:03,710
is over there feel free to put your hand

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,450
up and add any comment to you to that

00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,319
because we'd be interested to hear so

00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,480
the mic

00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:09,319
hopefully it's over there now please go

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,869
ahead Hey

00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:15,380
so my question is kind of related to

00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:17,000
what Eugene alluded to so like personal

00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,730
observation from the industry is that

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,130
spark is the gateway drug to Scala and

00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:25,130
we are in this elephant in the room

00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,410
situation at the moment and you know

00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,319
spark is very much behind it the current

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:33,349
scale releases and Scala is moving

00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:36,290
forward towards three four boom what's

00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:40,369
going to happen are we going to help the

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:43,730
SPARC guys catch up what that's I think

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:45,290
that's an extremely good question so

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,619
those of you that aren't familiar spark

00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,089
is still targeting Scala 211 and Scala

00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:56,540
211 was released

00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:58,460
how long ago agent can't remember the

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:02,780
length of agents you know which is short

00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,220
these days I admit but like four I think

00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:12,290
there we have someone who knows very

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:13,849
well suited to we're actually just

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,220
talking about this before that while

00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:17,510
during the started a panel yeah yeah but

00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:20,810
in the part where the microphones were

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:24,670
not live perhaps more intentionally yes

00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:30,039
you record it now yes

00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:32,260
hello boss person it's worth this work

00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,819
involved in migrating from Scala to

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,589
eleven there is but it's it's not

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:39,400
insurmountable work the amount of work

00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:42,490
is relatively small I think the

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,769
challenge has been finding a way for our

00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:47,710
communities to work together because

00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:53,440
some of the SPARC community is perhaps

00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:56,859
less focused on the evolution of Scala's

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,319
and then perhaps the people here wish we

00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:02,440
were and I think I think it's work that

00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:04,210
we can find a way to do and we're

00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,190
actually we'll probably talk about it at

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,099
Scala days New York there's a spark

00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,200
summit next month before Scala days New

00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:15,400
York we're gonna try and get some of the

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:19,059
spark people aligned and then we'll try

00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,700
and solve this problem like not the code

00:38:19,059 --> 00:38:23,680
part but the human part of the problem

00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,180
yeah in Scala days New York and then

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,430
hopefully we can solve the code part

00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,900
it'd be the month after but of course

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:35,049
I'm an engineer so take all of my

00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:37,480
estimates and like I think I mean at

00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:40,480
least so Reynold popped up on the Scala

00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,730
contributor forums and started working

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,299
through with I can't remember somebody

00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:49,299
else from that from the SPARC group and

00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:52,690
Adrian and and Jason popped in and there

00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:55,119
was you know some discussion about well

00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,190
this is Sam's and all that but I mean

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,069
you know it seemed like you know

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,720
movement which is step zero yeah yeah

00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:04,720
yeah so I mean since we're on the record

00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:09,759
like we we talked to them from before

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,680
212 was a thing and we were kind of not

00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:14,349
entirely maybe in agreement on how we

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,910
wanted to do things but you know we were

00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:18,880
very much involved in those discussions

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:21,430
and they have very different

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,359
ABI constraints that most scholar

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,890
projects where I understand that you

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,920
know like the Scala defined thing as

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,660
consume you know different trial

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,029
versions are have to be consumed by by

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,470
by Java and so on and so the the

00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:38,330
solutions that we had for them that work

00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:40,730
for most Scala projects migrating to 212

00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:43,550
weren't really solutions for them and I

00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,119
mean number be on the record is we're

00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,119
happy to help

00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,730
you know we offered help and I think

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,860
it's true that it's it's a it's a social

00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,570
problem to to find the time to sit

00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,360
together and figure it out it's the

00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:59,480
problem that Scala 211 is good enough

00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:02,090
then see you to problem yeah so well

00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,580
four or five years ago so I want to say

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,280
as as one of the so I'm a spark

00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,110
developer but the community is

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,820
complicated in similar ways to how the

00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,380
scala community is complicated so when

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:14,600
you say you've talked to them you you

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,980
probably talk to the people at one of

00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,510
the primary companies you talk to the

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,000
librarian equivalent for spark yet you

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:24,260
talk to data breaks and I no longer work

00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:27,310
for data bricks but I work for someone

00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,540
else and I still work on spark and so

00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:46,880
where was I going with this before I put

00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:48,140
my mouth clapping it'll come yeah so

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,369
something about spa I mean I think I

00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,020
think you're gonna talk about like the

00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,400
tensions between like two different

00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,720
communities at Sparta and Scala is a

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,160
small one and they have lots of other

00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,600
fires to fight maybe something along

00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,090
those lines I think that's true I think

00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,070
oh wait so no as an ml developer there's

00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:04,220
a bunch of things in Scala 2:12 that I

00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:05,720
know I really want and like there's in

00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:11,680
Scala 2:11 there's some like really

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:14,780
annoying helpfulness with macros and I

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,369
can't use them right now and so I want

00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,380
us to upgrade so there are people and

00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:20,990
during the community we heard that a lot

00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:24,290
who really want to up there and so it's

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:27,320
it's about we use consensus voting which

00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:29,119
is great so we have to have a consensus

00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:32,390
so it's a casting casting our minds

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,859
forward maybe three years when Dottie is

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:38,480
available Scott Skiles 3 is available

00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:43,700
and spark that's made it on to scarlet

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,109
212 by then possibly will it be easier

00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,530
as a moderator who's supposed to be

00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:49,970
neutral there just like that

00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:54,710
it's all it's all speculation you or

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:56,810
your freed - okay contradict let's let's

00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:02,210
optimistically assumed Scott sparks made

00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:05,450
it - Skylar - 12 and that's better will

00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:07,220
it will it will it be does the panel

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:10,070
think it'll be easier or harder to get

00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,560
onto da sea I actually think it'll be

00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,270
easier pirated things that they're

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,160
struggling with were like you know low

00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:20,119
level platform things that the the way

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,550
that we encode lambdas are did change

00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,260
pretty fundamentally you know that's

00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:29,090
what I talked about earlier also which

00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:31,490
is difficult with Android now and that

00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:35,270
won't change for the foreseeable future

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:39,260
so I think I mean I don't know I mean I

00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:40,910
I doubt it would be harder the thing

00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:44,359
that remains hard as the ecosystem right

00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:47,540
spark has a ton of dependencies I think

00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:50,840
most of them have of gated by now we

00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,410
have for a while that was a really good

00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,869
excuse

00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:59,060
now it's just you guys holding the

00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,740
entire community no I meant it's like

00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:07,850
it's a Californian ism that I picked up

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:10,520
I lived there it means other people may

00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:11,330
be always misunderstood I don't know but

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,760
on that note about the ecosystem

00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,710
Adrienne mentioned that you know okay so

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,910
perhaps it's gonna be easier to through

00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:24,460
boss for the

00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:24,460
[Laughter]

00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:30,900
so Adrienne made this point about about

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,290
the ecosystem and perhaps you know

00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,000
you'll have spark that has you know

00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,770
umpteen zillion dependencies and maybe

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,810
it can't move then maybe the spark

00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,380
source code might be easier to migrate

00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:45,150
from Scala to whatever to Scala three

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,100
because there are fewer low-level

00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:51,630
platform details that have to be you

00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,890
know worked out but you know if this is

00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:54,630
this is an issue this is something that

00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,220
you know you don't we don't have as a

00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,860
community we don't have to leave two

00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,380
data bricks or light bends or I don't

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,700
know choose a company alone I think that

00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,010
a lot of people who are maintainer of

00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,960
open-source projects even like some some

00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,570
library that's not frequently updated

00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,250
that spark depends on the people who

00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:14,220
maintain that thing infrequently would

00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,720
be extremely thankful and then some

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,040
subset of the SPARC community and the

00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,290
Scala tune to be extremely thankful if

00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,930
somebody helped them upgrade and anybody

00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,670
can help help a library upgrade so I

00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,230
mean this is just a you know a general

00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,340
point I need you know you you if you

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,670
have a github account you can help any

00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:31,290
library upgrade and you know as a

00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,550
community I think we you know when these

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,060
things start happening I think we should

00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:36,750
just keep that in mind we can all help

00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:40,070
okay

00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,070
any more questions from the audience

00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:48,500
there's someone in the back can you wave

00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:52,230
at me so I can see you over there yes

00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,000
yes hi I'm gonna switch the topic have

00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,560
some question because I had some

00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,920
discussion about how to teach

00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,780
programming and especially what language

00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,010
to choose and you can use object

00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,290
orientation for that and you can use

00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,240
like functional programming or even

00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,369
Prolog or something and I think that's

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,170
quite important because it has an impact

00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:13,650
in about how people think about

00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:16,320
programming in general and lot of

00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,940
languages that I used to do that have a

00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,760
restricted feature set or something

00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,000
which is certainly not true for Scala so

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,859
the question is how good is Scala to

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,990
learn programming like first learn

00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:29,940
programming why why not what are your

00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,590
thoughts on that so I have a you did a

00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,780
roundtable discussion

00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,760
actually I Martin had entered a similar

00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,200
question I mean I could rephrase the

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,930
answer I could just point at him and

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:45,050
make him say it again go for it Martin

00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:47,160
okay so I definitely wouldn't do

00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:48,990
object-oriented or logic programming in

00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,810
first year I think functional

00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,280
programming is definitely something very

00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:56,130
promising and the one thing where I'm

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,420
not sure is that I mean if you get the

00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,130
first time your hands on a computer

00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,250
maybe you want to sort of have an easy

00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,590
way to manipulate things like I don't

00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,690
know real things little robots or things

00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:09,210
like that so you will have to deal with

00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,920
if the boundary where computers do

00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,830
things rather than compute functions

00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,360
fairly quickly but that's it I still I

00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,270
probably would start with functional and

00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,500
then after some months eight weeks or

00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,850
something like that introduced

00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,070
imperative in order not to be

00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:24,780
essentially too much on the on a

00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:27,240
functional side and I believe Scala is

00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:29,850
an excellent language for that it's

00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,340
definitely bigger than some of the

00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:34,800
academic languages like scheme but I

00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:36,780
guess scheme is thought that much

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,640
anymore but it's actually smaller than

00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,350
essentially all the commercial choices

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,030
out there so in terms of essential

00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,460
features to teach I believe Scala is

00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,990
actually more regular and smaller and it

00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,910
would make some makes a very nice

00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,740
teaching language so I know some

00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,500
universities who teach you first here

00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:54,840
but I think it's not enough I mean sure

00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:57,030
there should be many more and right now

00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,740
the trend seems to be very much towards

00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,710
Python in first year which is also very

00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,090
very decent teaching language and there

00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:07,800
the question is just essentially do you

00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:10,200
want to start with dynamic languages or

00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:12,180
do you want to introduce types first and

00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,460
there it's very much depends as ngr

00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,830
types something that help you program or

00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,450
types that are a hurdle to overcome and

00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:20,190
I believe if you do it the right way

00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,410
then types actually help you program

00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:24,780
like if you start programming let's say

00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:26,430
with a wrapper then typically is you

00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,290
write the expression the retro gives

00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,970
write the types in the answers and I

00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:32,340
mean the more info you have about what

00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,890
you do particular at the beginning the

00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:37,890
better so types definitely can help if

00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:41,490
it's done the right way but so you heard

00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:42,490
it here first types can help they came

00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,160
first

00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,050
can we send the microphone over here and

00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,260
meanwhile I will there's microphone

00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:52,540
already Oh already there okay go go for

00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,940
them yeah when you have this transition

00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,340
from Scala to true SCADA 3 that will

00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,650
kind of break a lot of things and we've

00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,690
seen it like in path of community and in

00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:04,840
rural community that they did this

00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:07,390
switch to Perl 6 or Python 3 and they

00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,390
essentially ended up maintaining the

00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,280
previous version forever so what is

00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,540
Scala's way to deal with this issue

00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,869
especially if you say you have

00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:20,170
difficulty finance sinning and manning

00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:22,480
or having people for doing already the

00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:24,550
stuff that you need to deal do now this

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,640
this was this was a very popular

00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:30,810
question on Twitter as well

00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,610
it's Carla going the Python way with

00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:37,600
with with 2 point X and Dorsey

00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:40,780
so this was address partly in the in the

00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,260
keynotes yeah let Martin answer but I

00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,360
just

00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:49,540
I'll say job security first and then you

00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:51,340
can thank so I believe the the the big

00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,940
game-changer here is really static types

00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,410
which gives you very fine-grained

00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,960
rewrite tools that you can apply to your

00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:01,030
code and you can essentially rewrite

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,180
your call code with a lot more

00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:06,460
confidence than in a case like Perl or

00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,530
Python where of course I can rewrite my

00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,210
code but then I mean how do you know how

00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:13,780
do I know the thing is still correct and

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:16,000
one guideline for us is to be super

00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,920
super careful and if we can avoid it at

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,830
all we right now we are about 90%

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,020
towards that call is to change runtime

00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:25,150
behavior because that's precisely that

00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,210
the problematic point that you say well

00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:30,010
it's sort of one thing to say you have

00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:33,070
to express yourself slightly differently

00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:35,080
here and if not then you will get a type

00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,910
error and there will hopefully be a

00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,440
rewrite tool that actually does it for

00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,840
you automatically to bring code across

00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,150
or if not and maybe you will have to do

00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,400
maybe one change per thousand lines or

00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,140
something like that that's the goal and

00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,420
it's a completely different thing to say

00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:51,400
well we write your program and then good

00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,540
have good luck debugging it because it

00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,720
won't I work anymore and you have to

00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,640
what did this so I think that plays in

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,740
our favor and I believe that actually

00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,430
makes the whole thing feasible so that's

00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:05,590
my hope

00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:08,000
do you have any concern that providing

00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:12,500
tasty which allows people to continue

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,590
running Scala - as for macros for

00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,840
example does that remove the pressure

00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:20,420
from upgrading and forces into a

00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,450
situation where we are maintaining Scala

00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,620
- but this may be to Adrian Moore but it

00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:26,150
removes a little bit of pressure

00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,950
initially which i think is good because

00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,810
it gives us a longer runway to kind of

00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,720
you know bootstrap the ecosystem and

00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,940
gradually introduce Col 3 well you know

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,010
I mean for every scholar released the

00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,500
problem is you have to get all your

00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,210
dependencies upgrade it or you can't

00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,730
upgrade wouldn't it be great if you

00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,320
already can start using Scala 3 even

00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:46,910
while you're still using a few - 14

00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:48,980
dependencies in there and then gradually

00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,780
they start getting replaced so because

00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,630
we know if we have window transition

00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:55,250
yeah well you know that's that's

00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,140
something that the history books will

00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,570
you know record eventually

00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:02,120
well I'm sure - the history books are

00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:03,590
still being written yes well we have

00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,880
been 10 years in and we've been warned

00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:06,560
and I think you know like the point that

00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,510
Martin make Susannah is an important one

00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,020
and the other one is that we've been

00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,210
warned

00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:13,820
you know we've seen what happens at

00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:16,250
Python 3 and I think with all respect

00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:18,680
there's a lot of kind of gratuitous

00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,770
changes maybe that users didn't see the

00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:24,230
benefit of that snuck into Python 3 that

00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,120
end up you know accumulating to a huge

00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,310
paper cut like you know we can do a few

00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:31,760
ones but you know eventually you die if

00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,930
you get you know enough of them and so

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,090
we've we've known this for a long time

00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:36,800
and worried about this believe me for a

00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,660
long time and so we've been trying to

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,670
introduce those smaller changes ahead of

00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,620
time so we're not you know saving them

00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,870
up for 3-0 and say hey here's a bunch of

00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:47,029
random stuff we're giving you to random

00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,910
stuff now

00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:51,529
so you know you've already upgraded to

00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,660
212 so some of the random stuff is in

00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:55,670
there like 213 like I said during the

00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:59,920
keynote well no actually my talk which

00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:02,660
is kind of like a keynote tell yourself

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,190
it was my first real Scala days talk so

00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:12,859
you know it don't bring me down it was

00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:17,029
you know anyway so like the collection

00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:18,440
library is already like in 213 our

00:52:17,029 --> 00:52:20,569
commitment is that actually the standard

00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:23,690
library between 2 14 and 3 0 will be

00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:25,549
identical which is kind of a requirement

00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:27,049
if you're going to you know use tasty to

00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:29,539
cross compile like if the library's

00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:30,680
different you're still you know not

00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:33,410
going to be able to interoperate between

00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,329
different versions all the exciting

00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:37,099
stuff will come in 3-0 and all the kind

00:52:35,329 --> 00:52:42,200
of boring paper cutting stuff is coming

00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:43,369
you know that's that's my job ok so

00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,069
we've got time for one more question

00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:49,730
from the audience if anybody has any

00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:51,559
more questions but the handle over there

00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:55,160
there's another if in the back there -

00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:57,740
well that's - but this one very short

00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,299
answer this one over here will be first

00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,349
but meanwhile I'm going to ask Kelly

00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:02,390
the question was you've been quiet

00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:05,029
here's the microphone already though -

00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:09,470
too soon I've got a question for Kelly

00:53:05,029 --> 00:53:11,420
oh this one came in on on Twitter what

00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:13,010
can we do to be more inclusive in the

00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:17,359
scarlet community what are we doing

00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:21,559
badly or doing wrong I'm gonna focus on

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,450
actual things I think education is a big

00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:25,730
part of it

00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:28,010
tutorials Doc's that kind of stuff

00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:30,590
matters

00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:33,980
there's tools out there that help with

00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:36,280
this I think we all can write tutorials

00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:39,200
for the stuff that we do I think

00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:42,800
educating our peers on how to use Scala

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:47,290
in a way that solves real problems is

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:50,300
important and not just how you applied

00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:52,130
free functors and tackle s-final to your

00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,470
latest project because you felt like it

00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,940
I think we see a lot of conference talks

00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,990
that you know are doing that kind of

00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,430
stuff and this is something and I

00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:01,550
focused on a lot in the last couple of

00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:04,280
years is people that want to write Scala

00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:06,080
for the sake of writing fun code and not

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,700
fun in the central function functional

00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,859
but fun in the sense of they can

00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,500
enjoyment out of it and that's fine I

00:54:09,859 --> 00:54:14,510
love to code too but especially for our

00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,830
day jobs most of us are trying to solve

00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:22,400
problems and I think focusing Scala back

00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:25,250
on solving problems and the tools that

00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,119
we can use to do that and sharing the

00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:30,950
knowledge through blog posts tutorials

00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:33,230
conference talks that fall into that

00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:34,369
blue sky area so we have all the

00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,140
tutorials that are like how to do

00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:37,850
HelloWorld and Scala and then it jumps

00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,980
to like how to do free monads in Scala

00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,900
and so this is something that there's

00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,400
some space between those yes this is

00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,170
something that Jessica Kerr called out

00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,210
like three or four years ago at a Scala

00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:47,690
exchange which is this idea of blue sky

00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,609
Scala

00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,560
and there's not enough of that and I

00:54:49,609 --> 00:54:52,970
think there's this intermediate gap that

00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,630
a lot of people are aware of is like

00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:58,760
okay I know how to like write an API in

00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:00,980
Scala or maybe like my first you know

00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,420
HelloWorld function but where do I go

00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,950
from here and I think that's some of the

00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,900
stuff that we're missing and that's

00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:08,290
gonna help make the community more

00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:11,300
inclusive because that's going to

00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:14,119
increase the the knowledge gap of people

00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,830
that aren't doing category theory for

00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,930
fun so if you think there's an

00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:20,180
over-representation for example

00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:23,119
conference talks of yes some of the more

00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:26,000
advanced stuff that only appeals but

00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:30,740
it's a solution to stop doing that or to

00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:33,320
just promote CV I'm quite easier or more

00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,880
practical pragmatic even I mean I think

00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,320
it's I think it's interesting like the

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,460
stuff that I've talked about is usually

00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,020
it has to do with like the more

00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,100
pragmatic stuff and I feel like people

00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,600
always are coming up to me

00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:43,820
like oh my gosh I wish more people would

00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,890
talk about this I'm like you should like

00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:48,710
I try to encourage other people to do

00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:50,090
this and so I do think there's an

00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,440
over-representation I think that's

00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:53,630
interesting to folks that I don't think

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,850
that that should go away but I think

00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:58,310
especially events like Scala days that

00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,410
have a much more broad audience that we

00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:02,240
should see more of the the project base

00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:05,150
the more how I solve this problem type

00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,350
talks okay thank you so there was a

00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,220
question over there and there's not

00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:09,350
alone today we're gonna take both of

00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:10,070
them but these will be the last two so

00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:13,490
please go ahead

00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:16,870
my question is to all the speakers I'd

00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:19,250
like to know can you recommend the book

00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:23,960
everyone here should read the one

00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:26,000
scholar or computer science maybe so

00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:28,340
book recommendations right all from

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,510
right well one I know the one of them is

00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:34,010
learning how to bark bye boo right the

00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:40,370
royalties are insane on that one

00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:42,530
so high performance part is not directly

00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:46,910
about Scala but I do make a lot of money

00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:50,330
on it for the record I recommended this

00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:51,560
book to my students that's where all

00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:56,000
those sales are coming from every

00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:01,760
semester if anyone's a professor please

00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:05,300
make it required reading Boston I'm also

00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:14,300
partial so I skip okay just read my my

00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:16,280
pieces or something blog post blog posts

00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,610
are great I can't read an entire book so

00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:21,920
go find a blog post okay I like I mean

00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:23,240
so I think you know the programming in

00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,070
Scala book you know there's a few of

00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,300
these books that I think everybody kind

00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:28,160
of already knows but one book that maybe

00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,170
is not so popular that everybody talks

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,190
about all the time is I think the Scala

00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:33,200
cookbook is really nice

00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:35,930
by Alden Alexander it's like this big

00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,270
and it's it's it's really nice I mean

00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:40,520
you know if you forget how to read some

00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:43,400
stuff in from a file they will show you

00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,900
I mean all these cute little things he

00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,280
has a really great blog and every time I

00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,840
Google how to do something install that

00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,940
almost always ends up on our own Alvin

00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:52,970
Alexander's blog yeah

00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:56,089
it's yeah very hands-on okay so a number

00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:58,339
of number of suggestions there and final

00:57:56,089 --> 00:58:00,160
question which hopefully is somewhere in

00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:02,960
that area do you have the microphone oh

00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:11,450
can look in the microphone head that

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:15,440
that way please oh it's you tonight I

00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:18,049
didn't realize it was here yeah yeah

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:21,770
first I want to just thank the panel for

00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:26,420
the great discussions and the question

00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:28,670
is the wood skull last binary

00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,740
compatibility breaking Scala because a

00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:33,770
lot of discussion we've talked about

00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:36,770
today is sort of like that right so what

00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:40,490
if we're really successful in year 2021

00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:43,099
or 22 would the library now be released

00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:45,799
and to still the Maven central in the

00:58:43,099 --> 00:58:48,079
form of tasty and would we still be

00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:50,210
talking about let's say spark migration

00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,710
for spell 3.1 like how does the library

00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:57,140
ecosystem actually look like it's a good

00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:58,730
yeah so that that's really the the idea

00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:01,720
or the vision that would be great if we

00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:05,150
could pull it off that all artifacts are

00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:07,849
published as tasty and that means we

00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:11,750
essentially have complete control of

00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:14,599
binary compatibility and we can actually

00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,920
then fix the problem once and for all of

00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:17,779
course it still requires a lot of

00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:21,380
discipline that means you have to

00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:23,690
essentially evolve the format only in a

00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,520
backwards compatible way let me just

00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:29,690
just what Oracle does with the Java

00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:31,339
platform and also for libraries I mean

00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,900
there would be certain rules still that

00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:34,430
you can't just rename a method to

00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,470
something like that that of obviously

00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:38,539
wouldn't be binary compatible but I mean

00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:40,970
all the all the other stuffs that we

00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:43,490
have now sort of forced on us we're

00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:45,710
essentially adding a new Val - a try it

00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:48,069
as a binary incompatible change all that

00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:50,599
is essentially the semantic gap between

00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:53,000
what we want to express in Scala and how

00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:54,529
we encoded in it in the JVM and these

00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,700
things these sort of accidental

00:59:54,529 --> 00:59:57,680
breakages

00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,960
we can avoid all of them and I think

00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:02,500
that's definitely

00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:05,960
would be a great goal to achieve yeah

01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:08,630
well I mean yeah I agree

01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:11,510
I think it also a pity to stop removing

01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:13,190
stuff and stop changing things so I

01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:14,630
think it is a cultural there's a

01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:16,010
cultural aspect to it as well I think

01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:17,780
that you know all those people

01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:19,250
advocating Mona repose and source

01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,920
dependencies like you're basically

01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:23,900
taking this on implicitly saying like

01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,119
I'm just going to evolve my code with

01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:28,070
along with everyone else's so if we move

01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:29,960
towards a world that's more like that

01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:32,599
then we probably actually will see more

01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,160
breaks more more breakage but also more

01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:36,230
fluid fluidity

01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,060
yeah Gration and better to Lee and I

01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:41,630
don't know yeah well I mean III think

01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:43,970
it's a scary world actually to do it

01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:45,440
that way but I think we have to find

01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,420
some compromise between being able to

01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,760
still remove stuff and maybe deprecation

01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,560
cycles are enough but I'm very excited

01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,960
to get rid of the gratuitous binary

01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,849
incompatibilities that we suffer now do

01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,859
you think that the experience that we're

01:00:55,849 --> 01:01:02,300
all gonna go through if migrating from

01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:05,050
Scylla to for next Scylla 3 will give us

01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:07,190
the the tooling we need for

01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:08,770
compatibility migration to be just much

01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:11,150
less of an issue for us in the future

01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:13,849
it's gonna teach us and force us to

01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:15,560
develop it yeah I mean so as engineers

01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:17,599
we always focus on you know how can we

01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,490
fix this with to take more technology

01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,900
right and so scholar fix is another

01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,460
interesting thing like libraries could

01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:25,670
come with their own recipes on how to

01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:28,180
upgrade to the next version you know I'm

01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:31,010
just looking at the time we can I guess

01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:32,630
keep talking about this but I don't know

01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:37,010
how strict we are in Germany on like

01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:38,839
ending times and stuff if anyone else

01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:43,730
has anything else to say on that

01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:51,080
particular question you're welcome to

01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:53,060
now if not then on the on the evolution

01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,250
part so let's say okay we want to

01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:57,920
sometimes evolve libraries in backwards

01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:00,140
incompatible ways again the great

01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,670
promise of tasty is that because tasty

01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,080
is the format for essentially all our

01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:04,790
meta programming the macros and

01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,890
everything then it means you can take

01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:08,460
the published artifact and essentially

01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,990
publish a

01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:12,359
automatically right tool that

01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:14,160
essentially brings us forward you can do

01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:15,450
this of course with sources as well you

01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,829
can publish the diffs but then

01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:18,390
essentially you have to sort of a pewter

01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:21,000
everyone that they built this again

01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:22,680
because source is in the world at least

01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,799
on the JVM that's not the world where

01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,960
you publish the artifacts I think if you

01:02:25,799 --> 01:02:29,819
can do this with binary then that that's

01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,859
another big big advantage of course I

01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:34,619
don't want to say that we shouldn't also

01:02:31,859 --> 01:02:37,680
try with source can only do with source

01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:39,210
but I believe that the bed the more

01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,289
tools we have available for that the

01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:44,970
better great so that is all we have time

01:02:43,289 --> 01:02:49,160
for I'm afraid that is that is the end

01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:49,160
of Scala days Europe 2018

01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:11,740
so I I I would like to finish by saying

01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,740
thank you to our panel Heather Miller

01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:22,570
agent moss

01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:22,570
Martha jerski hold on

01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:37,849
and thank you thank you John for the as

01:03:28,109 --> 01:03:40,950
always super professional moderation and

01:03:37,849 --> 01:03:42,900
I would like to say thank you to the the

01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:44,730
speakers we've had many many wonderful

01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:51,839
talks over the last few days to please

01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:54,180
to them around the floor thank you to

01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,650
the the sponsors I hope you've had a

01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,190
chance to speak to many of them while

01:03:55,650 --> 01:03:58,680
you've been here

01:03:56,190 --> 01:04:00,269
they do make this event possible without

01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,930
