	00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,510
but I really wanted to start out by

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:15,059
talking about what I think of as an

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:16,920
ongoing love affair with Scala which is

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,070
weird because I'm not really programming

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,079
anymore although for a long time that's

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,720
pretty much all I did all I wanted to do

00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,099
and now I have to think about other

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,649
stuff but one of the things I think

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,960
about is how to really enable people to

00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,239
do the things that they love certainly

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,300
you know in this industry at this moment

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,420
of time it's kind of a magical thing

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,309
because we can really get paid to do the

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,190
things that we love and it's it's a very

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,809
nice life and solving problems and

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,210
engaging with what you do is an

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,949
incredible privilege and for me it's

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,749
become something of a privilege to

00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:56,550
enable this to happen and so good to

00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:58,890
said we're shaped and fashioned

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,230
by what we love and somehow when I'm in

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,239
Germany which I am all the time now good

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,330
too is never far from my mind because he

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,450
was this incredible aesthete and he was

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,490
amazing with language and he really

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,280
helped to capture the beauty in things

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,860
and the beauty in Scala is for me one of

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,470
the most compelling things about it it's

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,660
the thing that really grabbed me at the

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,550
start and so you know I've been kind of

00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,030
replaying in my head what's my history

00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,740
with Scala my first scala days was in

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,590
Switzerland when this volcano went off

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,120
and I I showed up with one change of

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,000
clothes and I was stuck in the country

00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,240
for ten days and it was basically a

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,940
total disaster but somewhat memorable

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,800
and somehow this is now kind of an

00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,690
easier experience since I live in Berlin

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,190
but it's really great to see so many

00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,520
people here this morning thank you for

00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,110
coming out giving a non-technical talk

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,880
at this conference is exciting because

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,920
some of the best technical docs I've

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,330
ever seen have been here so thank you so

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,120
what I'm going to talk about big picture

00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,460
is how what are the kind of conditions

00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,849
that we need to create in order for

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,280
Scala to really succeed I think you know

00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:13,980
a lot of us kind of watch closely to see

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,620
how is it doing and there was a recent

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,819
story about the TOB index and there's

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,379
been a bump

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,670
and that seems like good news and then

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,530
it's not clear is that because they

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,889
changed how the search works and all

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,810
this stuff and I feel a little bit

00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:31,290
qualified to talk about it because I've

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,790
introduced Scala in a few places so what

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,980
I'm going to talk about specifically is

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,319
first of all a little bit about systems

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,329
theory and then I want to talk about

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,430
something that I've never talked about

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:43,919
before called governance which is a word

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,299
that I have a hard time saying maybe you

00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,010
do too

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:49,469
and then finally this idea of

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,180
accountability there's a it's a pretty

00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,700
broad audience and it's gonna be hard to

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,329
connect with everyone but you know

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,889
fundamentally for scholars to succeed we

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,750
need to change our behavior a little bit

00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,719
and as developers we need to change how

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,519
we think about what goes on around

00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,260
developers and as leaders we need to

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,349
think of it a bit more about how we

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,900
structure and organize to succeed and to

00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:15,659
really allow good decisions to be made

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,949
and then at the end I'm going to ask a

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,840
little something of you so in some ways

00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,979
you know I feel like this Johnny

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,949
Appleseed of Scala I kind of got into it

00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,359
in a company and I snuck it in and then

00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:34,169
I took it to another company and then I

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:36,419
took it to a third company and today I

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,540
find myself at Zalando we're based here

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:40,799
in Berlin this is our 10th anniversary

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,299
it's been quite a success story for

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
those of you don't know it we're doing

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:45,930
four and a half billion euro in annual

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,930
revenue which I guess is kind of a lot

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,790
we handle about 90 million orders a year

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,099
we've 2,000 people working in tech and

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,049
over over 100 people working in Scala I

00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:00,989
actually found out last night it's hard

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,699
to figure out the exact number because

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,739
we have a culture of autonomy and

00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:06,000
encouraging autonomy and there's a lot

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,859
of things going on that we don't always

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,599
know but the approach that we took is

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:14,099
lando was quite different than what I

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:19,349
did in my previous company which was

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:21,989
Gilt Groupe there we made a huge

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:24,300
essentially wholesale change to embrace

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,340
Scala we more or less said overnight we

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,360
want the entire engineering team about a

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,059
hundred people to start doing this

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,889
we all kind of held hands and sang

00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,989
kumbaya together and said this is the

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,169
right thing to do and it was super hard

00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:42,229
and I'm not sure I would recommend that

00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,519
approach to be honest but it was you

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,599
know the parts that went well were

00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:51,979
really great and I wrote a ton of code

00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:53,509
in Scala at guilt guilt has was a I mean

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,829
they still sort of exist they were

00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:57,709
purchased but they were a flash sale

00:04:54,829 --> 00:05:00,829
site and every day at noon we saw about

00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:02,239
a 50x increase in traffic so we have

00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:05,239
these really kind of insane

00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:07,099
non-functional requirements and the

00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:12,049
programming part was pretty hard for

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:13,969
anything that faced customers when I

00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:17,289
started out with Scala I was at Tom Tom

00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:19,549
and Tom Tom was a pretty strict place I

00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,249
was sort of a little bit of a special

00:05:19,549 --> 00:05:25,639
employee and that my boss gave me a lot

00:05:22,249 --> 00:05:27,439
of latitude and I snuck Scala in kind of

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:31,909
against broke the rules

00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,559
I had we I had to write the service

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,629
really quickly and it was it's quite

00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:37,309
important for revenue and I wrote it in

00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:38,749
Scala and I deployed it and I didn't

00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:41,029
tell anybody that that's what I had done

00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,439
and the operations people came back to

00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,969
me and said this is the only thing

00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,159
that's ever been deployed that didn't

00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,869
have any reported bugs we want to know

00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,829
what you did differently and I was like

00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:50,829
oops

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:59,930
so I pushed it pretty hard and it tried

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,060
to take off I'm not quite sure how that

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,040
has worked out at one point I saw on the

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,440
same web page job ads for Scala

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,400
developers at TomTom guilt and zalando

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,020
and that made me feel pretty good like I

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,640
was somehow having a difference making a

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,020
difference but I think you know one of

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,060
the things that's become clear through

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,860
these different approaches is that we

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,190
really need to be thinking about what's

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,680
a sustainable way to get something like

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,260
Scala into a company it is controversial

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,820
it's one of many languages you know I'm

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,530
guessing most people here love it

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,480
some people definitely hate it I hear

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,740
from them from time to time but I think

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,600
I'd like to believe at least that we're

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,400
all here because they're we we all agree

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,040
there is something kind of special about

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,420
the whole language the ecosystem the

00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,970
culture while a little bit prickly

00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,250
sometimes is pretty high-performing and

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,320
there's some really great software now

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,320
in the world that's been built this way

00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:04,220
so I want to actually turn it over to

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:07,340
you now just for a minute and just ask

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,200
you why do you why I love Scala just

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,040
shout out a few things one word two

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:16,060
words what is it

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:20,690
assuming you love it since you're here

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:29,440
anybody freedom of choice simplicity

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:33,590
those are great sorry yeah less code

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,070
performance definitely immutability of

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:42,860
that area okay yeah those are I pretty

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:44,480
much agree with all of that for me

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,580
really all those things boil down to

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,840
something that's like beauty though for

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,140
me

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,150
simplicity less code it's just like when

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,120
when any of those things starts to kind

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:58,520
of resonate you just you get that I get

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,920
this feeling right that's like wow this

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,460
is actually really great

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,000
I wrote C++ for a long time I think I

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,890
wrote some

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,330
like half a million lines of C++ and

00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,040
then I wrote Java for a long time and

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:14,480
again something close to half a million

00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:16,790
lines of Java and my mantra was I lived

00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,960
like I type which is fast with a lot of

00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:23,690
mistakes it was like just producing code

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,800
was just all I did all day and it felt

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,020
great but after you know closing in on

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,270
two decades of that I was really

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,510
starting to lose this ability to

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,190
remember what in that was great I felt

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,760
like everything I did that felt clever

00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,370
was overcoming some problem not sort of

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:47,570
contributing to the net-net beauty of

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:49,460
things especially in Java when I

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,830
remembered you know I don't know who

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,350
does this some people I've heard carry

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,610
code from one job to the next that

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,410
they're really proud of and they maybe

00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,840
have a look at that from time to time

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,420
because of some problem that they solved

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:07,910
that was hard that they think they might

00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:10,100
need again just saying and and you know

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,740
the people I might have seen do that

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,660
you know it was always overcoming

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,250
something that just sucked fundamentally

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,780
there was no beauty in it it was like

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,450
this clever trick that was hard and

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,160
painful and it slowed down the important

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,400
things we figured out some stupid

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,750
incidental thing and with Scala it was

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,730
just kind of different it's like the

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,010
code that I wanted to carry with me was

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,080
beautiful I was proud of it you know I

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,450
was like wow it was correct by

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,380
inspection many times it was just a

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,820
totally different experience and you

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,570
know the world doesn't have to be that

00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:47,240
way but it can be that way and that's I

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,850
think the great privilege of why this is

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:55,280
important but I think you know there's a

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:57,980
few problems that I've seen now and you

00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,270
know I'm not about to say that when if

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,820
all you have is a hammer everything is

00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:03,950
nail it's a different point what I've

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:08,750
seen is that we actually are building a

00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:11,780
lot of hammers and we built we really

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,820
focus hard on tooling and that's somehow

00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,890
pleasurable and tooling is kind of

00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:19,279
interesting from my view because tooling

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:25,230
is very often very high symmetry

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:27,450
and Scala is also high symmetry I gave a

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,000
talk a few years ago Scala days in New

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,920
York on this very topic that this

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,990
sameness is kind of interesting and it

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,850
has it has an aesthetic but the things

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,110
that are really valuable in the world

00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,020
and the things that are truly beautiful

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:44,310
are actually not symmetric the Mona Lisa

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,630
is not symmetric and so there's a force

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,370
that tends to pull us into not

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,200
necessarily focusing on the real thing

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,800
so we're building a lot of hammers when

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,330
we should be building houses and this I

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,600
think is one of the great tricks that

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,920
we're trying to solve it zalando not

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,839
just through scala but how we really

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,600
organize and think about people and

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,240
process and how we build systems and how

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,870
we really try to delight our customers

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,620
and you know Scala is for me the best

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:18,080
hammer for a bunch of these problems

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:20,550
okay so that's kind of my introduction I

00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,630
wanted to talk about something that a

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,459
bunch of people lie about on their CVs

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:29,160
and I definitely I lied about this on my

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:31,589
CV for a long time and it was thing

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,660
called system theory so I put that I was

00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:36,120
like an expert in systems on my CV for

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:41,850
probably 15 years and I never actually

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,500
read a book on systems and then I you

00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,170
know went on kind of I like to read and

00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,640
I actually set up long term reading

00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,380
goals and this book popped up on my

00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,400
radar called the qingyan systems by

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,810
Donatella meadows and it's a it's kind

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,880
of an interesting book be in part

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,490
because she died before she finished it

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,950
and they published it any any how it is

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,380
that good and it's a really engaging

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,790
read and there's a lot of good stuff in

00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,020
it but for me basically there were four

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,660
points in that book that have more or

00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,160
less changed big parts of my life we've

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,010
changed how we think about systems how

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,450
we think about organizations and so I

00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,690
want to share those because I think they

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,730
really fit in nicely to how we need to

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:28,110
change how we think in order to really

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:30,480
succeed at pushing not just Scala to its

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,040
full potential but actually continuing

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,390
to preserve this amazing life

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,400
of what we get to do for money so

00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:42,150
basically there's these four things that

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,100
all systems have in common whether it's

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,290
systems in nature systems in your car

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,550
systems on the internet if they are

00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:52,620
successful they are resilient and it's

00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:56,130
essentially almost a universal law that

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,350
you know it a system that isn't a little

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,530
bit prepared for the unexpected will

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,350
become fragile and fail and actually be

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:09,450
a problem instead of kind of serving its

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,330
purpose the next two I've sort of

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:16,950
bundled into one video that I love

00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:18,870
hopefully is good successful systems are

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,810
always composed of self-organizing

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,600
autonomous autonomous agents and those

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:30,650
agents always form structures on demand

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:33,870
that really fit the purpose at hand and

00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,820
you know whether it is white blood cells

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,250
and how they organize to attack an

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,310
infection infection or even how a

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,650
successful company works you have to

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,380
compartmentalize things and then those

00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,110
things have to be able to not only be

00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,970
autonomous but really form larger

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,770
structures that can solve harder

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:59,480
problems and the fourth thing is that

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:02,310
they always have feedback loops and

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,670
somehow feedback loops are kind of like

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,230
uncomfortable for introverts and I guess

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,640
there's a lot of introverts in the room

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,770
I certainly am one but you know if

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,800
you're not doing something and getting

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,470
something back you're not really part of

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,120
a successful system whether you know

00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,340
you're creating some value for some

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,320
customer and trying to understand what

00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:27,510
that customer thinks or you're trying to

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,820
become a better programmer we're all

00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,550
better because someone better than us

00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,680
helped us out along the way and this

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,850
feedback even you know there are a lot

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,610
of ways to think about it but

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,430
fundamentally it is just this absolutely

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,440
essential part of a successful system

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,600
and it has to be there and anything that

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,810
we do that doesn't include some

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,990
notion of feedback is pretty likely to

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,660
fail and I'm highlighting these because

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,509
I found more and more that applying this

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,970
lens to different things you know is

00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,100
fruitful and that when things go well

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,930
very often you can sort of identify uh

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,779
yeah actually it has these attributes

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:12,389
and when they don't very often you can

00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:15,060
see that they're missing so with that in

00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:17,610
mind I'm gonna move on to something that

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:22,819
I thought I would never talk about in

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:25,620
public which is this idea of governance

00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:27,779
I've really struggled with this word for

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,910
the longest time I didn't really know

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,519
what it was I definitely knew that I

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,649
didn't like it as a concept and

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,699
basically it was like something that had

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:38,160
to be tolerated

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:43,290
somehow it was like maybe related to

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:46,079
continuing to getting paid just to give

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:50,730
some context this is me in 1993 I was

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,610
like the anti governance poster child I

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:57,060
was not I was not basically playing with

00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:00,000
the team at this point and subverting

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:02,310
everywhere I could but one of my

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,120
missions is is to get people a little

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,589
bit more comfortable with the idea you

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:13,139
know a world without governance is

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:14,850
totally insane and horrible and I don't

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:20,519
you know this is actually this reminds

00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:21,870
me of Bitcoin in some ways but you know

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,819
living in Berlin is it's kind of

00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,029
interesting because this is a very safe

00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:30,209
place things work the trains basically

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:32,579
operate it is you know pretty much a

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:34,949
democracy the rules of law work

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:36,660
governance here is working and it works

00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:38,519
in a way that makes this a great place

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,189
for people like me who don't really like

00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,810
governance to live it was not always

00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:47,310
like that in Berlin similarly you know

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,439
there's another spectrum that's maybe

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,600
look a place like Caracas where it's

00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:53,130
just you know you just wouldn't want to

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,260
live that way

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,490
[Music]

00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,620
but what I've sort of come to understand

00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,130
you know governance is a lot of things

00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,170
you know

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,330
is a written can be around compliance it

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:07,410
can be around security can be around

00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:10,140
architecture but in a way all governance

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,300
is about you know in in kind of the

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,220
day-to-day ways they matter is this

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,550
really enabling people to be more

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:21,209
introverted and actually focus on the

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,800
job at hand and it it it means they

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,350
don't have to talk to each other about

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,060
every single thing now it turns out

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:30,360
talking to each other is quite important

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:33,270
but you want to limit that to the things

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,070
that really matter so for example you

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,600
know with data governance can we have

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,470
this kind of realizations like data

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,730
governance is middleware right it's like

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,320
in a system that has some data

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,020
governance I can use your data without

00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,140
having to ask you what it means and if

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,740
you boil it down to its essence that's

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,260
all it is

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,690
and that's actually fantastic that

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,980
enables all this stuff it means that you

00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,630
know as you grow far far fewer

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,240
conversations redundant conversations

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,550
are necessary and it makes working life

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,100
better it makes it easier it makes it

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,110
faster and it makes customers happier

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,770
makes businesses more successful it's a

00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,330
good thing I spent half my life

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,620
rejecting this idea that's actually a

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:22,590
good thing if you do it right so if you

00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,150
take only one thing away I hope it's

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,340
that you become comfortable when people

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:29,390
talk about governance and there's people

00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,130
talking about stupid ways of governing

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,920
that is somehow endemic in our society

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,890
at the moment but you can be a force

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:45,300
because it really is trying to help us

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:51,090
in some way now part of governance is

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:54,390
around architecture and I spend a lot of

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,670
my life calling myself an architect and

00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:02,700
I did actually read books and I think I

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:04,110
was legitimately an architect and it is

00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,300
part of governance but it's a lot of

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,710
it's a lot of different things and you

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,940
know one of my favorite questions when I

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,830
interview someone who says they're an

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,160
architect is to get them to tell me what

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,320
architecture is

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,380
and there's a bunch of answers but

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,180
there's a few that I kind of like you

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,680
can tell architecture succeeds if you

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,830
don't have to tell somebody

00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:25,690
usually the business that ow oops you

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,490
know that's a great idea it's just that

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,010
that's super hard now because we did

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,710
this other stuff instead and that's what

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,570
we did doesn't connect up winning in

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,760
architecture is when someone has a great

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,220
idea and you say yeah actually that's

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,510
not so hard that we can fit that in

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,510
without breaking the paradigms

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:50,560
architecture is also about avoiding

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:53,680
these one-way doors you know there was

00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,720
this kind of period of time the early

00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,050
2000s when people discovered wow you can

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,720
evolve a database schema in production

00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:05,200
and this was huge actually at the time

00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,180
because you know in big companies in the

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,130
early 2000s and before there were whole

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,440
teams that would work for months on

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,960
these incredible database schemas that

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,030
were so complicated and then once they

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,610
were put in it's like you were living

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,770
with that for the next decade and that

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,800
was genuinely a stupid way to build

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:25,450
software and super painful and then we

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,760
figured out actually you know we can

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,680
save those decisions for later we don't

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,590
have to go through this one-way door and

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,980
for me this was a you know an

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:38,500
under-recognized triumph of architecture

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,990
but getting you know getting these

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,390
things right where you don't even know

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:48,130
sometimes if they're right for years is

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:51,400
incredibly important now some of you may

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:55,090
have seen this choose boring technology

00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,670
thing meme this went around inside the

00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,690
land oh and it generated some

00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,150
conversation because we are not choosing

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,460
boring technology as a rule at least

00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,590
we're not limiting ourselves to boring

00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,420
technology I would say we have a very

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,490
healthy approach to when boring makes

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,830
sense and when it doesn't and the guy

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,650
who wrote this is super smart is one of

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:21,490
the people behind that see they did

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:23,710
amazing stuff with PHP and you know when

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,990
I read this it's like okay just this

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,700
makes sense and I sort of

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,020
but I don't like it spiritually and I

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,030
can't figure out why and you know it's

00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,429
like if it's somehow pieced together why

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:36,870
don't I like this why is this wrong or

00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:41,200
maybe is it wrong is it maybe it's right

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,730
and I think you know many of us work for

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,980
companies those companies have to be

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,490
profitable otherwise they cannot succeed

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:52,480
and in some sense it has to be our

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:55,900
mission to get them and keep them

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,260
profitable but that doesn't mean that we

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,510
have to only do that and not only that

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:06,820
only doing that is somehow a very

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:09,429
short-term view we also want to create a

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,280
sustainable enterprise where people

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:15,340
where great people want to come we want

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,280
to succeeding especially you know in the

00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,110
in the very modern era means innovating

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,240
constantly on behalf of your customers

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,650
you know if you don't innovate someone

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,440
else will and steal them

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,250
we all have to be innovating and so if

00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:32,260
we take this okay what's the most like

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:35,740
let's call it you know Soviet approach

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,690
to building the simplest lowest tech

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,570
version of every single thing that we do

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,390
yeah that can work but it's not very

00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:45,670
inspiring there are a lot of people who

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,320
are inspired by the business part and

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,240
that that's important there have to be

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,010
those people but there also have to be

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,890
people who are inspired by the beauty of

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:57,450
solving these problems because we're out

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,800
there and we're gonna work somewhere and

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,920
ideally we're gonna work somewhere that

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,410
can find this right balance of how do we

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:08,290
actually keep the aesthetics in mind how

00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,940
do we keep this idea that's like yeah it

00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,940
is important to be profitable but it's

00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,020
also important to have style and taste

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,880
there's so many different ways that we

00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,610
could do it in so many ways that is

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,800
being done you know

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,980
let's find the one that feels good too

00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:30,700
and if all we do is like what's the

00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:32,710
boring most stupid way not stupid it's

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,380
just you know I don't know I find it a

00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,270
little bit soulless and my god if you

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,740
know if nothing else Scala has some soul

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,740
that's why it's still here

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:45,070
so I thought I'd talk a little bit about

00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,029
how we've been able to do that at

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:53,349
zalando because I'm pretty proud of this

00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:56,799
in in 2015 we made a big change and and

00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:58,359
in particular we changed how how we sort

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,009
of thought at a very high level about

00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:01,839
how to architect systems we introduced

00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:04,059
some architectural principles and

00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:05,619
there's two of them in particular that

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,389
have turned out to be really really

00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,909
helpful in making sure that we have an

00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:13,899
ecosystem where we can keep trying new

00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:15,700
technology and you know do we want to

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:20,619
keep trying to new technology forever

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:22,929
kind of yes but at the same time it is

00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:25,210
you know there's a natural kind of 8020

00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,339
rule that starts to settle down and

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:30,909
there's a few things that really really

00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:33,940
work and you know in the past that was

00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,950
Java for us and more and more over the

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,339
past three years that's been Scala also

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:43,029
Postgres but the first things is this

00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:44,919
API first concept this is something I

00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:46,659
pushed several companies in a row and

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,109
never stuck anywhere until the land oh

00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,359
it is a completely sort of obvious idea

00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:54,849
from a good software engineering

00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:56,979
practices point of view but it was

00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:59,200
incredibly exhilarating to see this

00:24:56,979 --> 00:25:03,969
actually take hold and to really

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,469
understand what it enables you know more

00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:08,440
companies are doing this now there's

00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:10,239
pretty good tooling around it but

00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,029
somehow this you know this architectural

00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:16,450
decision of separating implementation

00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:18,099
from interface and really treating

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,080
interface development as a first-class

00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:22,089
activity is probably the highest

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,849
leverage thing I've ever seen any

00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:29,830
company do in terms of really enabling

00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:33,849
scale and diversity without compromise

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,979
and you know we've written a lot about

00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,529
it on our tech blog we've open-sourced a

00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:40,029
lot of tooling around it if you are if

00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:44,919
you're if you're building kind of a

00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:47,379
service based environment I could not

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:50,229
recommend more strongly that you look at

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,600
this approach there are a few different

00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:54,520
variants for how to do it there's no

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,860
standardization on what's the right kind

00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,440
of meta language for this but in terms

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,770
of really changing people's behavior it

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,260
it just simply works and your customers

00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,390
will appreciate having this kind of

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,820
uniformity and well-thought-through ness

00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,030
to api's people have been saying for 10

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:16,180
or 15 years api's are huge they really

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:18,460
are huge now finally and so if you're

00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,310
not doing this you should in part

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,070
because it makes it possible to give

00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:28,480
teams more autonomy around what tools

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:33,090
they use it doesn't really matter what's

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:35,710
behind the API if the API is is agnostic

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,280
around the technology if people want to

00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,660
use Scala

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,290
they can just got a live thing when use

00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:43,210
Haskell they can use Haskell it is

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,040
somehow you know compared to how we did

00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,170
things for a long time which was lots of

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,600
shared libraries and increasing kind of

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:53,260
binary coupling over time this is a huge

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:55,150
deal and the other I'm embarrassed to

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:57,990
put up here in 2018 because my god

00:26:55,150 --> 00:27:00,730
aren't are we not sick of this topic yet

00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,490
but micro-services is also a super key

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,760
part of this part of taking risks around

00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,980
technology is part it goes in hand with

00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,050
trying to keep things small so when you

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,620
make a mistake you can actually fix that

00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:16,450
mistake you know there's a ton of good

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:20,740
reasons to use micro services this is

00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:23,590
not that talk and it is a little bit

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,390
overhyped but it's overhyped because it

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:29,170
is a really good idea for a bunch of

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:31,540
different reasons and one of those is

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:34,810
that it lets you keep evolving your tech

00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,240
stack and however great whatever tools

00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,100
you are using now in five or ten years

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,680
it's not going to be that easy to hire

00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,920
super great people who know how to do

00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,720
that or want to do that and so you need

00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,880
to build this flexibility in and that's

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,070
one of the great advantages of using

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,350
micro services especially with API first

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,900
that people don't really talk about it

00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:00,360
it makes the technology choice less

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:04,450
critical and that is important

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:07,920
hinging too much on on a technology bet

00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,920
is a bad long term

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,760
so we made these we put these kind of

00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,920
like architectural cornerstones in place

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,110
and stood back to see what was what

00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,510
would happen and we turned to horror

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,550
stories about some other companies one

00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,740
of them in Berlin going a little bit

00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:27,590
overboard on the let's use every single

00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,890
hacker news recommended technology that

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,020
we can think of and so we needed some

00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:36,200
way to introduce some notion of

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,560
governance and so we adopted the thought

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,140
works

00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,150
TechRadar approach and we open sourced

00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,490
it and it's actually generated a lot of

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:45,980
interest externally maybe you've seen it

00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,230
if you go we have a boost set up I think

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:51,500
there's even the tech radar set up there

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,390
you can have a look that works very

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,940
smart I think what we've done is also

00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:58,070
quite smart it's I mean mostly stealing

00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,870
from them but really adopting to how do

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:02,270
you make these kind of Technology

00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:05,420
decisions in a company in the same way

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,760
and how do you decide is this the right

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:13,720
moment you know to do this in Erlang or

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,470
not or you know how do we avoid

00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,410
unintentionally having the entire

00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:20,780
company run down a wrong path so there

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,850
you know it is at the end of the day a

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,920
set of recommendations that it would be

00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:27,170
local to accompany around this is this

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,760
is a technology that we have a lot of

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,070
expertise in-house in this is a

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,720
technology that we don't and here's some

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,930
guidelines about how we want to

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,940
introduce new technologies in for

00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:41,780
example is Landa we prefer just one team

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:45,380
to do it first and report back not have

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:48,530
like a bunch of teams all say deciding

00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,780
it was a mistake this is a light-weight

00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:53,450
form of governance that is very high

00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,180
leverage and I think you know the amount

00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:58,220
of interest we get through having open

00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,960
source indicates to me that it's really

00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,170
quite interesting so I would recommend

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,790
that you have a look because you know

00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,500
unless you were in a working for a

00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,670
company that has just fully drunk the

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:11,600
Scala kool-aid in which case

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:13,520
congratulations have fun as you get

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,930
bigger that just you know gets harder

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,170
it's not the perfect tool for every

00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:21,150
problem but having a culture where

00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,190
reasonable decisions can be made through

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,290
a consensus process about where we want

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,800
to go and where we don't and especially

00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:31,320
how to take risks is a key part of what

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:38,670
makes a company a great place to be for

00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:45,420
people like us okay the third thing I

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:47,460
want to talk about is autonomy in 2015

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,770
we rolled out this big event called

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,340
radical agility where we really pivoted

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:55,560
the entire tech work of zalando away

00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,380
from a very command and control very

00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,500
structured and kind of unfulfilling

00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,840
place to be - one that we could really

00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,050
scale and where we could continue

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,150
continue to attract great people and you

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:11,480
know we set off on this kind of big

00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:15,600
adventure to figure out how to do that

00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:19,740
we embrace these three ideas popularized

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,990
by Dan pink around how to really keep

00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,990
people engaged and how to basically

00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:28,590
motivate smart people and the first of

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:33,510
those is really try to get down to the

00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:35,790
purpose of things we to be honest our

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,500
success in the early days was based on

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,330
one person who was very good at saying

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,840
you do this you do this you do this you

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,730
do this you do this you do this and all

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,520
of those this's were pretty smart at the

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,310
time but there wasn't a lot of

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,700
creativity for the people on the

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,930
receiving end of those instructions and

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,300
you know as things get more complicated

00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:59,880
no one person is smart enough to do that

00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,520
consistently it just doesn't scale it

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,500
also kind of sucks I think all the

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,860
people who were there or at least the

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,100
ones that I know have some form of PTSD

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,490
from that experience a minor form but it

00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,480
was you know it was pretty real and

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,670
what's interesting about giving people

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,670
purpose is that it can unleash

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:23,490
creativity in them and that's really

00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:26,490
this is also connected to this Simon

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:28,140
scenic concept of start with why but

00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,390
really you know it's like we don't know

00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,160
it for the same reason that waterfall

00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,700
planning is kind of stupid we just don't

00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,710
know

00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,370
at the start what we're gonna know and

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:39,930
so if people have in mind either that

00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,580
they know why they're doing it or at

00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:44,220
least if they don't know why they should

00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:47,460
ask it's somehow kind of a secret to

00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:52,980
scaling a secret for really making work

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,780
more fulfilling for everybody and you

00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,350
know it turns it into problem-solving

00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,940
rather than just doing tasks and also

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,720
sort of Foster's ascend and ownership

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,820
concept the second big principle from

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,730
dan pink is around autonomy and the you

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,020
know this is pretty well known at this

00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:14,010
point a lot of people have talked about

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,690
autonomous teams people even regularly

00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,250
try to hire me because they have set up

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:21,840
autonomous teams and it's gone terribly

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:23,520
wrong but you know there's basically

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,200
everybody likes the idea of I can make

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,270
these decisions and live with the

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,370
outcome and then people who actually run

00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:31,440
businesses love the idea of unleashing

00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,540
the parallelism of autonomous teams it

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,880
somehow just feels great for everybody

00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,500
feels like we can get more done it's

00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,350
just super hard to actually do in

00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,650
practice and then the third damn pink

00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,950
ISM is around mastery so you know we're

00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:48,120
all learning all the time learning

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,180
happens through books and it happens

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,600
through actually doing and making

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,070
mistakes one of my favorite lines around

00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,960
this is that good judgment comes from

00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,570
experience and experience comes from

00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,390
poor judgment you got to set it up so

00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,430
people can screw up and that affects how

00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,860
you build systems and it affects how you

00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:10,170
do your culture and it also affects how

00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,210
you kind of give people just the time

00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,120
and space to learn something new on a

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:18,420
regular basis you know and if you don't

00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,060
especially with introverts as people

00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,490
become an increasingly bigger fish in an

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:24,840
increasingly smaller pond they actually

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:27,420
become less confident about their

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,430
abilities you spend a decade being an

00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,260
iOS developer you might start to think

00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:34,230
that's the only developer that you could

00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,630
ever be and in fact that's probably not

00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:38,550
true and so having this kind of mindset

00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:42,120
if we really want people to learn new

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:44,129
things really does genuinely make them

00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,230
better

00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:50,859
but oh my god there's a dark side to all

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:55,000
of this and it's especially around

00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:58,000
autonomy so when we rolled out autonomy

00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,470
we basically said okay we all believe

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,099
very strongly it was another kind of

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:05,619
kumbaya moment that these are how we

00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:07,299
want to run this kind of org but we have

00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:09,670
no idea really how to lead it yet

00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:13,660
but we're just gonna like jump in and

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:16,059
figure it out as we go and so we we

00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:18,339
granted teams all of this autonomy right

00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:20,020
from the start and I mean it wasn't

00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:22,210
totally stupid we wanted to get away

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,549
from a very regimented way of building

00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,950
software we had a very strict tool set

00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:28,900
we wanted to start you know the people

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,700
who are working at home using some other

00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,369
language we would rather say that they

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,890
use that language at work rather than go

00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,930
find a job somewhere else so it felt

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,420
like this amazing moment of empowerment

00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:43,630
but what we got was a little bit more

00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:45,760
Lord of the Flies in some cases it was a

00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,160
spectrum or a bell curve as I like to

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,450
say but it was somehow not knowing how

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,180
to lead this stuff was pretty tricky and

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,160
we had essentially made one huge glaring

00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:02,109
fundamental error and how we did this

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:09,640
and it's that we treated autonomy as a

00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:12,970
gift instead of a reward autonomy is not

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,619
a reasonable input to a team you can't

00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:17,710
just say here you go you're we're

00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:20,109
injecting you with autonomy they have to

00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,029
learn it and they have to earn it and

00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:25,180
it's a spectrum and some teams are

00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:26,589
amazing at it and some teams are not and

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,539
part of what leaders have to do is

00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:30,670
understand the context in the situation

00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:33,220
and do the right thing

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,809
and you know we saw some really great

00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,579
stuff we saw some really depressing

00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:42,579
stuff it was the full spectrum of

00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:44,500
outcomes but pretty early we figured out

00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:47,020
that we had maybe made a little bit of a

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:50,170
mistake and it took some time to fix it

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:52,150
and for me you know it's pretty far on

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:54,810
this journey when I saw this tweet about

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,880
a year ago from Kent Beck

00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,540
which I absolutely love it is such a

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,460
succinct way to put it and what we had

00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,810
missed was that basically accountability

00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,070
is like the mathematical dual of

00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:10,410
autonomy you cannot reasonably reason

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:14,900
about autonomy if you don't have some

00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:14,900
kind of accountability system in place

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,210
and you know at the end of the day

00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,090
accountability it means that you have to

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,220
own the and that was missing

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:28,080
somehow in this now the thing about

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,830
accountability is it's actually another

00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:34,500
word I for a long time hated to say like

00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,390
governance it just it was a little hard

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,280
to get it off my tongue I wasn't quite

00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,810
sure why and went against some kind of

00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:45,330
rebel DNA in me and I always associated

00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:46,760
it with accounting which is not really

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,900
something I'm good at

00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,660
and it just seemed like it was all about

00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,430
the money and I've really you know it's

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,330
like I I like to have a healthy respect

00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:59,940
for the money part but it can't be the

00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:03,030
driving thing if you want to lead a rich

00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:05,010
and fulfilling life but through this

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,770
process it's like okay you know we need

00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:09,090
to understand what this is we had a very

00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,590
uncomfortable moment when I realized

00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,390
that none of us actually knew what's the

00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:15,570
difference between responsibility and

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:17,250
accountability and that was pretty

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,200
embarrassing because we certainly should

00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,640
have known case you don't know

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,220
responsibility can be shared

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,360
accountability cannot accountability

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,630
really does come down to an individual

00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,790
but we've what we try to do is

00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:35,370
understand accountability in a way that

00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:41,220
makes sense for people who do what we do

00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:42,600
I think there's three key parts the

00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,120
first part of accountability is you have

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,340
to be committed to what you're doing if

00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,900
you're not actually committed like

00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,350
running around in a horse mask in a

00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,390
hurricane

00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,900
that's pretty committed maybe not

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:57,390
healthy but if you are not enthusiastic

00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,180
about what you're doing if you haven't

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,770
found a way over this kind of mental

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,160
hump even if it's something kind of

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,310
boring

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,460
then you're not committed

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:11,980
my very first job I had a boss who

00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:13,600
worked on the Amiga and I was just like

00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,660
oh my god that's the coolest thing ever

00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,940
and tell me all about it and then I said

00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,370
what did you work on after that and he

00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,710
said he worked on medical record

00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,500
document processing applications and

00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:29,350
they kind of like my face fell and I

00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,940
lost interest in the conversation and he

00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,470
you know he gave me this look that I'll

00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,210
never forget or he's like what you

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,850
haven't figured out yet is that you can

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:40,000
make any technical challenge interesting

00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,770
if you look at it in the right way and

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,530
that for me was definitely a growing

00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,330
moment it took some time to for that to

00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:48,370
sink in but this was related to

00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:52,000
commitment and it's related to what it

00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:54,430
means to be mature as a professional to

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,320
actually be able to say okay this is

00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,970
important to somebody there's a customer

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,460
here that matters and I'm going to be

00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,830
committed and even excited about this

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,630
and I'm gonna maybe it's easy maybe it's

00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,460
hard but at the end of the day there

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:10,050
might be a choice and that's part of

00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,050
what being accountable means

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:17,860
transparency is also a necessary

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,300
ingredient to being accountable so this

00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,490
is like the the accountability that's

00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,280
not accounting but it's like give the

00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:26,980
account what's the story what are you

00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,100
doing what are your plans what are your

00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:33,190
goals what is your progress if you are

00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,610
not part of some system where that's

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:38,500
discussed you're not really accountable

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:39,730
but I used to hate that stuff I mean I

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,800
used to joke that there was a yahoo

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:45,400
group for project managers who had to

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,130
work with me it was so hard to get to

00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,130
get nailed down on any of this stuff and

00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,800
I look back I wasted so much time by

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,450
just typing instead of actually trying

00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,340
to think a little bit higher what do we

00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,500
want to achieve here how are we gonna

00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,810
know when we're done and how can we be

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,520
part of a bigger system yes the

00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:08,740
reprogram errs can change the world but

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,880
not as fast as 3000 and so this

00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:15,520
transparency is absolutely essential and

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,530
related to that this idea of being open

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,840
to evaluation

00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:22,930
what was the outcome what were the

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,480
consequences what did we learn how does

00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:28,420
this contribute to our mastery and this

00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:33,730
is the feedback loop that's so key

00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:37,990
because no one ever got better at

00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:39,730
anything without feedback that's why

00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,680
people talk about feedback cultures and

00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,510
all this stuff you know you can maybe

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,960
get a little bit better but nobody ever

00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:49,150
actually got great there has to be this

00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,190
honesty about this is what happened this

00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:53,320
is what we learned this is what we're

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:58,120
doing and this is the final piece of

00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:01,510
this system that can drive autonomy into

00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:04,420
a working state if you can be trusted

00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:06,750
because you can actually be honest about

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,500
what you're doing and how it's going and

00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:12,120
demonstrate over time that your

00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:14,200
decisions make sense it's it's just like

00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,120
thermodynamics you will be trusted

00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,620
people don't have the energy to pay

00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,690
attention to the things where they know

00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,040
what the answer is going to be

00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,980
everything here is fine there are

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,010
challenges we're overcoming them and

00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:31,810
that's where autonomy comes from that's

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:34,450
how you get it now one of the things

00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,190
that makes this super hard is that you

00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:38,320
know there's a million things that can

00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:42,660
cause us to fail there's so many

00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:48,280
dependencies things outside our control

00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:49,750
and it's very often structural and this

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,230
is another place where system theory

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:55,690
comes in because you know you bill like

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:58,690
you know I'm not really a fan of Halak

00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:03,190
recei because I think hierarchies are

00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:05,350
very useful data structure there are

00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,060
hard decisions that have to be made the

00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,250
conversations of involving lots of

00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,110
people never resolved hierarchies are

00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,640
useful if for no other reason that you

00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,710
can reduce the number of people in the

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,950
conversation and make a decision that

00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:19,690
that group is accountable for but what

00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:22,240
happens is it's kind of nice to be at

00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,940
the top of a hierarchy and the hierarchy

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,450
starts to just serve the existence of

00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:30,340
the hierarchy and so what we learned

00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,090
from system theory is that for all of

00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,430
this to work

00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:35,740
we have to take a very flexible view of

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:39,010
what the structure actually is to

00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:42,760
succeed that means pulling people

00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:45,520
together into you know heterogeneous

00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,730
groups that can solve problems and end

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,910
so that they have less to blame fewer

00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,740
things outside their domain of control

00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:57,670
something's stopping you own it pull it

00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:59,200
in don't fall victim to Conway's law now

00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,450
for many of you it's not really within

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,870
your power to just say okay we're gonna

00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:06,820
change the whole structure of this thing

00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:09,100
but you can be part of the thinking

00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,740
behind that you can push for that and

00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:20,550
you can start to take ownership you can

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:24,490
start to adapt so you have to own it and

00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:26,950
somehow the the one thing that seems to

00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:30,040
start people on this journey is to go

00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:32,170
through this process of owning what is

00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,690
the thing that can cause me to fail what

00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,970
is the one thing outside my domain of

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:41,140
control right now which I could blame

00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:44,650
failure on so I'd like to ask you to

00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:51,280
take out your phone pretty sure most of

00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:52,630
you have a phone open up Twitter if you

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,040
say you don't have Twitter I don't

00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:59,280
believe you and I want you to think for

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,690
a minute about one thing

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,240
that you currently don't have any

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:09,160
control over that could cause you to

00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:14,620
fail and I want you to tweet that with

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:17,800
the hashtag own the and that

00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:20,290
somehow is some tiny little force to

00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,790
start to pull the world around you into

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,700
shape where you can start to take

00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,810
accountability and when you put all of

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,480
this stuff together

00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,880
not only can you love the tools that you

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,840
work with and love the people that you

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,090
work with but you can also succeed at

00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,680
what you're doing pull the stuff

00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:45,819
together and own it

00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:47,250
I'll wait did you tweet do you need

00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:49,480
another minute

00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,339
so I have to say my favorite part of

00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,890
this is going and reading the tweets so

00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:59,440
I've stood up here for an hour I deserve

00:45:53,890 --> 00:46:03,400
some tweets okay so let me leave you

00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,770
with this you know

00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:10,390
also good to set about love that it

00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:13,210
doesn't dominate it cultivates and so

00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:16,390
for Scala to continue to cultivate in a

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,549
highly competitive world where you know

00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:21,329
there are a lot of good ideas a lot of

00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:23,319
competing technologies and a lot of

00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:28,329
misunderstanding about what's actually

00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:30,490
important we have to understand how it

00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:32,650
fits into systems and what are the

00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,420
systems that we need that can build this

00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:38,200
kind of meritocracy so that it can

00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,910
emerge on its own merits we have to have

00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,790
the governance systems in place that can

00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:44,680
really support and drive people making

00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:49,059
the right decisions not on behalf of

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:51,430
everyone but on behalf of their and

00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:53,020
then we have to be accountable for the

00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,030
decisions that we make and what we build

00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:59,260
and what is the outcome of those

00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:01,900
decisions and we can't be held back by

00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:05,950
what somebody else is letting us down we

00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:14,310
got to own the Thanks

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:14,310
