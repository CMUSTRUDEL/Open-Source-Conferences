Title: Pacific Northwest Scala 2013 Inlining anonymous functions with macros by Erik Osheim

Description: 
	The inlining problem (described by Cliff Click) is something that affects all functional languages on the JVM. The basic idea is that tight-loops dispatching to an anonymous function can defeat all of the JVMs optimization strategies. This creates a natural tension between writing the most concise code possible (DRY) and "manually inlining" boilerplate code for performance reasons.

Macros give us one possible tool to solve this problem. This talk describes a strategy where we can use anonymous function literals to generate implementations at compile-time. This strategy has the potential to give us terse, high-level source code that compiles to fast bytecode. In this talk, we'll see some early efforts, as well as challenges.
