Title: Pacific Northwest Scala 2013 Functional Raster Image Processing in Scala by Stephen Judkins
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Pacific Northwest Scala 2013
Description: 
	Most existing image processing libraries feature clumsy imperative interfaces to complicated mutable data structures. Here, we will show how raster graphics can be represented using simple functions and data structures and how a new library helps bridge the gap to real-world image formats. We'll see how operations on raster graphics can be made simpler, faster, more memory-efficient, and more composable compared to existing alternatives. We'll see both how common image processing tasks can be simple expressed, and examples of visually striking or fun effects that this framework makes easy.
