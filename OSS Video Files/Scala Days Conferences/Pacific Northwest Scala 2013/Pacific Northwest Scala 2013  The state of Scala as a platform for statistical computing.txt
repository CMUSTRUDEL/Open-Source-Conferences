	                              so bitterly diverse kind of group talks                               today a lot focusing on my kind of the                               data space just kind of a few archetypes                               of tech talks in library top of                               incidences something else maybe we'll                               say it's an opinionated survey and maybe                               something of an intervention I hope to                               have a little bit more let's say any                               code to release with this little habit                                so instead of the release of libraries                                infinity that announcement of some kind                                of program to come stop yeah great talks                                office today so the theme is really                                going to be Scala as an environment for                                statistical programming both to fade                                perhaps this is it's really possible and                                also to kind of inquire into how good                                how much is able to compete with things                                that are and Python so a little bit                                about me I do live in New York right now                                but I went to school here in Portland                                that worked here for a while i study                                mathematics in CS so I kind of shadow                                line to doing a lot of functional                                programming in kind of a formal                                verification on one hand you know data                                science this first sort of thing that                                know what it is and so yeah that's good                                work and he's started working on a most                                intimate aren't item that assigns it                                showing our kind of big citation network                                analysis of the US patents did some                                stuff in Perl doing the new                                and then worked in Scala here cortland                                do kind of medical fraud and                                visualization so so worked in a lot of                                these different kind of thumb the                                assigns for most of my career it's                                working this kind of hodgepodge of                                languages and yet it's mostly guard                                Python to begin with visually the                                scholar it kind of was really hoping                                that if I'm sorry I'm unified this                                really nice modern language into                                potentially to some some serious                                analytics and so those are the soulless                                language and one of the first things I                                wanted to do was just kind of                                reimplement a simple data munging kind                                of job that I did in Python and I've                                just just horrified at how it turned out                                with this memory usage was three or four                                times more I mean just figuring out how                                to parse a file was just I mean awful                                right i mean we have this source thing                                that it represents source files i mean                                it's just obvious that it's not what the                                language designed there were these point                                this kind of group scripting tasks or                                something and i'm not really i am not                                talking a job of a background so all                                this kind of job files felt at the time                                was just horrible it's okay then we have                                this data may be in a nice case class we                                had it in Scala and what we're going to                                do with it right I mean there's not much                                at all it's scholar at the time and then                                you have this weekend thing which is                                really about if elegant its namesake                                that's a pika                                nice creature of things all the things                                that people were talking about today                                right i mean is this the boxing numeric                                types of scholars in java or it's crazy                                we have non-commutative edition on                                numeric types right saying what can we                                do log on who knows how we do love is                                different in America types and this is                                just not a nice way to do the excitons                                right so I kind of had idea the retreat                                right I love scala for this kind of core                                web and systems development which didn't                                have what it took for this kind of                                general or flow of data analytics so it                                stuck to kind of doing this data munging                                in Python and analytics and depletion in                                our so it's kind of polyglot of your                                workflow which you know it has its up in                                straight minutes so I'm talking about                                this workflow I'm sure this will be                                pretty familiar what is it right and                                it's what especially is there to                                emphasize that i am talking about like                                data science which is to say that not                                someone who has a degree in like a                                particular domain of data open one                                rahoon this kind of experimental that is                                really important right link for working                                in areas where you might not have very                                 many kind of operatories sometimes about                                 how it's structured and so really kind                                 of playing with this important and so                                 first you know what kind of munching                                 this data may be from a variety of api's                                 csv files firing protocols xml files you                                 may be were lucky you have some really                                 nice process database we're going to do                                 a lot of exploration right we're going                                 to be kind of sorting filter                                 latest data set doing some kind of                                 rudimentary statistical analyses                                 visualizations and then sometime we'll                                 have a problem that maybe we understand                                 I will be able to build a model for it                                 on some structured data that hopefully                                 we can kind of bind as lightly as                                 possible and we really understand what's                                 going on whatever you mean and then                                 somehow production happens it's great                                 right so in short what you need for this                                 right we need an interactive environment                                 most code reuse waving you don't want                                 this kind of repo where things get lost                                 you want to be able to patty code that                                 you've developed in this experiment away                                 yeah really good data structure for                                 exploring subset and transforming                                 heading oh geez we typed collinar data                                 I'll go to this bit more weeks maybe the                                 least obvious these points more                                 debatable you need sensible numeric                                 abstractions you can write just generic                                 code on numbers with sensible trade-offs                                 between precision and once you get                                 access to a decent library for easily in                                 variously visualizing this data                                 structure that we just need acid into                                 statistical library well tested in                                 performing methods of models this is                                 just what you need as well as point                                    just been will harpoons a little bit                                 I think you're this spreadsheet with the                                 frame is just this fundamental way that                                 we have our mount work whether is this                                 kind of row types or kind of relational                                 algebra this is just what we have it's                                 important to distinguish it from the                                 matrix right pieces it's not just                                 numeric data it's fundamentally energy                                 asleep titleist exploratory phase when                                 cat Oracle variables dates what a                                 arbitrary string your nose dive in                                 dentistry and either some establishes is                                 kind of historically contingent based on                                 the kind of prevalence of excel but it                                 is really natural for school for work                                 and it's especially great movement wants                                 the composability of one statistical                                 libraries want to be able to change                                 together statistical transformations and                                 then pipe in communication at the end                                 right this is kind of generic we have                                 any good exploration so how the wicked                                 was probably done the most work but                                 really on these it's the whole kind of                                 environment phase matching together kind                                 of our models organization as a nice                                 paper out recently called a tiny detail                                 and he has this I think is a really                                 maybe obvious for this it's a kind of                                 important point a Titan dataset it's                                 easy to manipulate model and visualize                                 and has a very specific structure                                 variables are stored in columns                                 observations and rose and a single type                                 of experimental system courteous and I                                 think really us the environment of                                 computing just kind of have to support                                 this or it ends up just so okay                                 obviously these are like some pretty                                 basic criteria that are met but just an                                 ever-increasing number of languages and                                 frameworks right I mean for any language                                 of there exists at least one book up                                 before expert data why write the kanji                                 science it analysis the ax sorcery you                                 know we have all these libraries and                                 even new languages develop just tackle                                 like this core work so I think it's                                 important here that we kind of really                                 work to be able to assess languages                                 along this kind of really dangerous                                 border between the objective would say                                 what tools exist I'm sure they are                                 history hair and corrections in it and                                 this kind of like subjective criteria of                                 just what is it like to work with this                                 really drunk to kind of straddle this                                 line because I mean we have this real                                 problem of how I'm going to choose                                 between these that isn't just based on                                 the existence of some kind of like                                 is that we're stuck with right so this                                 is a really hard problem here gives nice                                 jexster quotes here but is it's just                                 this basic point that you know in                                 computer science and mathematics                                 notational conventions are just crucial                                 right you are achievements depend                                 critically on the availability of this                                 and whereas your mathematicians can kind                                 of say there's formalism natural                                 language and assuming some kind of level                                 meaning that pre-exists we as computer                                 scientists are one hundred percent stuck                                 in the program text with all the                                 idiosyncrasies of the api's all these                                 inconsistencies this is all we have it's                                 really hard to say anything sensible                                 whatsoever about this right in and                                 checks are between the dramatic view                                 writings its final hope for dies you'll                                 just understand you know one formal                                 notation why it's good wine other she's                                 a pain in the back right and he didn't                                 really make it there right computer                                 science is still in like ninety-nine                                 percent cardosa like scarred occult                                 stuff right least we don't have it yet                                 so I'm working on this and so so kind of                                 opposing or something like once a                                 phenomenology of the data scientist                                 really need to work with these kind of                                 tools environments to assess the kind of                                 experience or providing for people and I                                 think we're we're going to do this with                                 API is the languages that seem to get                                 more assessed based on                                 feature sets really what it's like to                                 kind of be in a degree of this and often                                 I guess it is because we are stuck with                                 the language depending on some kind of                                 each domain that we're in or like scope                                 base but I also think it's it's much                                 more important because language is                                 informal are much more mediums than                                 tools right and i think is especially                                 important in this this realm of data                                 science because you know whereas I don't                                 need Twitter to talk to my friend or                                 something or Instagram pictures of them                                 we really don't have any way to work                                 with data but computers right and we see                                 this you know Excel is this hugely                                 important to suffer that to change the                                 world due to its efficiencies right when                                 we have this unfortunate control highly                                 mutable completely unsafe but you're                                 beautiful and perfect we know on the way                                 that I don't know it's insane it is this                                 important product I think of it the ways                                 computer scientist and oh it of China                                 bed and so I was inspired after after                                 Paul's talk to putting the slightest                                 thinking spinny corollaries women to my                                 language mum is my world but also the                                 world of the happy is quite difficult                                 unhappy and I cannot bend happening to                                 the world to my will like including                                 powers so everyone understood the                                 difference between though the happy                                 world of the data scientist in the world                                 in a way that is languages and                                 environments kind of constrain us okay                                 so mr. stuff wasn't criteria and I think                                 this is not that these criteria we're                                 kind of stumbled that deputy basic                                 article trying to stralis line but it's                                 hard these are not category with the                                 names extra but                                 I think this is the start of these                                 things that we can think about there are                                 relatively concrete right you want to                                 talk about predictable and concise you                                 guys the consistency of data structure                                 inputs and outputs since you are                                 libraries how easy it is to reason about                                 its performance correctness and just                                 network services so today I'm working                                 all the time we won't talk these other                                 tools what kind folks in our Python in                                 these main libraries and scallop and                                 whether or not they can really serve                                 along as criteria that environment for                                 doing statistical computing so Python                                 you're working you're like we have this                                 obviously dynamic language with the next                                 people my workflow yeah I python is                                 concrete webtoons we handed as he                                 provides a nice frame structure myla                                 simply saying the American types with                                 pretty good performance if you come by                                 visualization is per week and we do have                                 a pretty good collection kind of                                 mystical tools and I think what you see                                 is that internal to any specific library                                 ap eyes are pretty consistent and have a                                 high degree of functionality but when                                 you immediately experience doing one of                                 these stuffing in pythons that it's just                                 not structured from the granite run                                 analytics rate this panda structure is                                 not what's feeding into all the tools                                 it's kind of islands of libraries that                                 are very well done it is an s like my                                 name is you're doing                                 the science but you also just don't have                                 the ability the language level to kind                                 of to correct that's right you don't                                 have the power to build these                                 enforceable abstractions you know these                                 types to relieve remedy these kind of                                 different structures so your left hand                                 tunnel it's kind of ad hoc arbitrary or                                 a manipulation just to get things from                                 defeated into visualization library or                                 around and this is just not ideal and so                                 far it is similarly with this dynamic                                 language of a nice interactive                                 environment and we have this ring                                 structure that is very nice and is the                                 root language Ruby Tom you know                                 consistent numeric abstraction beautiful                                 modern translation tools like ggplot and                                 every statistical method that has ever                                 been conceived has at least five                                 locations it is its same language                                 writing a pls scheme but what is what it                                 is this kind of next ready we have                                 macros lazy evaluation first-class                                 functions we know we can make this mess                                 dsl for doing regressions and the data                                 set is lazily evaluated it's our and all                                 these these things are pressure on this                                 frame we have the frame which which does                                 exist before of language we assume that                                 we have a visualization library maybe a                                 bit a bit where it accepts this frame if                                 statistical methods they accept this                                 print is nice and how the one who has                                 been doing a lot of really good work to                                 kind of make this even more consistent                                 but at the roids just I mean things like                                 he's correct to find an element on list                                 like weird assignment things I've never                                 understood actually how to get things                                 France ggplot                                                          mean it's this kind of ad hoc API                                 edition that's definitely not                                 commutative right of any kind of link                                 these things together Beauty emerges                                 nice but then all this academic band and                                 wearing things just to work I mean it's                                 just it's unified but it's just not it's                                 a crazy language makes it difficult or                                 code we don't have this consistency                                 Coast projects so we see the same                                 pathways these insanely inconsistent                                 unpredictable a few guys things are                                 difficult to reason about performance is                                 generally not very dated and we saw its                                 rules for building systems in the large                                 rates

        conference pretty Scala you should be                                 ready to kind of leap forward you're                                 right i mean function programming                                 shouldn't be the eradication of all this                                 arbitrariness introduction compile                                 errors and it's beautiful compulsion

same                                 time we should also be able to have a                                 flexibility bar but there's just no                                 reason that we can't you have this nice                                 people these are the nice tools I mean                                 Scala really should be a first-class                                 contender in this there's just no reason                                 for it not to be great I'm sure every                                 morning thats always XKCD recently right

 chef Matt                                 and maybe that's bad if you're not doing                                 up straight exploit should you do so i                                 think i think absolutely java here and i                                 think we should be able to provide the                                 flexpay people actually need from                                 language like our planning Iginla said                                 writing from is slavery or whatever but                                 this i think we could provide what is                                 actually needed with but also provide                                 extensible uniform abstractions and                                 crackers and so what do we see to the                                 right we do scholar to change the lot of                                 sense to make great memories a lot has                                 come up with all these different tools                                 saddle spire breathe smellin ope with                                 scala notebook and algebra heard about a                                 lot of these today and this is say that                                 we have a frame structure would fold the                                 i modeled after in fact developed one of                                 the founders of pandas we have                                 performing America abstraction for                                 generic programming in this great NLP in

   agreeable with it really promotes the                                 kind of reproducibility of reusing code                                 collaboration and we can do some                                 visualization                                                           is also letting us kind of really                                 leverage these abstractions also first                                 your banana leaves right so this we                                 should have a lot of the ground work                                 done to provide this really nice                                 environment ok so we've seen inspire a                                 lot today it's terrific bush and love                                 it's absolutely absolutely great for                                 providing these these core numeric                                 abstractions this should be able to be                                 reused across all these deliveries like                                 I am working I don't know how much                                 revealed you open source on the position                                 line be right now and aspires just been                                 we've been outstanding able to cremate                                 statistical methods you want an                                 immunization they can work up with a                                 bigdecimal level is there something you                                 want scale data before and after its                                 visualization Community Chest and even                                 if it's just for providing a kind of                                 uniform standard library of numbers the                                 top of all of Java's kind of numeric                                 types it's just an outstanding a step                                 forward the more toughness level plus by                                 today and saddle is there's a really                                 great first step for suffering                                 structuring scalloped I think there's                                 some things which can be some kind of                                 emphasis maybe I is just in terms of                                 naming convention which is as a minor                                 the thing that I've been harping on a                                 lot today that I think should be                                 addressed is the heterogeneous impact                                 case because I don't think that's a                                 place where it will settle really is the                                 best because it's its basic type is the                                 row index typed the column index type                                 and the value type and so if you're                                 doing ahead of genius we're left with                                 the value type of any they provide you                                 with methods for for kind of sub setting                                 a specific type T of your                                 but I don't think that's quite as good                                 for this kind of experimental work foot                                 or even lots of sword and stuff and this                                 isn't me we have a fact in schol we                                 don't really have good record knives                                 right what would Howard any of you will                                 take this room and so I think one reason                                 i have really tried too hard when this                                 point is that i think we do kind of now                                 have a way that was done just say we                                 have shapeless and i think that there's                                 a really hoping to put forth this                                 argument this would be a really great                                 use case for shapeless i think is                                 something really important for us kala                                 and you could be a way it really                                 showcases library with good traction                                 could actually have strongly types of                                 energy                                 and also he doesn't support pic as my                                 box which isn't a huge do you do its                                 prominence working with but kind of poor                                 job secrecy's skyline LP which was                                 formerly known as Scala is a really                                 great tool for students for linear                                 algebraic tasks and a great core library                                 cystic methods I just focus on the NLP                                 side but this little folks in NLP side                                 of things it's not those full featured                                 in terms of kind of a lot of things you                                 want but it's it's really this is                                 particularly because it is coming out of                                 Stanford a lot of these NLP to use here                                 so we're really kind of starting to see                                 various research communities take on                                 scholar and a lot of them are building                                 on top of the stuff that they're using                                 like this not Scala agrees tools like we                                 have a lot there is it that one allowed                                 with the UT Austin is making the                                 University of Maryland is also doing a                                 lot of Stanford's also put up a topic                                 modeling toolkit I mean you have lots of                                 really pretty great research tools there                                 now be done in Scala Vegas and one of                                 these big difficulties to overcome our                                 is just that all the reasons you run                                 here and we'll be done here so getting                                 this kind of momentum to it's                                 really huge I think the more we as                                 community work environment in this world                                 let me just tell notebook which I think                                 making handlers are some really great                                 presentations on they recommend that                                 people read watch those online it's                                 really improved the people that modern                                 web tools any method that outputs this                                 kind of HTML structure will be                                 visualized when you create interactive                                 tools it's really nice it does need some                                 more work on usability I think it's a                                 little bit difficult                                 present to just kind of start up a new                                 project you have to incorporate it into                                 your SBT build less make your way when                                 you can say work with scrum it's ok so                                 we have all these really nice things and                                 I want to stressors that I think that                                 they need to really think about this                                 that coming together these different                                 tools because they are all the disparate                                 right I mean so one thing we don't                                 really have any modern seen translation                                 tools in Scala especially one that                                 operates at any of these kind of court                                 date assertions of the libraries almost                                 everything works with doubles or the                                 mcdonalds hard coded specialization I                                 think we'll need to work on this hed                                 urgency type saddle frame possibly some                                 shapeless and I think what I really want                                 to stress is that I think of each of                                 these things has a really well defined                                 domain and I want to stress that thing's                                 try to stick to doing one thing and                                 doing it really well in outsourcing the                                 rest of these other libraries I think                                 you know the spires networking for                                 splitting algebra library now breezes                                 its own abstract algebraic type so it's                                 algebra saddle is reproducing all the                                 matrix operations that the breeze has                                 done and then especially when we see                                 everyone has gone through the horrors of                                 doing all this specialization logic in                                 their libraries which is really hard to                                 get right and it's crucial to rely on so                                 I think really the more that we keep and                                 step right up these domains of                                 abstraction I think we can do really                                 well and really pretty                                 because the bar is really really think                                 we can probably use you some more really                                 it's just what this mall right Maggie                                 and I think we have the gravity momentum                                 in solid for doing the analytics is                                 pretty huge and most places that you                                 spell those these are doing it for big                                 data analytics right sparks just got                                    million dollars Anderson reporting so I                                 think there is this huge amount of                                 momentum and I think we really have the                                 library here it's not like we're                                 starting from scratch I think we have                                 really high quality libraries just that                                 if you can kind of work to get them                                 together I think we'll have a really                                 first-class statistical violence and so                                 yeah I guess you can say you know the                                 Artic coordinating multiple projects                                 over Twitter the age of github this kind                                 of horrible problem that isn't                                 descending that look at how but we do                                 have this kind of tendency to create                                 these tools released into the world as                                 our mobile domain and don't really think                                 about the ecosystem so yeah and I mean                                 it's kind of a kitchen I think it's                                 really in our interest at scholar                                 developers to promote state of affairs                                 respect to higher than the fan of your                                 own lives if we can really have a next                                 generation people who are using Scotland                                 and finally the thetic it's actually                                 really able to production can be done                                 well right we have the same abstractions                                 for kind of working small with their                                 data as when we go out or big duper                                 spark or whatever cluster I think it's                                 really a chance to showcase off to                                 declare                                 and it's some widespread adoption                                 personal use abstraction so this in the                                 talk I really wanted to try and get                                 together like a little Google Group to                                 kind of promote discussions hacking                                 projects to get some prototypes out                                 there and how these things can work                                 together it because it's obviously not a                                 trivial problem how this house works out                                 it's completely untrue but I think it's                                 very much yeah                                 how close do you think Scala notebooks                                 like visualization stuff is to where you                                 think it needs to be I mean it seems                                 like that sort of the week a piece of                                 the puzzle right yeah I mean that's why                                 I said right because you can incorporate                                 it with like d                                                          d                                                                 something said about like the kind of                                 grammar of graphics though I think I                                 like deep through a lot it's been                                 actually perfectly stuff look like                                 buckets for your projects but I think I                                 really think this is this grammar                                 graphics it's really nice for the kind                                 of data science work for you do and have                                 a kind of core you want this a middle                                 ground between d                                                     always want this chart library you want                                 these sensible abstractions they say                                 everyone this is with this is                                 fascinating maybe some color stuff so I                                 think it's a really nice different                                 something the best solutions out there                                 now yeah even doing d                                                better                                 is that one fifth one to add to your own                                 this there is a company doing our                                 integration once mark set up being                                 so yeah I've seen several things there's                                 some crazy things like our fermentation                                 to the GBM and it was all these I saw                                 that I think we haven't had a chance to                                 include yeah you know being able to kind                                 of sources in my scholar rapper very                                 powerfully I I don't know anything about                                 a sub greater you're in question what's                                 the difference between the sense of a                                 frame and just a list of some Google                                 third what what's what is it that                                 elicits tuples doesn't reduce                                 abstractions I think one minute                                 community okay well someone you don't                                 have a chilling effect maker you want                                 the columns not so just the rate that we                                 want to have for this experiment we have                                 all these different data points there                                 are different types right and we need                                 around there differently type record                                 types and we wanted to be index because                                 you want to be able to easily just say                                 what's this for this this and in the                                 other thing that you're doing this bring                                 the destruction works those emissions is                                 seeing you want this frame shirt that's                                 been into things and obviously also when                                 um when you're getting into like                                 sometimes physical model is it's going                                 to have to pull out at some point a                                 major exploreamerica they'd open so want                                 a structure that really works for this                                 kind of experimentation phase with these                                 great indexes and this                                 nice functional API it's you want to be                                 close to work lists the scholar you want                                 to be fast indexed heterogeneity typed                                 and have a really easy way to transform                                 implicitly into some kind of                                 high-performance make its way so it's                                 yep indexing the heterogeneous types how                                 it really is kind of high performance                                 single types measures                                 when you talk about heterogeneity act                                 like the element level not just you know                                 different columns having different types                                 you know but the column itself is                                 uniform but the case where the call was                                 not even formed do you primarily mean                                 like different numeric types or i mean                                 are you talking like you know some                                 random string data mixed in or like and                                 and if its string data are you talking                                 about all the possible different sort of                                 DC realizations of that string data or                                 just the fact that it's string day like                                 it's you know if I guess I'm the thing                                 I'm not sure about cuz I don't go bar                                 very well is like are you imagining                                 actually deserialising all your strings                                 into like different weird case classes                                 and stuff ahead of time where are you                                 matching some kind of like d                                 serialization framework for the data                                 frame actually that it does that for you                                 figured out what it is or something on                                 the fly dynamically I mean yes I'm                                 mostly interested in case words yeah I                                 mean so you could have some categorical                                 variable you could imagine having these                                 kind of cases that are happening this                                 yes I most interest in the case where it                                 is kind of a consistently type violence                                 maybe when you some a dimension to the                                 sorting great I don't know anything                                 about handed so what do I need to know                                 that they to know what viable about it                                 that's missing from selling well so so                                 pandas I mean immediately it's in Python                                 sorts it's very similar api's rights I                                 don't want this thing like I'm at be                                 harsh on Sally I think this is Henry                                 Phoenix I'm just really serious problem                                 just want to clear that pipe let me get                                 that for free bit because you don't have                                 you can just have interviews the type of                                 things you rent store so it immediately                                 gets this this heterogeneous case and so                                 we can express this kind of Tidy data                                 abstraction and that's the name for me                                 and it's a car American a speeded we                                 don't Python their scholars should be                                 able to offer we have the tools to                                 provide that abstractions column entered                                 using types columns and so we shouldn't                                 have to just resort to any reports                                 cultural questions I noticed like                                 beautiful especially television New York                                 knows whether financial company is                                 swimming in tuscola and I do my                                 observations their leases before and I                                 wish the money like flown by and more                                 focused                                                             whatever Ishta and stuff so I'm just                                 Chris what is it about this new major                                 financial companies use a smallish                                 thinks this bootleggers Kevin Oliver is                                 there sort of the culture where you know                                 a source of use is encouraged you find                                 this is useful for the community like                                 the phone is busted I mean I can't speak                                 too feisty on me now you can add                                 something like a data scientist writing                                 that I have never I never worked the                                 comments before this what you propose it                                 so I can speak to that I mean I ask                                 Allah developer who cares about the                                 tools that we have for working with I                                 think it's a really important problem                                 we've just seen you know seriously                                 packages for things like Excel of habits                                 and bad to lose lack of type CP really                                 concrete impacts the tools we have                                 access to data and now things that you                                 just closed                                 you
