Title: Pacific Northwest Scala 2013 Akka in Production: Our Story by Evan Chan
Publication date: 2020-01-27
Playlist: Pacific Northwest Scala 2013
Description: 
	Everyone in the Scala world is using or looking into using Akka for low-latency, scalable, distributed or concurrent systems. We want to share our story of developing and productionizing multiple Akka apps, including low-latency ingestion and real-time processing systems, and Spark-based applications.

When does one use actors vs futures?
Why did we go with Logback instead of Akka's built-in logging?
Can we use Akka with, or in place of, Storm?
How did we set up instrumentation and monitoring in production?
How does one use VisualVM to debug Akka apps in production?
What happens if the mailbox gets full?
What is our Akka stack like?
We will share best practices that we've discovered when building Akka and Scala apps, pitfalls and things we'd like to avoid, and a vision of where we would like to go for ideal Akka monitoring, instrumentation, and debugging facilities.
