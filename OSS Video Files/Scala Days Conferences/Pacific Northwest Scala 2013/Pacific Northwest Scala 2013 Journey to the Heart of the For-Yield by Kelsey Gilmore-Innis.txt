Description: 
	Options and IOs and Iteratees, oh my! If you've poked around at Scala you've seen it--the ubiquitous for-comprehension sprinkled through idiomatic Scala code. As it turns out, what looks like a bit of syntactic sugar to ease prosaic list manipulation is actually a super powerful structure for abstracting away all kinds of common operations in a safe and maintainable way. It allows you to take full advantage of type safety and pushes the work of setting up boilerplate to the compiler. We'll break down exactly what's going on in a for-comprehension and explore some of the wild and wonderful structures that can be used within one. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the real-world benefits of functional programming.
