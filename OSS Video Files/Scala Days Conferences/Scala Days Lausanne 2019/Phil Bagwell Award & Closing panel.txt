hi how did we like this year's Scala

00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:17,609
holidays

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:19,109
alright yeah you know I do want to take

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,250
an opportunity to thank everybody for a

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,500
wonderful conference this has been

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,619
amazing so far and I'm honored to be on

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,480
stage here to promote the community

00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,340
through a cool thing that we have called

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,759
the Phil Bagwell Memorial Scholar

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,079
Community Award so what is this this is

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,940
an award that we try to give to

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,340
individuals that we think have made a

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,050
significant contribution to the

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,110
community to building the community we

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,760
want to have right this this this is

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,219
this is on the website you can see the

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,480
the link there for what this award is

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,460
what it means but we're looking for

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,370
people who are encouraging welcoming

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,579
humble optimistic and kind I met Phil

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,559
Bagwell 10 years ago at this conference

00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:01,170
and he he was one of the first piece

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,489
people to welcome you know as in his new

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,049
country I was in Switzerland and never

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,570
been here before he was one of the first

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,130
people to welcome me in and you know

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,659
you're just talking to him you have no

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,189
idea who this person is he's welcoming

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,049
to you and you find out oh he's the one

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,360
who invented the data collection behind

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,850
vector right like very very cool very

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,340
humble guy really welcoming awesome I

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:28,500
think Martin was going to give us a film

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:31,680
a ghost story quick so I met Phil some

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,140
years earlier I think it was 2007 he

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
came to my office I just knocked on the

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,380
door and says well you know I have this

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,960
problem I have this idea for the sort of

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,140
immutable lists which are more efficient

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,299
than hash constant and constant lists

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,880
and I'm thinking of submitting it to a

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,829
conference how do I make sure that the

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,380
program committee will not steal my idea

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,060
I said well they're not typically in the

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,549
business of doing that but if you're

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,219
concerned and the typical thing is you

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,790
do a tech report and you can do one with

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,770
my group

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,409
so essentially you can publish it as an

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,300
EP if the tech report which he did so I

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,849
taught him about academic publishing and

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,670
then he

00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:14,500
and taught me about reaching out to the

00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,409
community because he was really an

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,870
expert in that he his previous job was

00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:24,280
as a as a marketing manager for digital

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:26,709
equipment at the time and what he really

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,269
could do is he could really encouraged

00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:33,220
mentor encouraged enthusiasts other

00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:35,950
people he was absolutely great in that

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,260
and he he lost us far too early he

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,209
couldn't come if he went to the first

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,790
two holidays he couldn't come to the

00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:46,160
third one anymore so we decided to name

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:51,360
this award in his name

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,360
[Applause]

00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,150
so in addition to just you know the the

00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,130
traits that we saw unfilled that we'd

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,290
like to encourage we wanted to look for

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,300
one of three different criteria in

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,280
candidates and it could be one or more

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,720
of these things we this thing we call

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,030
technical benefaction this is just

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,770
people who contribute a lot of technical

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,390
content to the community you know

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,550
they're doing libraries they're the

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,140
unsung heroes of what makes Scala tick

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,790
we want to throw up people who

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,340
evangelize these are people go out to

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,620
the the external programming world not

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,930
just in the scala microcosm but but

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,640
beyond and bring people in and make it

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:28,770
welcoming for newcomers teach this

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,390
message that Scala is easy to learn and

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,209
it's a good language and we have good

00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,920
people activism is building up the

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,350
community and changing the shape of the

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,910
community in a healthy way making this a

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:44,100
better community a community we want to

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,300
be a part of so with that said we have a

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,820
little bit of a problem with this

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:51,570
process because we actually didn't

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,459
announce it 2018 winner so you're

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,769
actually gonna get to see two winners

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,410
this this this time we're gonna have to

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,870
announce the 2018 winter and the 2019

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,220
winner and so we have two two winners

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:08,870
here and I think they're both very

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:11,690
deserving so for 2018 we have chosen

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:21,209
kenji yoshida I don't

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:21,209
[Applause]

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,640
we're not sure if Kenji is one person

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,100
except I did I have met him he's very

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,980
nice and just very outstanding technical

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,340
contributions throughout the community

00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:37,620
it has a lot of a lot of activity I I

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,150
can't remember a project I ever worked

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,130
on in Scala that didn't have a commit

00:04:39,150 --> 00:05:12,510
from Kenji and we have a short little

00:04:41,130 --> 00:05:15,300
video for him so congrats on Phil back

00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,610
all word thanks for your contributions

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,650
skull ecosystem over the years your

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,780
passion for functional programming and

00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,270
dedication to the Scala ecosystem is

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,040
really inspirational I want to thank you

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,560
especially for the for request even

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,350
sending for open source project or SVT

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,230
or skull migrations thanks again

00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,180
I can't you probably don't remember this

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,990
you reviewed the first core request I

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,630
ever made

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,030
- line pull request and I had two typos

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:46,830
in it and it was but your your your

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,850
contributions are so numerous and

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,950
arrived so rapidly that it's really hard

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,660
for me to understand how you are just a

00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,760
single person so this is really well

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,190
deserved

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,100
hi there this is my seven at skull base

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:09,560
2019 here in Gaza for its anniversary

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:18,450
and this is just a message for me

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:23,250
mentioning one kenji yoshida who has

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:26,750
been the amazingly prolific author of

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,889
numerous for requests directly towards

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,939
libraries of mine libraries

00:06:28,889 --> 00:07:02,729
attained right across colleges he's done

00:06:32,939 --> 00:07:04,590
an incredible service so you shooter son

00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:05,310
was not able to be here today but on his

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,710
behalf

00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:15,629
Eugene Yokota has been communicating

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:17,370
with them and has some some words thank

00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:19,949
you I haven't gotten the material from

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:26,189
Yoshida song so I just like to thank my

00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:28,289
mom and and all the panels for the this

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,360
award I just want to share it like a few

00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:33,000
stories about you know your son you know

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,889
when you meet in person he's really shy

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,099
person but he's really kind hearted and

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,569
the I remember like a few years ago when

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:41,969
I went to scar Matsui

00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm normally live in your eyesight's so

00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:47,789
I don't know many people in Tokyo but he

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,159
just casually like asked me on Twitter

00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,539
or something and say hey you want to go

00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:54,180
out for dinner and something like that

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,680
and the you know he's just like men and

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,370
we talked about different scholars stuff

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,870
and so the interesting thing about his

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,960
background like speaking of like a

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,779
diversity is that he didn't get computer

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,539
science degree in his college his major

00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:10,110
is actually in the traditional Asian

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:14,580
calligraphy

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,409
so the his Twitter handle he's based in

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,770
Japan but his Twitter handle and the

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:23,520
github handle Shui K right it's actually

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,930
uh like an old Chinese the Renaissance

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,050
person who mastered the poetry and drama

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,029
writing and painting and calligraphy and

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,110
he went to a very traditional school

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,640
that studies this thing and for him the

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,349
programming was basically in a way of

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,770
sort of like he learned it through

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,110
on-the-job

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,110
and overdose like an evolution of Scala

00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,570
he's obviously learned mastered was sort

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,040
of the the various aspects of the

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,730
language spec and the functional

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,980
programming so in one of the any Scala I

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,570
think II you know he wasn't there but a

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,100
bunch of functional programmers were

00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,910
kind of like talking over the pier like

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:06,339
how does he find this bug because I'm

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:10,060
pretty sure no one has ever come across

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:12,190
this particular code path so I asked him

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,830
you know in over I don't know Twitter or

00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,140
in person like how do you find these

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,520
kind of things and his answer was that

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:24,100
he used to download the source code of

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,880
you know like Zaid or the Scala on his

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:32,680
iPad and he literally reads it like a

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:35,440
book he literally reads it and

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,110
understands that like a book because you

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,760
know you know he his his English reading

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,000
has improved over the course of years

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,399
but his mode of communication basically

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,190
with the english-speaking majority of

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,959
the open source is through code so he

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,390
wanted to really really get it right and

00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,160
understand the code and when he sends a

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,279
poor request he wants to be able to

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,160
basically communicate through that so

00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:02,680
that's just like mind-blowing way of

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,720
thinking about it and yeah and yeah

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,390
everyone knows like the amount of

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,670
contribution he's made when when when he

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,440
was on the paternal leave I think he

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,940

authentication after following on

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,709
Twitter I can't think of a better

steward role model evangelist for the

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:16,029
community we need more people that would

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,529
never even think of inlining xml and

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:21,790
their other one is perfectly good code

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:24,189

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,410

of the world some real hope some chance

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,029
of salvation something they can cling to

00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:32,139
and and that's not nothing so I hope

00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:34,329
you're there feeling proud of yourself

00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:42,100
enjoying the day you're getting off easy

00:13:34,329 --> 00:13:44,139
but don't go too hard stand up to ten at

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:58,480
this very moment somewhere below be

00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:59,670
there is a scholarship would you like

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,660
scope insanity

00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,660
[Applause]

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,010
thank you all III just want to say thank

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,380
you to everybody who has ta tour planned

00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:23,220
a workshop Scala bridge would not be

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:27,180
possible without you so thank you okay

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,310
let's hear me so that's that's it for

00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,170
the Phil Bagwell Awards if you check the

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:34,350
schedule right now now we we move into

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:37,590
the closing panel normally the closing

00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,270
panel is really informal and it's more

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,300
for you than it is for us we're not up

00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,370
here you know like saying profound

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,260
things too you know preaching anything

00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,540
it's really to try and create a little

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,840
bit of a dialogue between you know

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:54,200
everybody here and the the folks that

00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,270
you might know from the stage here so

00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,850
we're going to before we kind of get

00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,620
into the the full panel I know that not

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,210
everybody knows everybody on stage I

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,640
think we know who Martin is and Kelly at

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:07,730
this point but I think we should we're

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,020
gonna do a quick round of introductions

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,590
one thing about the introductions since

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:15,960
since Bogdan had this really cool app

00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:20,160
thingy that he did today I'm going to

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,720
use it as well so we're going to do a

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,640
little round of introductions and I want

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,820
you to kind of help because the goal is

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,760
to try and point out who is telling a

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,170
lie about their history so everybody on

00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,190
the panel here is going to give you

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,410
they're gonna introduce themselves of

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,450
course they're gonna tell you their name

00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,100
you know maybe you know what they do how

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,900
they how they how you might know them

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,390
from Scala and then they're going to

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,130
give you two facts or rather two pieces

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:46,260
of information right one is true one is

00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,180
false and so it's going to be quite

00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,980
funny to see you know what you think is

00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,210
the true or the false one we're gonna do

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,710
that real quick before we get into the

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,480
actual panel discussion so we all kind

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,740
of know who these people are and I'm

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,290
glad that everybody is already like

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,750
logged on look at this is great okay so

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:03,150
we're going to start with Eugene

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,889
so intro and two things about you one

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,989
true one false I

00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:13,470
Eugene I'm member of the like that and

00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:17,910
Scala team you can't vote yet come on

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:21,129
the maintainer of SBT so two facts are

00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:24,009
one that is I'm electro vegetarian so I

00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:27,579
choose and yogurt but no meat products

00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:33,040
oh and the second is that I like German

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:34,709
electronic music techno alright which

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,899
seems more believable please tell me

00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:43,119
some people know Eugene so I hope that

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:44,709
they're right ok it seems like people

00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:46,299
think that you're into techno and that

00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:49,059
you're not elective it to Terry will

00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:51,519
give you like a few more seconds so what

00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:56,169
is true you see my Twitter feed I a

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,720
kebab after the community party yes and

00:16:56,169 --> 00:17:00,879

okay so Story number two is the true

00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:12,220
ones you are into minimal electronic

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:13,480
music cool oh yes thank you actually hey

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,639

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,189
mean that was that was also intended so

00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:19,329
where do you work what do you do how do

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:26,019
we know you from the scala community

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:29,679
tell us yes good basically maintaining

00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:32,320
SPG and yeah you may also know Scala XV

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,700
which is the XML data binding tool that

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:41,429
others some people use that's pretty

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,429

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:15,909
okay you can do it I can do it let's see

00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:18,600

sorry sorry

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,550
already eight people voted so I don't

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,660
even know it's but I'm glad that they

00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,490
chose the first one because obviously

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:44,080
that's supposed to be correct yeah okay

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:49,170
fine so you like you like salsa I've had

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,170
I've had Starbucks before this one story

00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:00,010
and the other story is that I invented

00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:06,880
Haskell all right this one's good I like

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:09,480
this one oh my god can I just say thank

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,160
you for voting for number two I'm not

00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,970
proud of it but I have had one cup of

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,010
espresso from Starbucks before all right

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,170
so the wait wait float state the truth

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,540
the truth restated so people here know I

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,060
have in my life had like literally one

00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,410
cup of espresso from Starbucks and this

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,300
is like my moment of telling everybody

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,260
about it because I've been hiding this

00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,760
for a long time and I actually I came to

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,250
Scala because I couldn't figure out

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,810
Haskell so you know it's number number

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,120
one is this true sorry

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:46,560
I know a certain professor we have a

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:51,220
sales support groups tomorrow all right

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:54,280
on to Josh oh yes I'm Josh I don't have

00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,580
a last name you can say your last name

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,950
correctly cuz I'll say it wrong it yeah

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,800
so my last name is interesting it's a

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:06,040
blended mix of German and French because

00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,480
my ancestors apparently were French

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,720
maybe maybe German not sure so but yeah

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,850
it's surrett with that nice silent H on

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,870
it perfect yeah I've always said it

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:21,640
wrong yeah okay anyway III wrote I wrote

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,320
a book at one point in time some people

00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,030
might have read it some people might not

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,040
remember it now it's called scale in

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,160
depth and I did a lot with the Schuyler

00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,299
community for my two stories the first

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,419
one is

00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:35,649
I'm gonna take from Adrienne possibly

00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:41,259
there are things that people know me for

00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:42,609
so I never wear socks and I invented my

00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:47,830
own programming language that is

00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:48,669
published in an academic journal all

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:57,549
right let's go

00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:59,739
what do you think most believable one

00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,859
they all right

00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:05,049
yeah sure you say go for it yeah yeah so

00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:07,359
there's a April Fool's Day academic

00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:10,229
journal and I made a language called

00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:13,929
lambda doggy that is designed for dogs

00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:15,369
and yeah that's true and yeah you can

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:16,599
find it on Google Scholar the article

00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,629
it's a sig Babak paper right oh yeah

00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:23,349
perfect

00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:25,599
all right on to Martin yeah I'm I'm

00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:29,190
Martin and I invented SCADA that's

00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:33,249
that's a fact is that one of the stories

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,169
so so the stories is number one and my

00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:39,460
first programming language was actually

00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:44,619
four and five and number two scanner was

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:48,309
first called Scola from school like s

00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:53,830
wait how do you spell it SC o L a but

00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:55,869
then we decided I changed people don't

00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:00,639
have have faith in the in the naming

00:21:55,869 --> 00:22:04,479
thing do they all right whatwhat's true

00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:09,789
so one is false my first programming

00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:13,179
language was Algol 60 Fortran five most

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:16,149
people were very wrong and number two is

00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:18,429
true because SCADA was first an acronym

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:20,499
for a software composition language so

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,299
SCO but then that sounded too much like

00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:26,519
school and most people don't like school

00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:26,519
so we changed it to scalable language

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,659
so that's like I had no clue that's

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:37,899
amazing

00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:39,850
alright holdin I'm holdin I work at

00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:42,720
Google or I haven't checked my email

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:46,419
today I probably still work at Google I

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,809
work on Apache spark mostly that's

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:51,549
probably you know she wrote a lot of

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:57,039
books on Apache spark that I think most

00:22:51,549 --> 00:23:01,179
of us read yeah I'm very sorry for that

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:05,230
whole thing yeah it's an example of repo

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:09,760
is bad anyways okay so story story

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:13,269
number one is Oh whoever did that thank

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:19,059
you okay my stuffed animals name is a

00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:21,130
rainbow and Story number two is that

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:26,039
every night I fall asleep with a stuffed

00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:26,039
animal that's this is hard actually

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:35,710
yeah it's gonna be one is false one

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:40,750
today what what happens JavaScript

00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:42,970
probably wait this isn't Scala yes well

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:48,070
I don't know we can ask them but I don't

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:51,399
know all right okay it would appear that

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,880
most people know that rainbow is my wife

00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:57,070
stuffed animal and so every night I fall

00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,899
asleep with a stuffed animal okay so you

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:04,960
guys were right for this one alright and

00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:07,690
last but not least Kelly hi I'm Kelly

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,630
I started Scala bridge I've also been

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,630
known to complain about free monads

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:17,320
I I work at Twilio which you may know

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:20,970
from your lanyards Story number one is

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,740
that Elon Musk blocked me on Twitter

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:40,030
story number two is that Donald Trump

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:41,860
blocked me on Twitter all right I think

00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,390
most people have voted so so either one

00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,919
would be an honor but Donald Trump

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,919
actually did block me on Twitter

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,740
[Applause]

00:24:52,289 --> 00:25:05,010
congratulations thank you it's it's my

00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:07,539
greatest honor hold on

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:11,650
yes we'll start question no this is not

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:15,159
correct oh my god what are you doing no

00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:19,030
nope all right so what I had intended to

00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,140
have here was a bunch of basically the

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:23,110
thing that Bogdan had done earlier were

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,360
you can suggest a topic to discuss and I

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,210
must have done it incorrectly however I

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,100
will I will fix that momentarily but in

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,720
the meantime I wanted to start everybody

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,650
off with a topic that I think that we're

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,929
all kind of wondering about so we we all

00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,270
saw several different talks this week

00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:43,030
about Scala 3 and what's coming right

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,830
and a lot of them were super cool and I

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,049
think there's really this visceral

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:49,570
excitement nowadays about you know what

00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:51,789
we see coming and you know there's a

00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:55,840
road map and everything seems like it's

00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:58,179
really you know on its way right so what

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,610
I you know the issue that I guess I

00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:03,640
wanted to to sort of you know pass to

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,380
the panel is a question of you know what

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,120
what next for the community and

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,549
community is everybody right so the

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,429
community is you know library authors

00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:14,559
the community is corporate users the

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:16,059
community so what should these folks be

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,490
doing how should people be preparing

00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:20,679
obviously educational resources

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,059
what should change right so I know you

00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,270
know we have these changes with implicit

00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:25,220
s'right so perhaps

00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,420
should change how we approach this when

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,220
I mean obviously we're not teaching

00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,570
beginners and plus it's however at some

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,520
point people discover them right and so

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,770
we have to change how we explain these

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,960
things to people completely right so I

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,270
have a range of kind of questions in it

00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,060
and you know everybody on stage here is

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,490
a big part of basically every corner of

00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,610
our of our ecosystem right build tools a

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,740
Pilar lead martin designing scala 3 josh

00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,300
has basically been writing a bunch of

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,130
books for scala for years and helping

00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,110
people all over the internet holden

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,970
works with spark right and we all know

00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,560
that spark upgrade slowly sometimes

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:01,310
sorry

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:02,930
and Kelly well aside from making fun of

00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,480
free monads I mean you have a lot of

00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,790
experience bringing you know newcomers

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,550
on teams and whatnot up to speed to be

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:12,110
able to contribute to you know an

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:13,670
actively moving team and in an industry

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,160
right so you all have you know

00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:17,810
interesting perspectives here and of

00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,270
course Martin you know could comment on

00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,940
his view for how we see how we should

00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,170
change how we educate people right but I

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,670
wanted to so we have all these

00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,840
viewpoints and we can actually discuss a

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:29,840
few of them and I wanted to start

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:31,760
actually on the education point because

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,370
I think that that requires longer-term

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,020
thinking maybe how you know we're gonna

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:39,830
have to change a lot of things right or

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,840
or not so maybe Martin you wanna you do

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,390
you have any thoughts about you know how

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,950
do we how do we change you know the

00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:48,230
educational materials that we have or

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:51,680
how should we change our approach do we

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:54,620
or know the microphone you have so so

00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,840
yes yes I do think that essentially we

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,330
have to revise so it for me it will be

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,180
basically the the moment we have to

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,550
revise my scholar courses one thing that

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,560
well there's trivial things like we

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:08,720
dropped new there are more elaborate

00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,580
things like introduced enums early

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,520
because there are simpler path towards

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,620
data and there are more advanced things

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,420
like when you come to implicit x' then

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,920
we have to change it to delegates and

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,680
hopefully do better than last time

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,840
in fact this might my teaching I found

00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,210
that the teaching of him embrace it's

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,920
always was very disorganized and ad hoc

00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,720
and afterthought we never really

00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,430
properly taught them maybe because we

00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,410
didn't really have the good concepts to

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:36,020
teach them so that all that will will

00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,900
have to change and I'll revise the MOOCs

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:41,540
first in-class courses once I have done

00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,690
that for a year we will hopefully do do

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:47,300
the MOOC again we'll have to get books

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,460
teaching materials tutorials everything

00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:54,080
so it will be essentially a big epic

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:56,240
revision this is I mean I actually kind

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,030
of yeah this is beyond I guess Martin I

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,740
start with Martin right but I mean

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,420
onboarding new employees I mean this

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,059
does seem like something that we're

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,590
going to have to alter or or do you do

00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:08,120
do people believe that most of the

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,830
changes that are coming are not really

00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,010
targeted at the people who would be I

00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:17,090
don't know in an onboarding course or

00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:18,740
something at a large company well I have

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,870
the impression that anyway I mean things

00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,210
are very much in flux like the the

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,920
libraries that people would use today

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,720
are probably quite different from the

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,030
libraries people use three years ago so

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,059
I think for onboarding people you sort

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,220
of have to sort of upgrade continuously

00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:37,070
anyway so I don't think that would be a

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:44,360
bigger change than many others that that

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:48,500
that arise during time anybody else

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,330
Kelly perhaps or I mean we'll have to

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,080
look at rewriting the curriculum Knoll

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:55,640
you up for that so for this caliber I

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,950
mean so this would be the scholar bridge

00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,360
curriculum I suppose right yeah so one

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,500
of the one of the things that you have

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,970
to think about what that kind of stuff

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,920
is when you're writing tutorials for

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,110
people what we've thought about with

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,530
scholar bridge is we want people to have

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:11,600
a setup that they can then take to

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,490
continue on with courses like this are

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,900
in any kind of educational course that

00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:16,460
you're starting someone out with you

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,370
want to be able to empower them to

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,170
continue learning on their own scholar

00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,179
bridge is usually a one day workshop and

00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,580
so there's only so much that you can get

00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,830
through in one day and so I I'm hesitant

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,170
to upgrade scholar bridge to scholar 3

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,000
until it's at a point where the people

00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,590
that would be using that would also be

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,179
using Scala 3 and the rest of their

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,179
projects in their everyday life

00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,140
so I had a comment about that what what

00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,210
I find interesting about Dottie and

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,000
what's coming in Scylla 3 is there

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,620
there's a core scholar language that

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
actually directly translates between the

00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,790
two right and there are some things that

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,380
have changed like implicit but I don't

00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,940
think that core language changes and

00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,350
what I think it is interesting and I've

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,480
been thinking about this with the the

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,540
book that I wrote and and how I present

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,010
concepts is I think you can present that

00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,350
core language and teach people about

00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,880
that and it's powerful in itself and

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,740
then you can layer on some of these

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,120
advanced concepts and I think there's a

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,160
reshaping that's going to happen in the

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,020
community if we look at library

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,180
transitions right libraries are going to

00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,550
want to cross compile between scholar 3

00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,380
and Scylla 214 so they'll probably use

00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,720
the common subset between the two

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,370
initially and start to migrate right

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,020
that's just a natural thing that will

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,170
happen but I think our teaching might

00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:38,620
also want to follow that same pattern

00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:39,880
just and from a logical progression of

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,780
teaching people things I think it makes

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,340
sense yeah I mean my hope would be that

00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,810
it wouldn't be a big deal to introduce

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,990
scholar three to people and I think for

00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:51,880
newcomers if you have a situation where

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,740
they could use it on either language

00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,860
compiler or either version compiler that

00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:01,390
would obviously be ideal so the next

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:04,480
question or a direction that I had hoped

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:06,670
to to address thank you everybody for

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,580
the way I appreciate this because I feel

00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:10,270
like we don't we like to talk about

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,590
migration and other things like this

00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,850
before we like to talk about how we're

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,490
going to present this to people who are

00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,710
or just you know happening upon scholar

00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,330
right so it's nice to perhaps start with

00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,180
with you know how do we how do we

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:24,640
navigate newcomers right sort of the

00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,730
next question that that I wanted to hear

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,930
from from folks on the panel was

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,600
basically the question of you know what

00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:34,030
what can the community do to ready for

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,010
this transition so I know between

00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,200
Adrienne and Martin and the folks at

00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:41,080
EPFL in the folks that you know are

00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,490
touching the the new stuff at the new

00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,460
Dottie

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,500
you know developments at light bend you

00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,510
know they have synchronized on various

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,890
plans for you know how to consider

00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:54,760
transitioning but what about everybody

00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:56,710
else should people be attempting to

00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,260
target some of the RCS that are coming

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,330
out and you know release libraries

00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,100
against them is that a good idea or you

00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,570
know what what what is the way forward

00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,820
for everybody for everybody who is

00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,290
excited about this change they want to

00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,470
get started helping now but what should

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,470
they do

00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:17,970
yeah eat your vegetables and eat your

00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,970
deprecation warnings

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,020
yeah I agree actually I think cross

00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:25,360
building is gonna be you know important

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,040
and we're of course looking with 2-14

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,990
how to smooth the migration path and

00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,400
that's what the conversation that we're

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,980
gonna start after Scala days with the

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,690
2-14 roadmap is what are some of the

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:36,010
features that make sense to back board

00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,660
of course a lot of the advanced stuff

00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:41,320
that can't happen because it requires a

00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:44,020
fundamentally new compiler but things

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,380
like top-level definitions or you know

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:49,180
maybe eum's and other things like that I

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,850
think would make a lot of sense into 14

00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,830
to enlarge to subset the common share

00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:57,580
except set between to 14 or 3-0 even

00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:59,800
more it's always appreciated to build

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,840
against milestones and RCS and let us

00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,280
know how it goes we try to do that

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,800
proactively with the community build but

00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,230
we can't build everything and so you

00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,910
know whatever project you have trying it

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,740
out on milestones in our ceases and

00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,990
letting us know HUD codes is always

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,760
really appreciated but not necessarily

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:18,700
like releasing for a public consumption

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,190
or just to see if I guess like you know

00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:23,770
should we be trying to you know build

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:26,110
stuff and and in release or things are I

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,760
mean you know if it's a library it

00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,050
should be fully across version so that

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,080
it's clear that it's built against a

00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,250
milestone or an RC I guess then the

00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,810
question would be I guess what I'm

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,060
asking is like transitive dependencies

00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,680
and whatnot so you know you need a

00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,140
Dottie whatever version of something

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,400
compiled to you know so there's a little

00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,780
bit of bootstrapping in the community

00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,030
and should we do that is that like is it

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,740
I think yes and no I mean like as we as

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,930
you know both Martin and Lucas's talk

00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,240
have have explained is that you know the

00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:55,330
newer compiler can can compile against

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,200
the older like against jars produced by

00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,430
the older compile

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,020
that's already the case now Ford

00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:03,190
audience Kyle 2:12 it will continue to

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:06,079
be the case for Scala 3 and and and 2:14

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:08,119
and so the way I see it is that the

00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,099
ecosystem will bootstrap that way

00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,280
because there will be a 2-14 ecosystem

00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:16,880
and the 3:0 ecosystem can consume the

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,650
parts that haven't made the jump yet so

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:24,910
I don't know if that if that answers

00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:26,359
your question it does yes I mean no this

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,430
is perfect

00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:29,960
I presume Martin probably has some

00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:34,040
opinions also home I got the build tool

00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,230
so please Eugene after Martin okay so so

00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,180
I think the the natural thing to happen

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,650
would be that for that like the next

00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:43,010
year or so when we on three three zero

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:45,530
milestones typically you would see new

00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:48,589
libraries or new versions of existing

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:51,200
libraries which have just like like the

00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:53,270
base color three language not yet the

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,040
same assumption of stability

00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,440
so essentially you would hopefully see

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,569
lots of experimentations and essentially

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,099
new versions of libraries coming out we

00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:03,440
see that already with like shapeless

00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:06,619
shapeless being completely redesigned

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,319
for scale of three and I would imagine

00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:11,390
that it would also be an opportunity for

00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:13,430
the type class heavy libraries to

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,990
actually have versions where they can

00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,210
play with the new features and just see

00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,040
see how it goes without having the

00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,010
assumption that this is already cast in

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,559
stone and I guess by the time we are

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:26,839
ready to thrips to ship 3 or 0 final

00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,819
that that then would sort of be a

00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,609
parallel movement in the libraries and

00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:32,839
then indeed cross building becomes also

00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,059
a big issue yeah

00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:36,859
but I believe library day equals this

00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,470
library ecosystem will start with sort

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:40,790
of fresh experiments right but I think

00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:43,160
shapeless is a good example because

00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:45,230
shape was 3 he will you know be

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,119
available 4 to 14 and 3-0 like it's

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,920
definitely one of the stated goals as

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,130
far as I know so far maybe have you

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,190
change your minds my worry

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:57,109
okay can we project the screen I just

00:36:55,190 --> 00:37:01,069
changed the the platform for for folks

00:36:57,109 --> 00:37:04,760
to ask questions on so I had intended to

00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:06,440
use the other one but didn't work so I'm

00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,640
gonna go around that to jeans turn next

00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,570
we're gonna continue on this question

00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,920
but

00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:12,590
I'd like you if you have questions that

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,630
you would like to have addressed here by

00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,360
a specific question specific person

00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,700
please feel free to drop your question

00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,700
in slide Oh Eugene

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,890
so the it's not particularly from the

00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:30,860
build tools perspective but you know if

00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,600
you haven't checked out Lucas's talk

00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,000
that was really good

00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,390
like I learned a lot just watching his

00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,760
talk about this exact topic of two to

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,370
three transitions so everyone like I

00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,440
recommend that and one of the major

00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,660
thing is that the a lot of the stuff

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,800
would continue to work basically it's

00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:54,350
three is two plus one and things like

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,020
implicit is kept there basically as a

00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,850
compatibility mode so a lot of the stuff

00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,830
will continue to work I think the I

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:03,880
think the major thing that would change

00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:08,960
is probably around the meta programming

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:10,640
like area right so the macro and the the

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,930
new style of the meta programming I

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,170
think will be the different parts so my

00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:19,670
comment there is the in the new world of

00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,730
the ecosystem there will be more

00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,440
libraries and I think as a community

00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:27,470
especially people who's sitting here

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,650
like many representing different library

00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:32,660
authors to have like empathy towards

00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:36,560
essentially like a future generation of

00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:39,080
the scholar new users so that we're not

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,350
just constantly pushing the boundaries

00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,020
but the think about like what the you

00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:48,680
know being friendly to the new users on

00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,390
learning this new paradigm and more

00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,340
towards like you know being friendly to

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,420
the new scientists or the data

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,920
scientists to use these features and

00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,380
essentially like kind of like use this

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,810
okay opinion it it's got a three as a

00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:05,510
template and follow along that as a

00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:08,680
guideline instead of doing like a

00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,680
weirder things basically

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:16,099
cool thank you is there anybody else too

00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,089
before we transition to the next

00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:20,150
question

00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:21,979
does anybody want to to weigh in on sort

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,869
of like what you think you know we as

00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:26,630
the community basically outside of

00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:28,930
everybody else right what folks should

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:31,759
should should try to do to help I mean

00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:33,170
actually a lot of I know this is a lot

00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:35,180
more at least for me it feels like a lot

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,859
more certainty about you know being able

00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:40,700
to go ahead and move forward and try

00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:43,819
things and it seems great but if there's

00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:46,130
any other thoughts opinions no yes I

00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:49,269
would like people to try and get sparked

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,049
building against the sky low 3 and

00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:53,630
ideally if you can get it building it

00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,299
doesn't have to work but like if anyone

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:59,960
has like a lot of free time and really

00:39:56,299 --> 00:40:02,869
like shell scripts I would love to see

00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,470
someone set up a CI for for spark

00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:08,239
against Scala 3 and and I think this

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,039
would also be true for other libraries

00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,220
maybe like that are important like

00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:14,569
sending it a CI up in conjunction with

00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,609
the people that work on the project

00:40:14,569 --> 00:40:18,829
otherwise so that they're aware of when

00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:21,140
they're making breaking changes so you

00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:24,460
know we hopefully don't accidentally

00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:27,380
take us ourselves a whole to fall into I

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:30,950
know I'm lazy though so someone else to

00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:34,339
do that so so I just want to make one

00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:36,589
point about the spark thing it's back

00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:39,410
through a spark doesn't built on SCADA 3

00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:43,039
yet would be great if it did but you can

00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:45,259
use spark from Scala 3 today and in fact

00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:48,319
we do that in our in our class so we had

00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:51,559
a first class of students this year who

00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:53,359
used spark from Scala 3 so it means if

00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,989
your spark user you know prevent it from

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:59,779
from using 3 right and Rennell told us

00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:02,359
that they don't use macro so shouldn't

00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:04,039
be too hard to upgrade yeah good job

00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:07,279
don't don't use macros if you want to

00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:09,619
okay okay so actually that was I mean so

00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:11,569
we automatically transit thanks Holden

00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:12,589
actually that was great because I mean I

00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,119
don't know if anybody wants to weigh in

00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:16,900
further to this question but like we you

00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,549
guys effectively just answered this so

00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,920
I'd really like to talk about the Trump

00:41:19,549 --> 00:41:23,960
question yeah my plans my plan is like

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,469
this is clearly the most you know

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,489
pressing question of this panel I

00:41:26,469 --> 00:41:31,460
figured that we should save the best for

00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:33,979
last though so we are definitely asking

00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,969
Kelly this question but we're gonna wait

00:41:33,979 --> 00:41:37,119
until the end if that's okay with

00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,119
everybody

00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:45,289
another very popular question though is

00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:49,400
you know so this is probably for maybe

00:41:45,289 --> 00:41:51,910
Jorge or Olaf if they're here but if

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:55,160
anybody on stage knows anything about

00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,900
what support for jdk 11 a bloopin metals

00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,759
I'm really excited that people are so

00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,589
excited by bloopin metals first of all

00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:03,349
I'm really thrilled different

00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:05,690
developments from you guys in the last

00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:10,339
year or two it's amazing

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:12,109
but I don't know Jorge Olaf if you're

00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:15,200
here will you stand up and yell what's

00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:16,789
gonna happen they're busy working on

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,440
this go are you kidding are you guys you

00:42:16,789 --> 00:42:23,089
got they're not here what is this

00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,339
alright well we can ask them on the

00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:29,869
internet I guess that's a pity so the at

00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:33,589
least at the sink level zinc 1/3 that's

00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:36,279
currently and the basically the our RC

00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:39,019
series two right now together with SB

00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:42,650
t13 is a first series that we're doing

00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:46,969
the integration testing fully on the

00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:49,789
adopt open JDK JDK 11 so we've made some

00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:51,769
few changes in there so hopefully that

00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:54,109
was you know bloop and met also follow

00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:58,119
quickly along once though you know

00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:58,119
changquan 3 becomes basically available

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:11,499
I heard very quietly somebody saying

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:13,150
bloop is out with JDK 11 that's a love I

00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:16,299
can't hear you I mean I can't see you so

00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:16,839
actually that's amazing so we we have

00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:20,619
the answer

00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:22,150
thank you all next question actually

00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:24,869
this is I think one that people have

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,549
been wondering it's for Martin of course

00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:30,430
what are your thoughts on eventually

00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:31,839
putting like I don't know a richer

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,859
version of dependent types of this gala

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:40,089
Adrienne look away yeah look at the

00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:42,609
light instead sputter not it seems that

00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:45,509
would not happen in the three Datuk

00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:49,779
series I think that's that's further out

00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:52,380
I believe that the state of the art

00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:56,019
right now is that dependent types are

00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,940
possible for the very courageous Scala

00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:59,890
has a version of dependent types which

00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,380
is not quite as powerful as some of the

00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,809
others systems that you see in in some

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,900
of the more advanced languages out there

00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:09,489
but I believe on that front we will stay

00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,979
pretty much on what we have for a while

00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:14,559
I think the next big thing to happen

00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:18,069
before dependent types is really effects

00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:19,949
so I expect something to happen on the

00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:22,150
effect site and once that is done and

00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:24,579
dependent types would be the next one

00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:27,969
after but we're really talking in terms

00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:30,699
of very very long periods only it's on

00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:32,969
the effects question so I mean of course

00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:37,319
I'm familiar with a previous proposal

00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:40,809
the effects with you know by implicit

00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:42,160
maybe I mean cuz I'm not sure you know

00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:44,469
I've heard you talk about research

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,910
before and I've heard you present these

00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:47,799
ideas it's a bunch of a bunch of

00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,539
researchers but I don't think anybody or

00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:51,009
very few people probably here have any

00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:53,170
clue what that even means so could you

00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:55,749
give like two sentence quick intro to

00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:58,269
what that what that is so so what again

00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:59,890
this is this is not not a release plan

00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:02,229
this is research that means we're going

00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,880
to try out things and we might be wrong

00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:06,670
in which case nothing will materialize

00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,410
but the the idea is to say instead of

00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:11,349
talking about effects we talk about

00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,150
capabilities so instead of saying

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:14,000
throwing an exception we say we talk

00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,599
about the cap

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,340
to throw an exception and we will model

00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,290
capabilities with a form of implicit

00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:24,830
parameters that's that's the gist of it

00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,750
and the advantage is that if we capture

00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:29,119
abstract over implicit parameters with

00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:32,119
implicit function types then we get very

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,160
nice properties algebraic properties of

00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,770
commutativity and subsetting that which

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,780
should really essentially make using

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,820
expressing effects much smoother than

00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:44,420
they were before that's the hope but we

00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:46,369
have to do it and try it out and then

00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,810
see whether we were right or wrong so

00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,220
the now mean like practically you'd you

00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,510
know you'd like implement a method which

00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,609
has a handful of these capabilities

00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:54,200
right like it has the capability does

00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:55,640
fro it has to capability to i/o or

00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,940
something capability to throw an

00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,359
exception things like that right right

00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:04,849
and and the the the trick is to say can

00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:07,250
throw and can do I always the same thing

00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,660
as can do I or in can throw whereas if

00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,460
you encode these things with type

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,950
constructors that's not true you have to

00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,930
sort of work very hard to swap the two

00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:17,869
constructors the other advantage is that

00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:20,180
you can get these capabilities over an

00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:22,220
arbitrary large scope so you do not have

00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:25,070
to go into each and every computation

00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,530
and essentially keep your constructors

00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:30,290
around and going to all the problems of

00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:33,140
essentially monads Freeman has finally

00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:35,060
tagless these things that I in the end

00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,470
all deal with this question that

00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,180
essentially you have a lot of type

00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:44,720
constructors in the way and you have to

00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:48,050
deal with them one way or another you

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,790
picked up the mic change your mind no I

00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,740
mean I was thinking more about like

00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:53,570
taking a step back and thinking you know

00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,180
about what is the type system for and

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:58,940
you know what what do we want it to do

00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:00,830
for you and you know I think of the type

00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,050
system as you know like the friend who

00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:07,400
like gently nudges you away from like

00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:07,880
cliffs and stuff and also doesn't stand

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,920
in your way

00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,359
when you want to do like mildly amusing

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,750
stuff that could be dangerous but

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,020
actually you know productive and so I

00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:20,210
think you know dependent types are cool

00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,670
there might be ways to to you know when

00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:25,010
you have like fuller dependency to to

00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,570
reason about you know that the term

00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,940
language up now is at your type your

00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:28,170
type

00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,970
but I think there's a real chance that

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:33,890
it just becomes too complicated and like

00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:37,410
bang for buck factor goes down too much

00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:38,700
and I think that's one of the things

00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,750
that I really like about Scala is the

00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,720
type system has found a good balance

00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:44,099
between just keeping you from shooting

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,119
yourself in the foot but still letting

00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,119
you you know do stuff

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:55,859
it's expresso some people are you're

00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,410
laughing in favor right okay I have

00:47:55,859 --> 00:48:00,150
another Wow someone keeps there's one

00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,289
keep popping on all the way up here can

00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,539
you actually like scroll a little bit

00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:06,630
yeah it's like trollee things kind of

00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:09,270
like I can't hide this really tired

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:13,460
I'm sorry I can't hide it it's so people

00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:15,869
don't troll him no I was really tired

00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,569
there's like four of these I just keep

00:48:15,869 --> 00:48:20,789
seeing these espresso ones please okay

00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:22,319
the real question this one really just

00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:25,819
keeps getting a bunch of votes wire case

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,819
class is not final in Scala three

00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,859
basically denims so if you want final

00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:41,130
case classes use an enum it's a simpler

00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:43,740
way as well and the turn in enums enum

00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,380
cases are final so that's the answer so

00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:48,270
we didn't feel that it was worthwhile to

00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,220
essentially introduce a new restriction

00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:54,440
that would break existing code including

00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,440
my code I use case classes

00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:03,500
so so why do I use case classes which

00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,530
are not final it's essentially because I

00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:09,530
want I want to do pattern in the

00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:13,400
compiler in the type structure I want to

00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:15,700
have the ability to pattern match on a

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,380
certain class of things and then have

00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,600
subclasses so if they have to be a case

00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,880
class and then have subclasses of them

00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,620
for implementation specific region a

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,300
reasons which nevertheless all

00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,100
essentially have the same pattern

00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,720
matching behavior so that's why I use

00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,650
the feature that case classes can in

00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:35,570
fact have subclasses okay so this is

00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,870
going to be the last question before we

00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:41,000
answer the infamous Trump blocky

00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:44,420
I mean that was a great great story

00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,890
Kelly I can't wait to hear more we have

00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,800
one more question before we get to that

00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:51,770
that juicy story I think I mean this

00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,250
one's pretty cool you know when I back

00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:58,130
when I started in like 2011 or 10 or

00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:00,470
something you know it was the JDM was

00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,120
funny right because yeah rather that JDK

00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:03,260
was hilariously slow and then all of a

00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,420
sudden of course we all know in the last

00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,920
several years development has really

00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:10,640
sped up and it's been really exciting to

00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:14,900
watch and you know you guys have kept up

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,890
with you know like like functions and

00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,550
all these other things being added to

00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:22,400
the JVM or I'm sorry to the JDK you know

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:25,880
we've watched Scala kind of follow suit

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:29,720
right and and you know update with with

00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,670
the JVM but updates to the JDK in JVM so

00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,200
the question is really you know what

00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,090
what next there's all these other cool

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,940
fancy things being added are we going to

00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:40,720
see some of these things changing house

00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,720
calibike 40c3

00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:08,810
I don't know I think Java eight is a

00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:12,680
great platform so we don't want this the

00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:14,060
world stories let's keep this one I

00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,859
don't know there's a few things that are

00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:19,250
cool in Java 11 and there's more coming

00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:20,960
I think we need a probably more

00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,450
compelling set of features before we

00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,060
would bump the required version of Java

00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,320
again I think more so than anything that

00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,230
was probably one of the bigger things

00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,599
that that that helped back spark Sparks

00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:33,829
upgrade because along with you know to

00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:35,300
spark the Java Scala

00:51:33,829 --> 00:51:38,210
ecosystem they had to upgrade their Java

00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,460
ecosystem as well so we don't we don't

00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,800
like upgrade to the require Java version

00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:47,210
lightly like you can like you know make

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:50,960
use of Java 11 features in in Scala 2 13

00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,520
and so on but I don't know I don't

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,800
currently don't see like a killer

00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:57,560
feature yet I mean if flume lands then

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,780
yes for sure but until that happens I

00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,250
don't really see too much that I'm very

00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,140
excited about I mean I like I'm mildly

00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,530
excited about a lot of things but not

00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,839
like make you guys upgrade your Chavez

00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:11,750
excited levels yeah that that's actually

00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:14,630
one of the main reasons why why we want

00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:16,880
tasty because with tasty we can actually

00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,920
cross will towards several a Java

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,839
version so that means we would we would

00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,670
be independent of that right now it's

00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:24,980
not practical you have to essentially

00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:28,990
diversion my matrix that would drive you

00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:32,060
crazy if you say Java 2.14 for Java 6

00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:34,069
and then and so on the whole matrix but

00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,140
with tasty you can actually be couple so

00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:37,910
you can convert an end times end problem

00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:46,040
to an end present problem which is much

00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:49,640
simpler ok cool so I think that we're

00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,150
finally on to the to the question of the

00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,849
evening

00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:54,650
Kelly you tell us more you're all gonna

00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:57,170
be very disappointed because the answer

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,329
is I don't know it was October of 2015

00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,940
if you want to look at my tweets from

00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:05,060
then I feel a little weird about telling

00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:06,619
you to do that but you tell me right I'm

00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,119
actually gonna hijack the stage though

00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:10,040
and talk about another question I saw

00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,630
getting votes or if it was how do we do

00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:15,900
deal with trolls in the scala community

00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:18,270
see that one that's amazing if I saw

00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,310
that when I would have stopped being

00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:21,990
 be kind to each other it's

00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,220
actually lucrative to be kind to each

00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,230
other and I don't know what motivates

00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,120
you but you can probably make more money

00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:36,540
if you're just a nice person that's my

00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:37,710
two cents amen thank you all right so

00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:40,080
with that I mean there's a million

00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,840
actually really cool questions I'm sorry

00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,670
that this came up so it so late like the

00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:48,630
ability to add your own cuz we didn't

00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:50,070
get to some of them so sorry but thanks

00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,320
for asking questions and of course

00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:55,710
thanks for thanks to all of the the

00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:58,260
panelists that have come up here and and

00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:00,570
told fun facts about themselves as well

00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,760
as all kinds of juicy interesting facts

00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,250
that we would like to know about you

00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,220
know mostly upcoming skala 3 so let's

00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:13,290
thank the panel

00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:13,290
[Applause]

00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,820
and and that that about wraps it up for

00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:23,490
force gala days there's one very

00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:26,250
important events after after this and

00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:30,150
that is the farewell cocktail which will

00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:33,150
go until 8 p.m. in the lobby here so you

00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:35,180
can hang out and chats and there might

00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,950
be snacks and there's definitely drinks

00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:40,560
you know and have a good time before

00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,510
before we all part ways there's a couple

00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,510
of other announcements and details so

00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:47,250
tomorrow is the type level summit it is

00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:49,650
not in this building in case you are

00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,800
planning to attend it is on the EPFL

00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,970
campus in the co building if you have no

00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,350
idea where that is it's best to just

00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:57,330
double check I just want to make sure

00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:59,240
you all know that you know people that

00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:01,860
are in this room do not come back here

00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:03,120
look online for the directions it's on

00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,610
it's on the campus it's across the

00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,720
street the building is called CEO but

00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,910
you'll figure it out as we check the

00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,600
website everything starts at 9 a.m.

00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:13,770
Oh lares has informed me that there will

00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,150
be stickers on the floor so you don't

00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:19,140
have to try that hard just do not come

00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:22,670
to this building ok the next thing is

00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:25,170
that there is an scholar user group

00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:27,570
organisers dinners so folks who have

00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:29,370
organized meetups and conferences and

00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:31,010
other things like this there's a little

00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:33,750
thank-you dinner for for those folks

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:35,430
there is a limited capacity and it's not

00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:39,060
exactly like you know an invite only

00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:40,770
thing you can come and and join if you'd

00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:42,240
like but like I said we at some point

00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:49,410
will reach capacity so we will not be

00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:52,410
able to bring everybody sponsored by

00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:56,340
tagging all sorry I was unaware of this

00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:59,220
detail so thank you and the if you if

00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:01,590
you plan on going to that just meet here

00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,380
in the lobby I think at 6:45 or 7:00

00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:06,300
there will be an announcement so you'll

00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,190
find us kind of standing over by the the

00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:12,540
information desk and people will walk

00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:14,070
over from here and I I believe those are

00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,020
all the remaining organizational details

00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:18,840
is that is there anything else miss okay

00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:22,070
so first now now that we're doing all

00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:24,060
the organizational details I I'd like to

00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,920
everybody well I have your attention

00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,569
please like

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,150
stand up and thank the organizers for

00:56:27,569 --> 00:56:34,740
doing such a wonderful job of putting

00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:38,069
this together so this is a lot of people

00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:41,339
it's not it's not just one person but of

00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:45,809
course it's Daria Jovanovic Diana Bonita

00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:48,900
and countless other folks from various

00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:51,390
companies including like Ben's EPFL laws

00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:55,380
on tourism and we've had several

00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:58,230
wonderful volunteers so thank you to all

00:56:55,380 --> 00:57:00,450
of you it was really an incredible Scala

00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:02,040
days I really felt a difference in sort

00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,079
of the community aspect of it it was

00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,460
really really exciting so thank you

00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,420
we'd also like to thank the sponsors of

00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,420
course because we wouldn't have all

00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,190
these cool social activities unless they

00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,109
they came and participated with us so

00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:15,540
let's thank the sponsors as well and
