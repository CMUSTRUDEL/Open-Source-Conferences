but you reviewed the first full request

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,989
I ever made it was a two line full

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,739
request and I had two typos in it and it

00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,660
was a complete disaster

00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:04,229
but your your your contributions are so

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,240
numerous and arrived so rapidly that

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,000
it's really hard for me to understand
