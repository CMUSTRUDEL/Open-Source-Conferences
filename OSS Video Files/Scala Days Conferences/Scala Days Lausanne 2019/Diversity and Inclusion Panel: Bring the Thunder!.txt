of Scala days this is our diversity and

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,670
inclusion panel you're probably not in

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,939
the wrong room it's the only session

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,470
running right now which is really

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,359
fantastic thanks to all the organizers

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,310
who made this happen because we're

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,689
incredibly excited to bring this to you

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,179
today

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,510
my name is Susheela Sahai I've been with

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,050
light Bend for seven years and I've been

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,059
managing all the groups that are

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:43,020
responsible for customer and employee

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:46,440
success at the company you know as a

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,469
minority female who's been in technology

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,820
for more years and I like to admit over

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,860
about thirty let's say diversity and

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,620
inclusion have been a big part of my

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,989
life and my thinking process throughout

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,860
from childhood and some of the most

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,860
insightful conversations I've had

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:11,369
recently especially are with these folks

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,180
on this panel and so it is my privilege

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,700
to bring this panel to you and I really

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,470
hope you guys enjoy the conversation you

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,280
can participate in the conversation by

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,330
going to slide Oh comm and entering the

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,430
code respect with a capital R and asking

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,909
questions so we will have a time set

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,939
aside for a Q&A I think on behalf of all

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,750
of us you know we believe that change is

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,090
based on awareness understanding empathy

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,710
and that will develop those qualities

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,350
and continue to develop for those

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,240
qualities with open conversation open

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,200
dialogue and confronting the challenges

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,930
that do exist so once again my privilege

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,060
to welcome you guys immense gratitude

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,460
for what you're about to do it takes a

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,170
lot of courage so more power to you

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,170
turning it over to you Mike

00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:12,060
Wow fantastic introduction thank you so

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,240
so I am privileged to moderate this

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,770
panel today and just as an introduction

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,560
to myself my name is Mike Callen

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,580
i am the vp of professional services for

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,010
life end and it's my pleasure to be up

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,560
here to learn from the members of the

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,510
panel and to build my own awareness and

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,700
empathy on behalf of the audience and so

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,230
that's really why I'm here I'd like to

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,680
get our panel to introduce themselves

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:41,280
and maybe just to start us off give us

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,430
an idea of why inclusion is important to

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,970
you in the environments you work in

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,860
thanks Mike

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,230
my name is Tara Hernandez I am an

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,120
engineering manager at Google cloud i'm

00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,030
also an advisory board member of women

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,490
who code which is a worldwide non-profit

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,410
supporting women in tech i think we have

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,620
some swiss chapters I'll have to look

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,440
that up yes awesome

00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,520
diversity is really important to me for

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,340
very practical reasons the changing

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,450
demographics in the United States

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:16,050
certainly is where my focus has been but

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,360
in general in the world mean that we

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,060
need to be aware of the differences of

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,030
people coming in who can impact

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,160
individual companies in a positive way

00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,310
not focusing on what those are is been

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,600
proven in many studies that are emerging

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,150
that companies that are more diverse are

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,090
more successful certainly from a you

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,150
know employee pool where you can hire or

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,160
from your customer base being to sort of

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,160
homogenized in how we approach high-tech

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,580
industry is is makes less sense as the

00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,580
years go on

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,989
great yeah my name is Kiki Carter I'm a

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,530
Global Solutions Architect with white

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:57,150
bent and why I feel inclusion is

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,220
important it echos a little bit of what

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,450
Tara said I mean it's very practical

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,130
actually to have a diverse workforce not

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,510
only because you have a diversity of

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,390
ideas but you have a diversity of

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,950
experience and real experiences that

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,890
people have had around the world and

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,350
those experiences themselves lend into

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,510
the solutions that people are creating I

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,780
mean everything that we're doing whether

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,780
it's

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,600
architecture whatever you're working on

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,280
it's all for the purpose of solving

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,680
specific solutions and usually those

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,350
solutions are around marketing to people

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,780
or consumerism or healthcare or things

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,420
like that and you have a very diverse

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,930
pool of people in the real world so

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,060
having that knowledge to bring to your

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,250
solutions becomes very important and

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:52,950
practically why companies who focus on

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:59,940
this are more successful so the llama is

00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:01,950
officially named Arianna first really

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,230
thank you for asking me to be on this

00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,790
panel I still have no idea why but I'm

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,150
going to try them try my best and as

00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,310
everybody knows here I'm exhausted from

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,830
the last week so I have some notes and

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,810
don't mind if I if I sometimes I look at

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,320
them so to introduce myself

00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,100
Heather helped me do this so bear with

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,020
me I'm running the communications and

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,930
community and communication side of this

00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,700
kava Center and my goal in this role is

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,640
to build a stronger more connected and

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,020
more inclusive Scala community now what

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,670
I heard here you were asking wise in

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,100
yeah what is why is inclusivity

00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,510
important and then you pick up the

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,730
answer and you started speaking about

00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,490
diversity and then somehow you spoke

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,850
about diversity and inclusivity and then

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:54,150
I would like to end this round by saying

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:59,610
the diversity is effect on the planet

00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:02,520
whether it's gender culture point in

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,490
life point of view I mean diversity

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,260
which is that's that's where we live an

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,410
inclusivity something that I'm focusing

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:14,910
on in my work and what we are going to

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:17,250
speak later on maybe immediately is how

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,460
I integrated all the feedback and

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,380
working with diverse people and how I

00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:24,480
included their feedback in Scouting that

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:44,310
we are having today absolutely yeah so

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:46,860
that's gonna be a great topic and the

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,100
and really I think you know one of the

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,560
biggest reasons inclusion in the

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,880
workplace is important to me is it's

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,630
important for everybody have the same

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,919
opportunities and fair treatment right

00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,720
everybody needs to be on a level playing

00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,370
field from that regard and I think

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,540
that's something that people are still

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,990
trying to figure out how to do effective

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:09,780
it but once you kind of get your head

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,720
into rights-based of you know how to how

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,100
to be inclusive and how to deal with and

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,169
appreciate the diversity in the

00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,520
workforce you're gonna get you know a

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,110
company is gonna work better right

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,030
you've got a lot a lot of rich

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,610
experiences that people are bringing to

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:25,260
the table and by making sure these

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,380
people are included in the conversation

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,419
when appreciated then your company is

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,090
just going to be better from that you

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,780
know from that standpoint too so it's

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,340
there's a number of different reasons

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,090
but I hope that kind of summarizes why

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,979
for me absolutely yeah and how its thank

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,260
you so much for joining us I know that

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,790
you couldn't be here in person but being

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:50,460
here like this is fantastic thank you

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,300
alright so I was gonna ask and I feel

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,680
like we've actually answered this

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,110
question pretty well but if you guys

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,460
have anything more to add on this you

00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,200
know organizations as a whole and the

00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,450
organizations we work in and we play in

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,729
and everything like that there are some

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,979
real concrete benefits to having an

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:06,210
inclusive culture that nurtures

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,100
diversity

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,290
do you guys have any more sort of

00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,000
thoughts on on why is that so critical

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,919
because I think one of the things for me

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,260
and for the audience and you know in

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,590
general we need to think about is this

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,270
isn't just a nice thing to do right this

00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:23,789
is a necessary thing in a lot of cases

00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,990
and it's something that will be more

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:29,789
competitive will be will be better off

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,680
certainly there's a ton of examples of

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,719
we're failing to have some kind of

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
diversity within your workforce has been

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,969
fairly catastrophic um one of my

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,589
favorites is the racist soap dispensers

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,089
if you go into YouTube and you search

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,500
for racist soap dispensers you'll see

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,350
this poor guy I think he's from nature

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,520
and he's in a bathroom and he keeps

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,320
sticking his hand under the soap

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,570
dispenser and it won't give him any soap

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,580
and his friend comes over in six his

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,530
hand under and it works just great he

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,950
ends up having to put a white towel on

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,390
his hand and now he will get soap right

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,520
I mean that's the most ridiculous thing

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,170
ever if you had one dark-skinned person

00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:10,500
I think so Sheila said she ran into the

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:12,600
same problem so watch out three another

00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,070
one that is is pretty awesome as I

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,850
worked at a company that did a lot of

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:23,760
graphics and and focus on VR it turns

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:26,040
out that you know oculus and H HG see

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,410
that whatever the two big big companies

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,060
are I don't think either of them really

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,070
had any women on their Hardware teams

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,050
because if they had they probably would

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,300
have discovered what was discovered

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,160
after the hardware was released that as

00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,590
many as seventy eight percent of women

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,880
get motion sickness in the current

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:49,140
designs so in the United States alone

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,740
which is 51% female which was the main

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,300
market that is a huge segment of

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,500
potential customer base that you've just

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,850
eliminated because they're gonna throw

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,200
up if they use your product right so

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,090
these are the kinds of things that it

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,400
would be really helpful if you had some

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,200
kind of variety on your teams and we

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,150
could probably sit here and go many

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,490
other examples but those are two of my

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,140
favorite and it just you know again

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,810
going back to yes it is the right thing

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,220
to do we should all be respectful and

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,720
supportive of each other we all have a

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,670
lot of really good things to bring but

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,250
it's also a really practical thing to do

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:26,040
we need to not be having our heads in

00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,860
the sand that we all think alike or

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,160
react in the same ways so even from from

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,900
a very concrete outbound to the customer

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,280
perspective like this is this is

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:41,640
impacting absolutely the market yeah

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,920
that's what oh my gosh yeah do you did

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,960
you want anything to the to to how

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,460
organizations are gonna benefit or or

00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,170
maybe how they're not you know they're

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,430
gonna fail if they don't absolutely I

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,070
mean there there is the thing that

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,590
you'll fail if you don't yeah and and

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,089
maybe that is an okay thing right maybe

00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,800
we're creating maybe the

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:02,970
world itself is creating a place where

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,550
your your your market share or your

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:08,459
success in business is going to depend

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,819
on you being able to be not only aware

00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,100
of the the changing global space but

00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,350
being able to operate in that space and

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,629
take advantage of that space so maybe I

00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,879
mean it is going to either weed people

00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:24,059
out who haven't taken those steps or

00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:27,329
caused another type of tension that we

00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:30,149
may need in order to see certain shifts

00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:32,550
and change in the world I mean yes it is

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:35,490
the right thing to do for various

00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:38,910
reasons but it's also maybe it's going

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,170
to play into capitalism which you know

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,689
if you're just trying to be successful

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,670
with that or any other type of

00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:49,860
consumerism you want to be successful

00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:51,720
with it's possible yep you work in an

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,449
organization that is a nonprofit right

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,670
like and so we're not talking so much

00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:59,430
about you know making a profit or not

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,949
but the success factors I mean how does

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,569
how does inclusion and diversity affect

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,029
your success factors in a nonprofit

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:08,519
environment this is a super complex

00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:11,100
topic but I'm going to try to fit it in

00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,199
in like a minute or two so one thing

00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,600
that I really like the fact that I'm

00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:22,019
going a bit later because I can just add

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:25,339
my little stone so in my case the team

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,480
that I have around me is not really my

00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,829
first team because it there are

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,089
engineers and I'm working with the

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:37,470
community so my team is again I'm back

00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:40,259
to the point my team is very diverse

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,360
people around the world that I cannot

00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,279
control or influence there is no

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,899
mechanism there so when we are speaking

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,259
about companies there is a-there

00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:52,860
mechanisms there you have administrative

00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,920
part you have HR your finances boss

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,629
decent that so you have you can actually

00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,550
have some kind of a thought in those

00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:01,230
processes that could make a change

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,549
because there is a reason to make a

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,320
change in this case I found in the last

00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:11,649
two years that my job is literally truly

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,009
and not to let any part of the community

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:17,560
get too frustrated by not being hurt and

00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:22,420
reacted to this is really something that

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:26,589
that is my learning is and brings me two

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:29,050
Scotties it's um it's just how do you

00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,970
this is what I'm still in the process of

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,660
thinking and working on it and learning

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:37,029
a lot especially since this morning's

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,170
keynote Bogdan vassilis quite enough

00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:42,670
using the houses I learned and this is

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,639
what I would like to quote and he also

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:52,019
like product picture and the picture is

00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:55,300
phenomenal the photo how if you make a

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:59,019
progress for one group you include one

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,949
minority it actually brings in more

00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:06,009
people so he had this photo on which you

00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:08,680
have a person with a wheelchair crossing

00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,959
the street and like on the on the ramp

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,589
and then after that you have people with

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,449
the suitcases deliverers you know and

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:18,940
then you see all these other wheels that

00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:24,579
can also benefit from it so when you're

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:28,300
listening to a piece of a segment of a

00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:31,240
group that has something to say why not

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:34,209
react I just that's my so I am just

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,949
privileged that my reactions back to the

00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:39,550
feedback are still in the virtual world

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:43,720
and then just sometimes we get together

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:45,550
and why not have fun and so it's almost

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,190
that it's accretive right like if we

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,410
start with down the right path then it

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,689
gives us the pathways for all the other

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,850
people to come along as well right and

00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,189
and there's you know one plus one equals

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,329
three in a way and how that goes okay

00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,149
awesome

00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:03,069
how about you from from your perspective

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:04,870
you know from an organizational

00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,589
perspective why is why is diversity

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:11,920
inclusion is such a critical thing sure

00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:13,060
so really I think I just want to talk

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,680
about one of the points that Kiki

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,230
brought up and she brought up a great

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,510
point about you know in the world

00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,269
marketplace and I mean if you can't be

00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,769
diverse with the people you work with

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,220
if you can't understand what they need

00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:29,350
and what drives them then how can you

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,230
possibly compete in the world you know

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,389
it's it's it's it's no charity begins at

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,480
home kind of thing it's if it's it's

00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:40,899
it's super important to be able to you

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,740
know make sure you're putting on the

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:44,529
right

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,759
I guess face to the world you know be

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,379
making sure that you actually do

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,149
understand that the issues people are

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,449
running into and that you can build

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,220
products and and whatnot that actually

00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,749
help them address those kind of issues

00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,579
make sure you're targeting things

00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,410
correctly so I'm a pretty business

00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:01,809
standpoint I think it makes total sense

00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,730
but no I've seen that as Daria we're

00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:05,769
saying you know you the more people that

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,329
get involved it's a snowball effect

00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:16,149
you know it's building consensus almost

00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:18,329
magically awesome to your point which is

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,699
inclusion in the concept of open source

00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:23,949
in Google Cloud you know we have a ton

00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:27,100
of open source offerings kubernetes is

00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:29,079
is one obviously Android chromium one of

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,610
the challenges that from an open source

00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,689
perspective is also one of language

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,129
right English for good or ill is sort of

00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:37,779
the language of tech now that works out

00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:40,779
well for me because I can at least sort

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,279
of speak English but as we're here in a

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,439
country where everyone speaks at least

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,509
five languages I think it's very

00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:49,509
intimidating but it's also you know I

00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:51,579
think there's a billion people who speak

00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,839
Mandarin in some small percentage that

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,699
might speak English there's another

00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,470
billion people who speak Spanish some

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,499
small percentage that might speak

00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,600
English there's a whole wealth of

00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:04,209
emerging education systems that are

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,819
supporting those communities that aren't

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,760
really able to contribute to these

00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:12,459
products and that's we're missing out so

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,829
localization is another aspect of

00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:17,010
inclusion that I think particularly for

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,390
you know any any repository and github

00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,159
being able to localize at least the

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,799
developer Docs for that could be a whole

00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:26,079
new way of really inviting more people

00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:28,929
to come in our open-source communities

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,240
so it's it's very wide it's more than

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:32,889
just people of color or gender or

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,970
religion it's there are so many

00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,140
different ways that you could look at

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,270
diversity and inclusion

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,299
so I've heard it said once that if you

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,190
want the top three percent of the most

00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:43,809
competent people in the world you know

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,030
working on your project or working in

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,820
your company or whatever if you

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,470
artificially limit the total pool you

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,360
know you get you don't actually have

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,860
access to that that top three percent of

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,090
people right that's kind of what what

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,880
you're sort of leading to here is like

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:59,530
we have to be inviting in order to get

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,330
all of the talent that we want that's

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,530
exactly what we're doing right that's

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,820
awesome

00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:09,250
thank you so this event I think it's

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,320
been an amazing event and it's it's gone

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,429
so well and you know I know

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,960
dharia have been running around like

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:15,520
crazy but I think I don't think

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,120
anybody's noticed I think it's been

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,760
amazing and and you've worked really

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,980
hard to to make it and inviting an

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,290
inclusive event that fosters that

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,360
diversity and bringing people in so walk

00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,530
us through the process of that and in

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,530
how the hell this all came together

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,419
thank you for your question and thank

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,370
you for your comments and thank you

00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:47,200
everyone that approached me and well

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,090
actually thank you for everyone that you

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,090
are enjoying because the first thing I

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,610
said on this stage was please enjoy and

00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:57,220
I think we drop the mic last night when

00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:00,280
there was like dance-off on the floor at

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,470
the community dinner and it was just

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,200
fantastic it was really for me that was

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,090
I knew that if I died there and then

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,510
because I could not breathe anymore like

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:15,549
just don't don't wake me up I can go so

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,220
basically last year for the last year's

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,510
holidays I was part of the program

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,150
committee as a manager of program

00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:23,919
committee and as such I didn't have too

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:27,070
many responsibilities which gave me a

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:30,309
very comfortable space to observe so I

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:32,740
was somewhat associated so people would

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:34,990
come and tell me things but I was not

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,679
super responsible so I could not do many

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:43,080
much things for the particular event and

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:46,360
from that feedback that I gathered

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,669
Skol days emerged this year and what

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,980
I've heard and what is integrated and

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:52,280
the

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,020
is not a total of what can be and

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,780
hopefully everybody again can come with

00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:01,010
their stones and continue the snowball

00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:03,679
effect I'm going to list those

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,419
particular things that were happening

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,190
around college because I'm not sure if

00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:10,010
everybody really knows all the things

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,850
that were happening around but before I

00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,890
dive into the concrete points I would

00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,049
just like to say that comfort that now I

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,120
learned and I have a new found

00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:24,530
appreciation of conference organizers

00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:28,640
meetup organizers chat room moderators

00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:31,540
like there is like a sea of people that

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,760
are doing something that I did this year

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,770
because they are trying like to

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,440
translate this diversity into

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,270
inclusiveness that is materializing with

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,280
people in a in a certain room and it's

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,130
not everytime easy especially if you're

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,630
doing an event in Switzerland who can

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,450
come to Switzerland who can stay in

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,640
Switzerland who can you know so on and

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,490
so on I'm not going to go further than

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,340
that so with that said I'm going to dive

00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,740
into what we did this year to make the

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,169
most inclusive event we could with cards

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,059
that we had and to translate like all

00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:09,230
the people that I'm speaking online

00:21:05,059 --> 00:21:11,900
actually could come hopefully here so

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,600
first we will partnered with EPFL which

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,549
means that many of the events we were

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,530
doing around and that were free and even

00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:21,290
the workshops that were not free we're

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:25,610
done at EPFL so we could use the

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:28,120
premises with subsidized or or fee which

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,830
then allowed us to lower the prices

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:36,320
comparing to other holidays for about

00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:38,600
25% we this year we had the student

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,910
prices which is not new and I need to

00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,240
say this really wants more I'm standing

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:47,150
on the shoulders of giants nothing would

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,190
happen if there was not trust building

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:52,429
over nine years and this is when I start

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:56,750
crying so I should better focus on my

00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:58,730
point but yeah I mean I got to a point

00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,880
where there was just a little push

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,980
needed to do this this is all your work

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,130
from white man to try fort Indiana

00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,169
especially to each every individual so

00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,650
what I'm doing this is literally a

00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:15,740
cherry on the cake so student price is

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,710
available that's not new but it was free

00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,960
daycare was new during the conference

00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:24,110
which turned out to be a super nice

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,799
success and we have about eight or nine

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:29,360
babies and toddlers just running around

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,350
which brings me to the point of

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,350
accompanying person option for partners

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:38,900
that are traveling and on top of that we

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,240
organized a couple of Tours in vineyards

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,950
and in the city so the partners can they

00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,409
can eat here they can go for tour so

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:50,750
they actually can experience the city or

00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:54,110
the region actually then we dedicated

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:56,120
diversity scholarships about twenty

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:59,750
tickets but it was actually more closer

00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:03,610
to forty with travel budget assigned and

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,610
accommodation and so forth and we did it

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,140
with the Scala user group organizes

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:12,110
around the world so we reached out to

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,620
them so they can also directly reach to

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:18,049
their communities and either raffle on

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,970
the Scala bridge or on different type of

00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:21,559
things that they are doing and we were

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,650
speaking with each and every sponsor

00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:26,539
which we have about 25 sponsors to do to

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,799
encourage them to do the same similar

00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:34,190
whatever they could do so we were very

00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:36,169
vocal about that then we also had free

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,820
education surrounding events so even if

00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:39,409
you could not come to the conference

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,270
which is very educational but in the end

00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:44,210
it's going to be on YouTube so I mean

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,370
you don't really need to be here but at

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:48,140
the events I mean you're just seeing as

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,240
you cannot communicate with us on stage

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,820
but on these events in these events

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,070
there were three major ones you can

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,530
actually speak and work and learn and

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,600
contribute with the actual authors and

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:02,750
so on so that was the one that should

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,190
have been paid but yeah so that that's

00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,860
that was happening on Monday and Tuesday

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,860
during that collocating with type level

00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,990
summit and finally having a community

00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,669
dinner yesterday in the one-and-only

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:15,510
olympic museum which I don't know if

00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:18,030
many people here understood

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,940
so that there was a point yes it's a

00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:24,240
beautiful venue beautiful space we love

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,400
it all but Olympics stand for very

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,230
certain values of excellence respect and

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,020
friendship so that's why the community

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:33,540
dinner was actually there because there

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:37,260
was a thought behind it on top of the

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:40,020
beauty of it and this was the message

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,910
for the community I mean this is what

00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,440
the the values that we support and we

00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,050
should always have in mind

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,090
and the final point and then I have to

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,860
give you the time is that there my

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,290
favorite part of all of that is

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,230
volunteers my volunteers that we are in

00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:59,000
the house let's please one round of

00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,000
applause for just four volunteers

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,880
it took about I would say three months

00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,650
of building the relationship with

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,170
volunteers and finally onboarding them

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,970
on Sunday so they can do the job that

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,340
they're doing and solve problems as

00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,220
they're solving I Diana and I literally

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:25,290
multiplied our selves in in 20 people

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:30,240
and we I mean it's just amazing and the

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:32,670
group of volunteers are diverse in a

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,930
group of people coming from all sides of

00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,230
the world and all sides of the

00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:40,410
background backgrounds and everything so

00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:43,410
this is this is what I just had to tell

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:46,260
about the event and what I was hearing

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:48,690
is translated to this into this with a

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,540
huge and enormous help and advice from

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:55,800
Diana who is like we were one dragon

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:59,640
with two heads basically but yeah the

00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,790
concept it was was that this is what we

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,560
have today that's awesome and looking at

00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,870
it compared to previous years have we

00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:09,570
have do you feel like this is has really

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,030
brought in a more sort of diverse

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,740
audience to to the conference and I

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,600
actually have a data point we had a

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,730
diversity inclusion lunch yesterday

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,530
organized by zalando uh-huh

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:21,420
which I was supposed to communicate a

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,030
long time ago and then I forgot and then

00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:28,470
I did it yesterday morning for lunch and

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:29,010
I was like if we get 20 people yeah it's

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,570
a success

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:36,510
that's a measure of success and how many

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:38,910
did we have 84 84 people Wow right on we

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,520
ordered food for 60 yeah we're like we

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:45,030
were aiming high back in the day but we

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:48,510
even and another point of data point is

00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,820
when I go to the ladies bathroom the

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,070
doors are opening and closing opening

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,520
and closing

00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:58,460
it's called Daisy

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,460
[Laughter]

00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:12,060
way to go that's great Cheers thank you

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:14,430
all right so so we're here we're at an

00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,500
inclusive event and we're having a panel

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,990
on inclusive inclusivity and diversity

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,490
it's fantastic this is this is wonderful

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,320
so holla

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,920
I'd love to talk to you a little bit

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,300
about your experience I think that yeah

00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,890
you know you might actually have to

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:32,940
explain this because seeing you over

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:37,440
zoom here you know we don't actually we

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,270
can't actually tell which sort of you

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,960
know underrepresented group you actually

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,790
are part of so and and I think that that

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,560
is there's a sort of a level of

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,030
invisibility around that that I'd love

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,960
for you to help us to sort of make

00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:54,390
visible to the audience here sure so um

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,700
thank you so yeah I should I should have

00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,800
one of those you know little mobility

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,330
things that they have been the Big Bang

00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,530
Theory where I can have a screen and

00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:09,300
drive around the stage or something but

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:11,370
yeah so I guess my the the part of the

00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:17,640
conversation I represent is is invisible

00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:20,280
disabilities and the this started a

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,740
number of years ago but for me but no

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,690
over the last 7 years since I've been at

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,530
light Bend it's it's something that's

00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:30,450
progressed quite quite quite rapidly for

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:34,410
me so where I am today is quite

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:37,730
different from where I started and you

00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:40,710
know having a physical disability is

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,970
it's it's difficult for the person who's

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,320
in that position but it's even more

00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,960
difficult the people you work with

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,580
because how do you deal with that how do

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,570
you how do you help somebody who's just

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:57,669
kind of I guess fading away over time

00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:02,110
for one of a better word and it's it's

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:03,669
tough and you know you can't there's

00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,510
there's no prescription for it for

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:06,669
dealing with something like this

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:08,890
obviously no today you know if I try to

00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:11,890
stand up yes you'd see you know that I

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,270
have something wrong so to speak but you

00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,460
know there are many other types of

00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,049
physical invisible disabilities like

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,169
depression and things like that so

00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:24,130
there's no recipe for helping people in

00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:26,260
that kind of situation so so I really

00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,409
believe that instead of trying to fix

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,390
the problem and trying to be you know as

00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:33,190
included no go overboard on inclusivity

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,610
it's just really kind of approach things

00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:40,000
with empathy right this is this is

00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:43,870
something that really was was drilled

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:49,510
into me a few years ago now by one of my

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:51,760
co-workers and he I could tell you know

00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,890
that he had something to say or

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,659
something to to talk about further for a

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,799
little while but he kind of bided his

00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:03,490
time and watched into the back and when

00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,289
they just asked me to coffee and know no

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,760
other reason and let's go grab a cup of

00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:10,659
coffee so we went ahead a cup of coffee

00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,000
and you just kind of naturally had a

00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:14,860
conversation about well hey is he you've

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,960
got some you know got some problems you

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,919
can see if God said no if it's hard for

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,270
you to do some things and it was a was

00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:29,530
actually a wonderful experience because

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:34,179
I'd never imagined you know that anybody

00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:36,659
would approach me like that and actually

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:40,750
makes me teary-eyed to talk about but um

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:43,059
but the point is is that you know had

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,760
that not happened I wouldn't be in the

00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:48,460
place to I am today to Josh you want to

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,760
talk about this I've got a whole ton of

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:55,510
things to talk about you know so but but

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,320
the thing is is that is is really you

00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,960
know some

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,120
be with with a disability and a growing

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,539
disability know there's there's there's

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:07,269
things for me that might seem very very

00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:09,340
minor to others but by taking that

00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:11,139
approach of just talking to me and just

00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,029
you know saying well hey how can I help

00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:14,380
you know is there something that can

00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:17,620
help with know

00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,419
are you comfortable asking you if

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,399
there's something I can help with you

00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:23,500
know it's it was just a great approach

00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:25,929
and no I don't have monopolize the

00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:28,389
four-year but but one thing is that you

00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:31,210
know when people have can only speak for

00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:33,820
myself but it's but you know when people

00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:39,129
have disabilities oftentimes you know

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:40,929
it's it's not actual help doing

00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:44,259
something that people are looking for

00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:46,330
it's just an understanding so any you

00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:48,429
know so if I go grab a cup of coffee you

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,899
know so it's quite a ways to walk from

00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:54,190
the kitchen in our San Francisco office

00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:56,379
to my office and you know it's yeah I

00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:59,649
walk kind of funny and if somebody

00:31:56,379 --> 00:32:02,230
helped me or try to help me do that

00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,029
then well you know I'm competitive so no

00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,470
I don't need your help this game on I'm

00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:08,679
gonna get to my office and I don't care

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:13,090
how much this coffee I'm gonna spill the

00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,769
process so you know it's um so like I

00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,779
said talking about it rather than

00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:22,169
directly trying to reach out and help

00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:24,789
blindly I guess it is was big for me so

00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:26,710
as I said it's different for everybody

00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:29,080
but I think you know if you approach

00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,610
things from an empathetic standpoint you

00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,620
can't go wrong right

00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:34,179
I really equate you're saying there how

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,809
in terms of it's different for everybody

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:40,450
right which is which is really powerful

00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:42,429
I think right it's it's the individual

00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,100
we're talking about people we're not

00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:47,529
talking about you know situations or

00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,409
conditions or it's people people to

00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:53,620
people right yeah exactly

00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:55,419
yeah and it was the it was like I said

00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:59,649
it was the simplest thing just a simple

00:32:55,419 --> 00:33:01,809
conversation but meant so much yeah

00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:03,669
that's amazing thank you for sharing

00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:06,460
that very much I'll and I think you know

00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:08,100
for for me and for us I mean on the

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,879
audience and and everything

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,269
understanding a little bit of that and

00:33:09,879 --> 00:33:13,349
sort

00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:15,639
getting a sense for it in terms of

00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:17,200
building some of that empathy it's

00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,849
really helpful and powerful so thank

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,519
thank you for sharing that very much huh

00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:26,019
really appreciate it

00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:27,729
doors so Kiki I mean just you know

00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:30,519
there's there's invisible disabilities

00:33:27,729 --> 00:33:33,369
there's and things like that but there's

00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:36,909
also you know I think there's a systemic

00:33:33,369 --> 00:33:40,359
sort of invisibility to the experience

00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:41,950
of people in underrepresented groups and

00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:45,219
people of color especially in things

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,289
like that that oftentimes we don't I say

00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:50,440
it's invisible because we don't feel it

00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:51,549
right we don't live that experience can

00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,959
you talk us through some of that and

00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:54,039
some of that experience and help share

00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,629
with the audience some of the empathy on

00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,609
that side of things yeah sure and I

00:33:55,629 --> 00:34:00,639
think it's really important that I'll

00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:02,769
use the word empathy because I would

00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:04,749
like to challenge this idea that you

00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:06,969
don't experience it or don't feel it

00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:09,520
because there are many times I go into

00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:11,980
you know I travel to many countries and

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,089
different places and I'm sure you you

00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,309
yourself have traveling to a country

00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,559
where and been in standing somewhere

00:34:15,309 --> 00:34:20,619
where you're the only American or where

00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,319
you're the only I mean Canadian or North

00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:28,179
American right but the favored state oh

00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:30,099
come on now and or you've you've been

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,049
somewhere where you you've been the only

00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:33,819
person there's no one here who can say

00:34:32,049 --> 00:34:35,049
they've not been somewhere we've been

00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:37,240
the only person mm-hmm

00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:40,179
and so you know how it feels to be the

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,549
only whoever you are somewhere you felt

00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:45,279
it but the thing is you for you it's

00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:47,260
just a temporary thing yeah yeah you

00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:49,329
know you're going home you know you're

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,399
going back to your place you know you're

00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,990
going to your comfort zone and your

00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,829
comfort zone just doesn't it doesn't

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:59,020
leave right and so you have that

00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:01,470
experience and then you shed it when you

00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,819
get back oof good glad that's over

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,630
you know I've seen it myself I'm you

00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:10,390
know I've you know I've worked in and

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,789
Malawi and other countries and I've

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,740
worked with white Americans who've gone

00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,569
there and I'm like oh my god I was so

00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,180
glad when we got back and I could see

00:35:16,569 --> 00:35:21,549
another white person and like wow like

00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:23,410
you see how that feels that's it's kind

00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:24,130
of hard to be the only one in a place

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,299
right

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:30,130
it feels some way and so to imagine that

00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:32,349
you don't have to have that empathy

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,640
anymore and understand like to see

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:37,359
people walk away from that type of

00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:40,180
experience and then shed it and not let

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,339
it grow them to see that other people

00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,289
have that experience of you know not

00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:46,539
being the English speaker in the room or

00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:49,569
not being the most eloquent person or or

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:51,099
not being someone who can who can run 50

00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:54,700
miles when everyone's like hey everybody

00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:56,470
let's go running you know it's you just

00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,910
forget it and I think it's a willful

00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:00,369
selfishness mmm

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:03,339
and a willful ignoring I don't I don't

00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,799
think that it's accidental or you know

00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:07,450
oh I didn't know what to do well if you

00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,640
could reach back to a time where you

00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,900
felt like you were isolated then maybe

00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,299
you wouldn't know what to do the first

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,710
thing being that oh I should recognize

00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:18,150
that other people are having this

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:21,910
experience around me right now right I

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:24,880
mean that's just one simple one simple

00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:27,160
thing with it so building empathy for

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,140
that experience and you had a cap trip

00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,729
absolutely capturing those experiences

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,130
and not shedding it when you leave I

00:36:30,729 --> 00:36:34,960
whoa wow that's over and then

00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,029
understanding that you walk into a room

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,680
and there are other people someone right

00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:41,229
beside you who may be experiencing that

00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,450
yeah that's a fascinating point actually

00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:44,349
I mean I've never I've honestly never

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,989
thought of it that way

00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:53,140
I really haven't hopefully other people

00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:58,779
will yeah so in that and mean in that

00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:02,529
experience I mean it's almost a matter

00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:05,140
of of saying of reaching in and and

00:37:02,529 --> 00:37:07,089
trying to reach back out to people with

00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,400
with the sense of that and being able to

00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:12,759
say hey like I can see you're in a

00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,039
situation where where I once was or I'm

00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:17,289
temporarily been rather and and come

00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:19,239
back out and try to try to channel that

00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:21,190
feeling right well sure a channeling the

00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:23,440
the empathy that you'd get from that and

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,390
you know as we're talking about growing

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,089
a community here this is Scala community

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,119
is is you know they're developers we

00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:33,150
have we work for companies or nonprofits

00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,650
taking that into those environments and

00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,250
understanding that people are feeling

00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,710
isolated and that's why we

00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:41,570
is where inclusion it's not about you

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,040
know we need some quotas and we need to

00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,350
have this person in that person of blah

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,160
blah blah it's about removing those

00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:50,870
barriers of isolation and in helping

00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,940
people understand you see them not

00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,520
making everyone the same yeah it's not

00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,290
that oh then we're only gonna do things

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,780
that everyone wants to do or we're only

00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,300
gonna do all the same things and and you

00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:04,610
know things like that it's just that

00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:06,530
making sure that you're aware about

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,050
people about doing things that are

00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:12,530
intentionally isolating to people and

00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:15,770
not having options for other people I

00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:18,170
mean just like having childcare imagine

00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:20,810
how many people who have children or

00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,970
families who you know one of the many

00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:25,400
reasons why women follow the workforce

00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:27,920
is because at least in where where I

00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,270
live having childcare is difficult so

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,700
you think about it before you like man

00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,770
that's a big deal if I'm gonna you know

00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:38,000
house it's gonna destroy my career if I

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,710
if I have a kid right to that point

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,060
which is excellent point I don't have

00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:45,230
you sell it so I don't need to own a

00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:47,000
place again but the daycare for example

00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,620
and I was saying all these fantastic

00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,880
things that we did but again we're in

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,820
Switzerland so we can do fantastic

00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,400
things being aware meaning if you're

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,230
organizing a conference and you want to

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,480
be inclusive you can say we would love

00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:02,330
to do a daycare this is the reason we

00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,760
cannot respond sir is that or we cannot

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:07,610
we are limited in these ways being aware

00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,070
and saying I'm aware it's already enough

00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:12,410
you don't have to have a daycare to be

00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:15,890
inclusive so that is that is the point

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:19,040
that I would like to like underline 15

00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:21,140
times you say this is what we think is

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,060
an inclusive conference this is what we

00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:25,400
can afford these things we cannot afford

00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:27,320
either somebody help us at least we are

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,750
aware we're going towards someone we're

00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,670
trying we're trying yeah we know we see

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,610
you we see you we understand we are

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,340
going to try and so on so that is

00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:39,620
actually I need to repeat I did not say

00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:43,160
please all conference organizers get the

00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:45,140
day care no that's not possible all the

00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,450
time no it's not possible but I like

00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,430
where idea of throwing this very very

00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:49,900
different very different I come from a

00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,940
very

00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,470
from play some super aware of deaths but

00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,470
it's also important that you ask other

00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,300
people having that awareness can someone

00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,520
help us here exactly if you think it's

00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,080
important as a sponsor if you think it's

00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,300
important to make sure that people with

00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,270
families can also participate in your

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,500
conference then how can you help us to

00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,240
achieve this this is what we want to

00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,880
achieve how can we achieve it as a

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,880
community as sponsors so on and so forth

00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:27,130
very human absolutely so I think in the

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:31,000
conference like realm these are key

00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:41,080
activities Terry you've worked in you

00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:42,670
know attack for a long time but but you

00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,860
know so you've you've you've worked on

00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,330
this issue in the companies you've

00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,940
worked in and and in the in the

00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,710
community what what can companies do

00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,360
like what are the concrete things that

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,180
we do to build this empathy to build

00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:57,250
this awareness into our into what we do

00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,780
you know I mean this is I got a

00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,820
management really early

00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:03,580
I was 26 when I became a manager for the

00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,380
first time which was ridiculous and it

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,990
was a position that was giving to me

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,450
slightly out of spite but it turns out

00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,600
that I really like people and working

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:18,250
with people so it became something that

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:21,430
I was hyper aware of as as a woman I had

00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,260
a lot of very great mentors and

00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,420
advocates over the course of my career

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,830
and thank God because otherwise I

00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,050
probably would have gone to jail for

00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,160
killing the people who were just being

00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:32,410
such jerks

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,880
because there was that - I'm half Irish

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,140
I can't help it but you know there's

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,620
there's the things that you hear about

00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:44,800
the harassment you know the the quid pro

00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:47,200
quo you know sort of thing and yes that

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,050
absolutely happens and it's horrible but

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,260
I in some ways that's easier to address

00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:57,400
and and less likely to happen than the

00:41:53,260 --> 00:42:00,370
incidental or sort of ignorant behaviors

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,680
that socially were kind of indoctrinated

00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:05,460
to

00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,900
and so as a manager you know my my take

00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,999
is that it's part of the leadership

00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,069
team's responsibility to lead the way in

00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:13,230
how do we establish ourselves as a

00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:15,420
culture what do we consider important

00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:18,420
the empathy thing is huge right and it

00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:21,259
applies to everyone I was like to say

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,880
like to say probably one of the toughest

00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:26,789
demographics to be in certain ways is

00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,200
the white white male introvert because

00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:29,700
you think oh here's the guy who's got

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,740
all the power and here's a guy who's so

00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,930
shy if you ask him to give a talk he's

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:38,009
gonna throw up right I mean that's it

00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:41,730
implies it applies to everybody yes see

00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:44,569
you're doing great if you're gonna throw

00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:48,390
up go off-screen okay

00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:50,460
it's the listening aspect to your point

00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,470
the listening aspect is amazing it's

00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,349
it's hearing what what is going on

00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:58,130
around you as a manager part of your job

00:42:55,349 --> 00:43:00,180
is to facilitate right you facilitate

00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,799
differences of opinion between your two

00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,690
principal engineers about how that API

00:43:01,799 --> 00:43:05,970
is going to be implemented you also

00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,099
facilitate the discussion for that shy

00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,450
person in the corner who may or may not

00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:11,759
be a member of an underrepresented

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,559
community statistically probably is if

00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:15,299
they're the shy person in the corner how

00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,039
do you make sure that you hear their

00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:18,720
voice how do you make sure that the the

00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,549
to loud voices don't completely

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,859
overwhelm the other voices in the room

00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:23,970
they're not doing it maliciously they're

00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,890
doing it because they're type-a

00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,950
personalities with things to say right

00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:30,960
and I'm sure they're very smart

00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,400
but they're not the only smart people

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,650
and as a manager you want to be making

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:42,900
sure that hey let's hear from you gotta

00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:46,230
speak more other things you know making

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,180
sure that the social events that your

00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,319
team might do team building is amazing

00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:50,549
I'm not sure how much it happens in

00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:52,619
Switzerland I'm assuring it it's

00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:54,690
probably drinking grappa and skiing or

00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:58,049
whatever it is that you guys do here but

00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:01,049
like you know if you have if you have

00:43:58,049 --> 00:44:04,049
people on your team who might be Muslim

00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:06,239
or Mormon or some other community that

00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:07,380
doesn't drink then going to the beer

00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,950
garden is probably not a great idea

00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:12,180
right or maybe there's a group that goes

00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,490
to the beer garden and there's the other

00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,820
group that goes to the tea house make it

00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:20,390
that people have choices by the way ski

00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:23,490
trips are pretty tough on the disabled

00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:25,410
though you know accessible skiing I love

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,390
the people who see on the little cart I

00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:29,460
mean those people are amazing but not

00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,619
everybody does that right so it's it's

00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,390
little things like that and just kind of

00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,770
being where and it's not that you want

00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:36,720
to limit it to the greatest common

00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:39,030
denominator which which is everybody

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,550
goes to the tea house it's you could

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:48,390
make it so that there's an assortment of

00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:54,090
events or you don't like tea the dry

00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:59,790
religion we don't even say well I'm just

00:44:54,090 --> 00:45:02,100
not trying hard enough so but but anyway

00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:04,290
to close out my point is that it's it's

00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,660
a lifestyle like I also give talks on

00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,850
DevOps DevOps is also a lifestyle yes

00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,080
right it's really the approach that you

00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:12,000
think about it you're trying to solve a

00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,350
problem the problem in this case is how

00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,970
do we as a community they're an

00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:17,310
open-source community or a corporate

00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:19,440
community how do we do the best that we

00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,480
possibly can the best way to do that is

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,640
to make sure that everybody that is

00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,320
already in that community has a voice

00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,810
because they might have a really good

00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,250
idea yep and that when we're looking for

00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:31,260
people to join our community or we're

00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,200
doing hiring practices that we're making

00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,840
sure that we are looking in the farthest

00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,859
reaches of any possible sourcing to find

00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,109
those people that actually would be

00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:41,550
really great because they're bringing a

00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:42,840
new voice that we didn't have before

00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,550
they're bringing exposures to

00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,710
communities that might be new customers

00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:50,190
or they have experiences that would be

00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:51,750
really beneficial it's it's to not think

00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,359
in terms of well I'm a color blind

00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:57,750
person I don't see color and which means

00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:59,460
everybody is equal right okay it's a

00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:01,500
terrible idea never think that right

00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,350
it's like I want to see a lot of colors

00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:08,869
because all of those colors have have

00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:12,390
something to bring to the table right HR

00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:15,390
departments love me I'm female I'm over

00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:18,030
40 I'm married I'm gay

00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,950
I have kids like you can check off all

00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:22,560
kinds of boxes like I can fill out a

00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:26,850
quota so fast but know that it matters

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,680
oh and I'm temporary klutzy that's my

00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:33,260
disabled

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:36,320
let's see how will you got me beat the

00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:40,790
point is it's it's something that you

00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:42,800
need to be conscious of every day it's

00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,090
not something you just kind of I'm sure

00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,950
probably a lot of you have gone through

00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,930
diversity training and you've probably

00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,970
slept through it right I've slept

00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,800
through it it's terrible because it

00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:55,280
doesn't really tell you anything useful

00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:58,040
it checks off a box right true diversity

00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,080
training would be hey is there an office

00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,340
in another country it's full of people

00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,540
who speak a language that you don't

00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,710
speak again we're in Switzerland so

00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,070
that's probably not going to happen you

00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,630
guys speak every language known to man

00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,430
but it's just putting yourself out there

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,140
and being in those experiences as much

00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,970
as possible one of the beauties of the

00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,620
Internet is that we can be in those

00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:18,140
experiences without actually having to

00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:20,690
go anywhere in some cases right yep but

00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:23,420
it really is kind of a way of life a way

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,670
of thinking a way of constantly paying

00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,620
attention to the people around you and

00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:30,680
how they act and how they more

00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,750
importantly how they react right and are

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,550
you open to how it is that they're

00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:36,980
existing and and this is a learnable

00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:38,870
skill it is totally horrible I was the

00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:43,460
most oblivious person I mean we all were

00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:49,310
right out of college except for the

00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:51,500
people in this room who here actually

00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:53,000
shows how much of a not-idiot you are

00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,620
because you're already getting out there

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,660
and meeting people probably from all

00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:59,720
over the world you've come to this okay

00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,550
so I'm gonna stop us there just because

00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,820
we have about nine nine minutes left

00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:10,640
I've been using your watch for four

00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:12,860
questions so I'm gonna do you know what

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,930
Mike yeah don't move if you could swing

00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,490
your chair out a little bit I'm just

00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,960
gonna mix this up a little because I

00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:24,800
think some of these questions you can

00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:27,980
really contribute to as well okay so

00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,700
first how you got some props for sharing

00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:33,680
your story and I think that has been

00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:38,500
incredibly meaningful and valuable for

00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,500
all of us to hear so thank you for that

00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:52,900
so perhaps Daria you're gonna have the

00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:54,010
best answer to this and I might add some

00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,090
color but it's our most up voted

00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:00,400
question so far and the question is was

00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,470
there an incident or event in the past

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,010
that triggered such a strong emphasis on

00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:10,180
the code of conduct you're asking me

00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:13,320
well you know I'm why we're doing it now

00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:17,500
yes this way because I mean there are

00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:19,990
many many many incidences constantly

00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,270
right this is not some they're probably

00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:25,210
there was or I don't know Heather would

00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:28,240
probably know because she co-founded the

00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,510
Scala Center to start with you know

00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,550
actually I think for the sake of a yes

00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,619
directive productive conversation that

00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:38,020
we can all learn from I would love to

00:49:35,619 --> 00:49:40,630
hear from you like what is the value to

00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,820
the Code of Conduct and do you think a

00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:47,050
code of conduct actually influences

00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:49,540
behavior or provides us - of course it

00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:54,130
influences and especially the repetition

00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:56,020
is what I think influenced so the why we

00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:00,100
are doing it is because there are many

00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:02,980
incidences and we want to try to see if

00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:05,130
this is going to so we have like it can

00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,000
at some some other conferences

00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:09,130
experience like this is a best practice

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:13,150
type of a thing that we are doing now

00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:15,730
and we will see I mean I'm actually I

00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:19,109
would like to ask back and I will after

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:21,910
when I again start my like did it change

00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:24,580
in my opinion seeing how people are

00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:26,859
really gathered and and having fun and

00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:31,720
dancing and going to the diversity lunch

00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:33,850
I would say it contributes to that in

00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,480
the direction right I have no idea I

00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:40,540
will tell you what when I do any

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:43,000
thoughts on where conduct and I mean I'm

00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,580
a huge proponent of code of conduct and

00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,619
I'm not just for conferences but for you

00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,019
know open source communities

00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:52,569
Google open-source projects always have

00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:55,329
a code of conduct and I can point you

00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:58,739
last year when when the Linux Foundation

00:50:55,329 --> 00:51:02,380
and - Torvalds finally admitted that his

00:50:58,739 --> 00:51:04,809
behavior fairly notorious over the years

00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,519
had contributed to problems with

00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:08,109
contributors in that project I mean if

00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:10,089
it sounds like the the scala community

00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:11,859
has all kinds of fun let me tell you the

00:51:10,089 --> 00:51:15,160
Linux contributors were not having fun

00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:17,680
that was armed battle every day for 20

00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,650
years they're trying to change it now

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:24,009
but think about how much more advanced

00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:26,890
the Linux kernel could be now if they

00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:28,150
had not gone through that well they're

00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:30,009
still going through you know trying to

00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,839
recover it I think that's another thing

00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:33,700
that's really important is that it is

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,249
harder to change an existing culture

00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:38,890
than it is to start out with good intent

00:51:36,249 --> 00:51:41,109
right it's it's it makes all the

00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:43,719
difference in the world just to be clear

00:51:41,109 --> 00:51:45,219
I only answered that like about the

00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,170
parts of the question why we are doing

00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:49,299
it now reinforcing it but I absolutely

00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:53,349
believe in the condo connect and and

00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:55,119
also adapting the code of conduct as we

00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:58,839
go and as we see that certain things

00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:00,339
need to be included in so it's like but

00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:02,769
it quantifies it it gives you a

00:52:00,339 --> 00:52:04,229
something to point at they say you know

00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:06,789
what we're not making a judgment call

00:52:04,229 --> 00:52:10,079
right judgement calls are the death of

00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:10,079
any group yes

00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:17,619
thank you I love this next question it's

00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:20,529
it's an interesting one and it's now the

00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:21,789
most up voted so got a lot of votes

00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:25,329
while we were talking about the code of

00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:27,279
conduct do you think it's fair to put

00:52:25,329 --> 00:52:29,979
diversity first and professional

00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:34,239
competence second when you're talking

00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:36,130
about hiring Wow fighting words at I'd

00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:39,099
love to get your guys's thoughts and

00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:42,940
then I sit back and watch someone else

00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:44,979
speak here well I will speak about this

00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:49,809
because I don't think there's a such

00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:51,099
thing as pudding I said they don't want

00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:55,059
my ear so I'm gonna tell you real fast

00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:57,700
before you run out please

00:52:55,059 --> 00:53:00,099
take care of the curtain on stage sorry

00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:09,430
this is a fire

00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:14,019
but take care good answer to the

00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:18,959
question thanks all for coming let's go

00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:18,959
save ourselves from they've by the Bell
