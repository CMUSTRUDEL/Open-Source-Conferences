morning everyone I thank you for being

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,300
here thank you for waking up for the

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,920
Kino and for my talk and thank you for

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,559
coming to a talk about community I think

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,570
code is often the easy part of our jobs

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,460
and I really appreciate that you're

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,050
taking the time to spend the morning

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,359
with me as we talk about some of the

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,730
issues that are the harder parts of our

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,460
jobs the the people parts and not the

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,630
code parts so I'm deeply grateful that

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,640
you're choosing this one your time here

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,730
this morning with me talking about the

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,770
scala community my name is Kelly

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,809
Robinson I work at a company called

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,989
Twilio you might know us from your

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,149
lanyards we our communications company

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:46,289
that builds api's for adding things like

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,899
SMS email voice video authentication

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,610
into your applications I work on the

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,110
developer relations team at Twilio I'm

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,199
specifically support the account

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,660
security products there and so my job is

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,829
about being in the community this is

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,530
something that I've been doing for about

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,690
two years now before that I was working

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,000
in a lot of scholar roles which is why

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,130
I'm involved with all the this lovely

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,049
people in the scala community but my

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,290
retire my job requires that I do things

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,390
like writing documentation and getting

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,759
developer feedback on our products and

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,850
so I speak at technical events like this

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,009
on technical topics I attend events like

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,290
Scala days I go to meetups I write blog

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,860
posts but I want to tell you about how I

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,150
got here because my job started out and

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,009
normal engineering I guess you could say

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,630
I haven't been doing this community work

00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:39,840
full-time for all of my career so in

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,659
2013 I attended a coding bootcamp this

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,460
is not something that I talk about a lot

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,799
there's a stigma around coding boot

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,960
camps that you know maybe they don't

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,070
have the same type of educational

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,280
background as somebody that got a

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,579
traditional CS background in my coding

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,850
career I have been worried about being

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,409
taken seriously and so I didn't talk

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,840
about the fact that I did a coding boot

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,750
camp often because I was worried that

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
that would let people that would form a

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,860
different opinion of me that maybe they

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,870
wouldn't take me as seriously but our

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,310
industry is flooded with boot camp grads

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,370
now

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,810
especially in the US and there's people

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,640
like me that have been doing

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,520
professional programming now for six

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,890
years which in San Francisco basically

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,390
makes you a distinguished engineer so I

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,890
shouldn't be ashamed of this anymore

00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:34,010
right but I was really lucky after going

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,560
to the boot camp where I studied Python

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:40,100
and go I got hired by this company to

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,230
write Scala and I was lucky that I had

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,450
some very patient mentors and some

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,790
people that were willing to give me very

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,830
thorough code reviews that were willing

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:51,950
to teach me what it was like to work in

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,300
a professional organization that would

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,660
teach me what it was like to write

00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,480
production code and it was it was a

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,060
really great experience but when I was

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,640
at versal in 2013 I was living in San

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,600
Francisco at the time and I went to my

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,640
first Scala Meetup

00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,560
I was writing Scala code and I wanted to

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,069
learn a little bit more and this was the

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,620
Scala meetup in 2013 where rod Johnson

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,810
was on a panel defending whatever he had

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,780
talked about in his keynote at Scala

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:23,600
days in 2013 I wasn't at Scala days in

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,579
2013 if any of you were apparently it

00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,230
was very controversial and so they

00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,690
actually invited him to a follow up

00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,940
panel to basically defend what he was

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:33,920
talking about I didn't really understand

00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,959
any of the controversy I was very new to

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,579
all of this but I showed up at this

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,040
Meetup I was really eager to like meet

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,630
people and talk to people I didn't know

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,959
anyone there and so I was kind of like

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,269
standing awkwardly by myself and

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,670
somebody came up to me and talked to me

00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,840
and they asked me to refill the coffee I

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,209
didn't go back to a Scala me up for

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,600
three years that was a really

00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,950
discouraging experience for me because

00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,359
when you're in that kind of environment

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,100
and you're being vulnerable and you're

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,380
putting yourself out there the last

00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,829
thing that you want to do is be mistaken

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,720
for the kitchen staff so I spent a

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,850
couple of years writing Scala code and

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,799
then I wanted to see how another company

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,239
did did Production Engineering and so I

00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,280
went over to this company called share

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,130
through where I did ad tech for a few

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,720
years I did a lot of data engineering

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,979
and distributed systems there that was

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,760
where I learned a lot about how to work

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:28,410
with spark

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,870
and it was really interesting for me

00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:35,220
because I had been the junior engineer

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:36,900
at versal I was the person that I I was

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,790
always always asking the questions right

00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,980
like I was working with other more

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,330
senior engineers but when I went over to

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,150
share through all the sudden people were

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,710
asking for my advice I was the one that

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,360
came in with a lot of Scala knowledge

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,340
most of the other engineers on our team

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,230
had only done Java previously and it

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,870
picked up Scala on the job like I had it

00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:57,000
at my previous role and so suddenly I

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,400
was in this position of being the person

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,530
that could give other people advice and

00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,170
that was really really empowering for me

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,660
because I got to be in kind of this new

00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:10,800
level this new level of my career where

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,420
all of a sudden I was giving back and it

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,520
was while I was at share through that I

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,990
kind of worked up the courage to say I'm

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,900
going to start spreading this knowledge

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,330
to other people this is something that I

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,770
now have enough confidence in my

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,750
abilities that this is something that I

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,250
want to share with others and so I

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,020
worked up the courage to submit a

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,590
conference talk proposal in Scala days

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,020
in 2016 it got accepted and I gave my

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,770
first ever conference talk about three

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,420
years ago at Scala days in New York City

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:40,860
this was three years ago I was three

00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,960
years into my career as a software

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,780
engineer I was still really worried

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
about being taken seriously and I really

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,290
wanted to present myself as somebody

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,090
with a lot of technical credibility I

00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,030
didn't want to be mistaken for the

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,580
kitchen staff and so I gave this talk

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,910
called why the free monad isn't free how

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,050
many of you know what free monads are

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,760
like half of you that are raising your

00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,200
hands are lying right now like nobody

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,450
actually knows what this stuff is right

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,340
like I didn't know what this was when I

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,930
submitted the talk and I did this thing

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:12,510
that I do for my talk so that I like to

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,550
call talk driven development which is if

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,800
there's something I want to understand I

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,600
force myself to explain it to other

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,970
people and then I make sure that I

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,180
understand it and so I worked really

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:27,000
hard on this talk I was very very

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,430
terrified I I was terrified of the

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,740
trolls I was terrified of people being

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,940
mean to me I was terrified of people not

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,159
taking me seriously

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,610
but I prepped the hell out of that talk

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:42,129
and I got through it and people liked it

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,569
it went over pretty well martin order

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:45,069
she was in the audience for that talk

00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:49,869
which I'm very glad I didn't know until

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:51,489
after the talk was over I'm still really

00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:53,469
really proud of what I did there and the

00:06:51,489 --> 00:06:55,449
people that it's hopefully helped and I

00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,249
tell this story because this was my

00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,289
first real introduction into the scala

00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:01,479
community it took me three years to get

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,550
to that point because of that one bad

00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:06,069
experience that I had had and at this

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,229
point like this is 2016 I've been

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:09,819
working in Scala for three years like I

00:07:08,229 --> 00:07:12,149
was one of the more experienced call

00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,619
developers in the industry and III

00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,509
didn't really understand that I had

00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:18,939
something to share and so what I want to

00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,740
talk about today is ways that I can

00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,719
encourage all of you to participate in

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,129
this community encourage people to

00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:26,409
participate and share their knowledge

00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:28,119
without being as scared as I was and

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,279
hopefully we can make the community a

00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:34,829
place where people will be encouraged

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:36,849
and want to to participate in that way

00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,309
but there was something else I noticed

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:40,959
at Scala days in 2016 which was there

00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,879
were a lot of women at the conference

00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,789
there especially weren't a lot of women

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:50,050
speakers there were actually three women

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:51,279
speakers out of 55 I counted it was me

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,949
it was Heather Miller and there was one

00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,019
other and so we were the representation

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,329
on stage and so when I got back to San

00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,159
Francisco after that conference I was

00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:01,749
really energized and I decided that I

00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,319
wanted to start this program called

00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:07,029
Scala bridge and Scala bridge mission is

00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:09,039
to build an inclusive Scala community

00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,619
with introductory programming workshops

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,749
for underrepresented groups this is

00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:15,279
something that is a model that's been

00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:16,709
done in other language communities

00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,999
there's actually an overarching

00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:21,159
organization called bridge foundry that

00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,619
helps organize a lot of these different

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,199
language bridges and so there's a Ruby

00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:28,360
on Rails bridge a go bridge a mobile

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,550
bridge and Elmbridge and there's a

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,439
scholar bridge and so with the help of

00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,959
the bridge foundry organization we got

00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:37,479
the workshops off the ground and I don't

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,279
have the exact numbers but since 2017

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,469
when we did the first workshop in San

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,990
Francisco we've put on over two dozen

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,610
workshops in many many countries and so

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,470
a big round of applause to everybody

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,790
that's been involved with that thank you

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,860
very much

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:55,300
for helping out but in 2016 there was

00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,070
something else that was introduced to

00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,110
the community that is arguably even more

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,830
important and that was the Scala Center

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:05,850
and the Scala Center is for open source

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,570
and education as many of you know and

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,520
education is something that I think

00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,590
underlies both of these organizations

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,440
that I think is crucial to developing a

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:16,930
strong community because the community

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,570
is all of us and I want all of us to

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:21,280
feel welcome so this quote is actually

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,860
directly stolen from Heather's talk

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,770
about introducing the Scala Center in

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,170
2016 and I think it still remains true

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,720
right like you we all have to be a part

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,040
of this to make the community great but

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,010
if you're not somebody that spends a lot

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,450
of time in the work are at conferences

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,730
or what you might consider like the

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,250
wider language community community is

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,420
also applicable in your workplace the

00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,870
things that I'm going to talk about

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:49,690
today are equally relevant in your

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,360
offices cultivating a supportive team

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,760
environment isn't that different from

00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,480
cultivating a supportive wider language

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,400
community conferences like Scala days

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
are a great place to engage with other

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,180
developers and this is also true of your

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,400
regional meetup if you're not somebody

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,200
that has the ability to come to

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,120
Switzerland for a lot of these events a

00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,800
lot of times there are these user groups

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,490
in your communities that you live in

00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,870
where you can engage with other people

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,840
but there is a place that we're all

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,850
engaging and that's online and places

00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,740
like Stack Overflow github getter black

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,780
they're accessible to anyone and while

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,150
they create a lot of opportunities they

00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,460
also breed miscommunication and

00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,290
hostility and I think we saw that in the

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,670
keynote this morning that open-source

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,710
communities aren't necessarily always

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,390
the most welcomed and there's a lot of

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,650
ways to misinterpret what people say

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,480
there's a lot of rude behavior that

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,510
happens there and so there are steps

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,650
that we can take to help mitigate this

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,990
but how do we do it how do we build

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,670
about our community and the answer is

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,260
that we can't do it alone we all have to

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,600
take steps to make this a more welcoming

00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,600
place but I have three recommendations

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,030
that I want to share with you and these

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,650
are by any means not an exhaustive list

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,630
there's obviously a lot of things that

00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:07,820
we can do as a community to make the

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,860
place places that we operate more

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:11,590
welcoming but the three things that I

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:16,220
want to focus on are practicing empathy

00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:17,330
building trust and empowering others so

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,790
we'll start with practicing empathy

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,970
empathy is this idea that you have the

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,100
ability to understand others emotions

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,560
more than that it's about being able to

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,000
understand and react to others needs and

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,010
concerns and how they are reacting

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,500
emotionally empathy is a key part of

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:35,780
emotional intelligence this is a hard

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,670
thing to master but it's something that

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,560
we can all actively work on because

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,180
empathy is a skill that can be developed

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,950
it's not something that everybody is

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,960
born with it's something that we can

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,030
work on and I'm gonna tell you a couple

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,600
of tricks that I've learned how we can

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,910
do that i but I want to share this quote

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,860
from Mike Schur who is the creator of

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,520
shows like Parks and Recreation in the

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,320
good place

00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,230
he's personal hero of mine I love this

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,880
guy and so he did a reddit AMA last year

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,410
where somebody asked if you had a

00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,000
machine that could dispense an infinite

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,340
amount of anything what would that be

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,500
and his answer was empathy and you can

00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,330
see this reflected in the stories that

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,820
he tells if you've ever watched one of

00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,320
these shows that he's created you find

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,750
yourself rooting for all the characters

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,090
because he has a great way of developing

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,620
their interpersonal relationships he has

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,240
a great way of getting the audience to

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,640
empathize with empathize with their

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,440
problems and he understands what the

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,780
audience wants and what the audience is

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,080
concerned about so that he can reflect

00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,580
that in the characters that he develops

00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,140
this is important because understanding

00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,090
your audience understanding the people

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,660
that you're catering to is incredibly

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:44,090
lucrative empathy is lucrative Mike sure

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,180
just signed in 125 million dollar deal

00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,500
to work at NBC for the next five years

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,170
this is the type of thing that is going

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,650
to grow your business and make people

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:57,110
want to work with you so in your own

00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:00,140
life some of the ways you can practice

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,190
empathy is to start by asking why and

00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:06,260
especially instead of asking how first I

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,050
think of Scala developers and software

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,140
engineers a lot of times we get really

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,690
excited by asking how how are we going

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,340
to build this how are we going to decide

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,220
what to

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,920
to use what frameworks are we going to

00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,690
implement which libraries are we going

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,430
to import these are the questions that

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,190
we often immediately jump to and I'm

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:30,040
very guilty of this as well but if you

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,660
want to start and empathize with the the

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,550
people that you're building for you need

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,740
to start by asking why you're building

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,240
the things that you're building you'll

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,290
really dig into this if you've ever done

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,940
a post-mortem exercise there's a famous

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,800
method of doing this called five wives

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,600
which is basically you ask why things

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,720
happen at least five times to try to get

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,060
to the root cause and it's really easy

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,590
to snap to judgment about why things are

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,870
built the way that they are but this is

00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,370
another way that you can ask start by

00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,560
asking why - hopefully empathize with

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,360
your co-workers I mean is there anything

00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,400
more annoying than somebody coming into

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,160
your project and just over

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,860
everything that you've built so somebody

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,720
comes in like oh why are you using

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,340
scotch oh that's terrible

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,500
this is a real thing that somebody said

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,760
once at one of my companies that person

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,420
was me but I didn't ask why I was just

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,280
like this is garbage what are you doing

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,560
but the answer that I got when I finally

00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,480
somebody explained why without me

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,910
actually asking was that it was an

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,340
internal service at the time that it was

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,200
built sculpture made sense it was also

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,930
an important service but it only got

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,860
about 12 requests per month it wasn't

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:44,280
broken and so nobody needed to fix it so

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,280
don't do this

00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:49,450
but this also gets into the answers that

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:52,480
don't have as much of like a business

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,770
case behind them right so there was a

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,290
project that shared through that

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,060
inspired my free monads talk because it

00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,760
was using free monads all throughout it

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,160
and when I finally asked why that was

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,110
happening the answer was that the

00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,240
developer who built it just kind of felt

00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,960
like it there wasn't really a business

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,120
case behind that decision and I think

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,740
this is something that is it points to

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,570
you know the more dangerous aspects of

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,700
how we get into these types of problems

00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,890
so think about Jurassic Park right like

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,630
they were so busy thinking about whether

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,850
or not they could but they never stopped

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,080
to think whether or not they should so

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,450
this is something that I like to remind

00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,120
people of just because you can build

00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,000
something

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,800
using these tools and the hottest latest

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,240
framework doesn't mean that you

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,790
necessarily should it's really easy to

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,440
over engineer things especially in Scala

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,380
where there's a million ways to build

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,510
everything right so people have very

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,010
strong opinions about how to build

00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,660
different types of software and Scala

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,820
there's the you know the pure functional

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,440
camp there's the we just came from Java

00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,180
and so we're gonna write more Java Scala

00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,550
camp there's there's all these different

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,740
styles of Scala and it's really easy to

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,529
get into a mindset of what has to be a

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,420
certain way but I want to encourage you

00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,520
to think about more practical solutions

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,190
and keep this question what does the

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,529
customer need in the front of your mind

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,570
and this can be challenging right like

00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:17,600
Scala is mostly a back-end language

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,980
sometimes the end user customer is so

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,470
many levels removed from what you're

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,820
actually working on you might have not

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,490
have like a direct line of communication

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,250
with the stuff that they're concerned

00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:30,290
about but I think it's essential to

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,060
understand how what you're building is

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,250
affecting the people who are using it

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,110
even if those people are other engineers

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,970
at the company maybe you're conserving

00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,100
an internal API that your friend and

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,290
developers are consuming from some kind

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,760
of front-end application you can talk to

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,410
them about how they're consuming that

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,420
and you can talk to them about how

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,130
they're been presenting the data there

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,839
are ways to have these conversations to

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,580
build these empties empathy with your

00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:54,110
customers and with the other people that

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,290
are using the software that you've built

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,000
this is really important because it's

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,220
essential to understand what you're

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,930
building and how it's going to be used

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,059
there's privacy and security

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,670
implications with a lot of this there's

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:09,740
ethical implications and then this does

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,870
tie back to a lot of the practicality

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,670
and also long-term planning right like

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,610
if you are building something that you

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,740
know a customer needs ASAP because of X

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:20,420
Y & Z like this is something that we run

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,640
into an industry and sometimes you just

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,800
have to do that but if you know that in

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,329
six months you're going to have a

00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,920
slightly different use case or maybe

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,720
there's regulation that is coming down

00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,400
the line you might have to think ahead

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,340
about how you're going to have to

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,750
rebuild something or the fact that it

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,910
might be easier to scrap the small

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,310
project that you have and do it

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,570
differently think about the the types of

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,500
people that you're going to be working

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,760
with

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,980
and how they're going to be able to

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,600
onboard into that project there's a lot

00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,870
of considerations that you can make in

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,650
these types of situations to help make a

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:57,140
better product uh and one reason this is

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,370
hard is because Allah is an academic

00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,400
language

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:03,920
it was developed here at this university

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,290
because computer scientists write like

00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,390
writing languages and as far as I know

00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,400
it wasn't initially written to solve a

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,140
specific use case I don't know if

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,650
Martin's in here but you can correct me

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,180
if I'm wrong about that the majority of

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,270
the people in here probably work in

00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:22,820
industry and we do have a customer at

00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,100
the other end and you know what that

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,930
customer doesn't care about they don't

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,310
care about how pure your code is like

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,500
you might care about that and I'm not

00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:33,790
saying that that doesn't matter but you

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,910
also need to keep the customer in mind

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,280
another important thing to consider is

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,440
and this will help you practice empathy

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,010
with your co-workers and your customers

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,480
is understanding someone's background

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,830
and this will help you engage with them

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,350
especially if you're trying to explain

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,120
something or teach something so if you

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,310
consider someone's language background

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,480
I'm going to explain a Scala concept

00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:58,340
much differently to somebody who comes

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,150
from Java than somebody who comes from

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,620
JavaScript JavaScript has much more

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,020
functional paradigms especially lately

00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,190
I know javis moving into that but we

00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,510
know the people that have come to Java

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,790
and how they approached Scala there's

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,620
different ways that you can introduce

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,470
new concepts to people based on where

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,720
they're coming from maybe those people

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,100
have only worked at large companies and

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,420
therefore are specialized in one or two

00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,710
things maybe they're not familiar with

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,960
the type of build systems that you're

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,550
using in your startups maybe they came

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,740
from an enterprise software a background

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,270
where they had a lot of closed source

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,530
that they were working with so you can

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,000
start to think about these different

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,620
ways that you can engage with the types

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,150
of people that you're working with to

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:39,890
better understand and empathize with

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:42,350
them my second recommendation is all

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,120
about building trust and it's harder for

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,320
people to feel welcome in your space if

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,810
they can't trust that they will be

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,340
respected in your space and building

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,730
trust is crucial to building a

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,620
supportive and strong community a big

00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,320
way to destroy trust is to pretend like

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,149
you know everything

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,879
so my therapist actually gave me the saw

00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:04,009
exercise which was if you give someone a

00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,750
project who are you going to trust more

00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:07,610
the person is like yep cool got it and

00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,830
walks away or the person that's like

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,480
considers it for a minute and then asks

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,639
for help and questions about the things

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,110
that they don't understand and I think

00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:18,049
we tend to trust people that actually

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,519
ask the thoughtful questions the key

00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,169
here is that asking thoughtful questions

00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,360
actually makes you seem smarter

00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:25,929
no one knows everything and no one

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,970
should have to pretend like they do and

00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:30,799
this is an obvious right this is

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,600
actually hard to ask good questions so

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,159
here's a great framework that I stole

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,009
from my friend Catherine on how to ask

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,929
good questions and so her framework is

00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:41,779
this it says I'm trying to do something

00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:44,330
so that I can achieve something else I'm

00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:45,919
running into insert your problem here

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,500
and here are the things that I've tried

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,840
to fix it there's a lot of benefits of

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,210
using a framework like this so it

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,740
clarifies your thought process it

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,870
doesn't waste someone else's time

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,200
because if you can ask a question with

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:02,000
these types of thoughtful considerations

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,320
in it the person that you're asking that

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,850
to is like oh this person's thought

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,769
through this right like and it's also

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,649
going to be make it easier for them to

00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,870
help you it showcases the effort that

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:13,460
you've done so even if you don't know

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,440
something like there's no shame in not

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,149
knowing something but then you're also

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,490
level setting with what you do know and

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:21,529
what you do understand and finally in

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,490
the process of doing something like this

00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:26,629
of constructing this type of question

00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,639
this is like the rubber duck method

00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:30,980
right like by the time you end up at the

00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:32,080
end of this question you might answer

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,539
your own question

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,820
so a way that I use this recently I'm

00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,009
trying to edit our auto-generated

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,720
documentation there was a bunch of code

00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:44,600
repositories that were needed to do that

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:47,720
so that I can fix the broken code sample

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,279
I'm running into some failing tests I've

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,230
looked at the equivalent product

00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,919
documentation in a different product and

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,659
I tried editing these two files and when

00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,580
I presented somebody on our team with

00:21:56,659 --> 00:22:00,529
this they were like okay well you didn't

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,990
need to edit X&Y files you actually

00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,850
needed to add it dzifa and that's why

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,559
the test is breaking and so this is

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,899
something that made it a lot easier for

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,810
that person to help me and made it

00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:14,130
easier for me to get my

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:16,080
question answered but this type of

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,840
exercise isn't just for junior

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,330
developers or new people to the language

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,010
or the industry asking for help is

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,780
really hard so if you're in a position

00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:27,660
of power if you have senior in your

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,120
title you really need to model this

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:33,240
behavior and that's this whole idea that

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,010
reciprocity builds trust you can show

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,780
people that it's normal to ask for help

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:39,030
show people that is normal to ask

00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,760
questions ask clarifying questions

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,350
nobody knows every acronym inserting

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,810
yourself to get clarity will help other

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,060
people in the room I work in a lot of

00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,770
security related stuff now and in

00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,840
security there's this whole industry

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,640
behind social engineering and social

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,890
engineering is the idea that I can call

00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,500
and try to steal my friends information

00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,290
by convincing the Verizon or the the

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,480
telecom agent that I am either her or

00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:05,160
her mother or something like that

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,900
but you have to build trust with the

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,910
person that you're trying to exploit in

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,860
that situation and the people who study

00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,900
this understand the psychology behind

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,510
this of the reciprocity that you need to

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,060
do in order to gain someone's trust and

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,400
so that can be as simple as oh well I

00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,620
see that I'm running this version of my

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,110
operating system what version are you

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,000
running and so by offering up

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,710
information about myself people are more

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,540
willing to offer up information about

00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:32,040
them and this is a way that you can

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,450
build trust that people are going to

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,150
assume that you know what you're talking

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,620
about but also assume that that's safe

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,570
to share that kind of information with

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:44,220
you and this is all about making these

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,990
more welcoming spaces another trick to

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,130
building trust is to avoid feigning

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,470
surprise and so an example of this is

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,700
feigning surprise happens when I'm like

00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,320
somebody says to me hey Kelly you know

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,000
like I've been using Apache spark and

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,240
I'm like what's what's that like you

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,250
don't know what a patchy spark is like

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,140
nobody likes to be reacted to like that

00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,850
and so instead of feigning that type of

00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,560
surprise the way that you can answer

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,270
those types of situations oh it's cool

00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,130
it's the data library that we've been

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,990
using to process large-scale data let me

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,670
let me tell you about it there's a lot

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,920
of ways to react to those types of

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,750
situations that don't essentially

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,940
diminish and shame people for not having

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,710
that kind of knowledge this trick came

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,810
from the the

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,670
recurse Center handbook the ricoeur

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:28,710
Center is this programmer retreat in New

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:30,270
York City where experienced programmers

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,460
can go for three months to just kind of

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:36,060
learn something new it's really cool and

00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,790
I suggest that you check it out but I

00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,800
don't think that I can understate

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,530
overstate how important vona ability is

00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,270
in building trust being vulnerable and

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,920
authentic is one of the most effective

00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,110
ways that I've seen to gain someone's

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,170
stress everybody loves a good story

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,820
about failure and so I really want to

00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,740
encourage you to admit when you don't

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,540
know something because this does

00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,100
something that helps normalize it growth

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,710
my instead of like we're all programmers

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,630
none of us know everything we're all

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,790
learning all the time that's basically

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,940
what we're paid to do is be professional

00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,410
learners and Googlers right let people

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,630
see you make mistakes

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:16,050
no Welsh gave a really great talk

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:18,150
yesterday about teaching Scala and he

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:20,670
mentioned that live coding is a really

00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,800
great way to teach other people how you

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,840
do your job because it puts you in a

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,150
very vulnerable situation right people

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,550
see you mess up but they also see how

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,140
you recover from those mistakes and so

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,790
it normalizes this idea that you're

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,590
gonna run into a bunch of compiler

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,440
errors before you get something working

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,850
it shows how you can debug that code it

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,850
teaches you about the tools that you're

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:43,260
using and that's a really powerful way

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,150
for people to start to build confidence

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,070
in recovering from mistakes and

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,780
normalizing the fact that everybody is

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:51,420
going to be making a lot of mistakes in

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,220
their daily jobs I had a mentor at my

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,260
first job that I would ask all of my

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,490
questions to and so for the first couple

00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,660
of months and every time I ran into

00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,520
something that I didn't know how to do I

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,310
would ask them about it and then there

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,180
was one day probably about two months in

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,530
then I went over to him and I was like

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,140
this isn't working like what's going on

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:07,710
he was like oh I don't know let's figure

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,540
it out

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:11,580
and he like takes the error message I

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,380
was getting types it into Google shows

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,210
me how to like find the best Stack

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,090
Overflow answer and I was like gosh darn

00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:20,750
it I could have done that and that was a

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,160
very very powerful example of somebody

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,290
being vulnerable I don't think they were

00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,780
doing it intentionally but it's an

00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,130
example of how you can show that it's

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,440
expected that you're going to be

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,180
learning in this process you're teaching

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,860
someone how to get the answers for

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,500
themselves instead of just always giving

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,380
them the answer

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,420
pretending like you know everything when

00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,250
I talk to new engineers I often joke

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,260
about how like 90% of my job is just

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:47,170
googling and stuff and often they don't

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:48,730
believe me and I think that as you get

00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:50,890
more senior you like or get better at

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,930
asking Google questions maybe you're

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,730
asking like a few less questions but I

00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,590
think vulnerability is this idea that

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,530
you're still going to make mistakes and

00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:02,040
it doesn't really matter how experienced

00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,630
you are the stuff is still gonna happen

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:08,050
so another example of vulnerability is

00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:10,000
for my coworker Phil and so he said you

00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,030
know hello just lost a good 20 minutes

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,680
trying to debug a note app I used export

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,380
module and node apparently its modules

00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,270
export and of course since JavaScript is

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,470
not a compiled language you can't get

00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,150
that answer in less than 20 minutes

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,580
unless you find the air that you were

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,560
doing right so it's got like seven

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,860
hundred likes on Twitter people love

00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,900
hearing stories about experienced people

00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,760
making mistakes this is a really good

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,770
way to build empathy and be vulnerable

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,790
and build trust with the people in your

00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:41,410
community so if you are somebody that's

00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,650
looking for like talk inspiration or

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,390
blog post inspiration I would love to

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,000
see more Scala talks about how people

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,680
 up I don't think we get enough of

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,640
that in this community I think we get a

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:57,370
lot of talks about like yes thank you

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,840
I will help all of you write an abstract

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,490
about the mistakes that you have made

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,410
about how you have broken production

00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,790
with Scala that would be fascinating and

00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,460
we could do an entire conference about

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,020
that but this is something that like the

00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,600
learnings that you have from these types

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:15,360
of experiences are really really great

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:18,040
to share uh and this one kind of seems

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,800
obvious to say but like I think a lot of

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,880
people this is what stops people from

00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,040
submitting a lot of like conference talk

00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,490
proposals or writing blog posts about

00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,630
stuff but I like to share this example

00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,360
because this is like really basic

00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:33,790
knowledge I one of the things I do a lot

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,590
in Twilio is write technical blog posts

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,450
but as part of that the people on my

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:39,460
team we review each other's blog posts

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,980
and so I was reviewing my coworker Sam's

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:45,130
blog post about something that he built

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,330
with iOS and Swift and in his blog post

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:48,160
he had this thing I was like okay now

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,550
like test this on your device because it

00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,310
was something that you couldn't test

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,890
in the in the Swift simulator I was like

00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:57,140
well how do you do that like I took a

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,750
swift class I've like done enough Swift

00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,490
to be slightly dangerous with it but

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,290
like I'm not really an experienced Swift

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,880
developer and so I like googled it and I

00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,140
had to look at eight different sites in

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,210
order to get the answer that I needed

00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,310
and so I wrote up this blog post about

00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,130
how to test your iOS application on a

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:15,620
real device this is my best performing

00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,170
Twilio blog post this blog post gets

00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,880
thousands of views every single week and

00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:22,610
so this is something that I'd like to

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,930
share with people because it doesn't

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:26,330
have to be something that you're like an

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,760
expert on he doesn't have to be like the

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,960
most complicated technical topic for you

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,140
to share your knowledge about something

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,090
I think that the basic concepts are

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,860
really helpful to a lot of people and

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,880
this type of stuff should be shared more

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,220
and finally the third piece of advice

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,530
for building a stronger community is to

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,260
empower others and this is all about

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,660
making space for other people to

00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,340
participate this doesn't have to be a

00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,410
big gesture in fact one of my favorite

00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,270
recommendations for this is this idea of

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:59,060
the pac-man rule let anybody know what

00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:01,340
the pac-man rule is all right my

00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:04,370
coworker knows because I stole this from

00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,840
my other coworker so this is the idea

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,760
that if each one of these dots is a

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,860
person if you're at a physical event

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,180
like a conference or a meet-up you want

00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,620
to leave physical space you want to

00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,540
leave that packed be an opening for

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,700
someone to join your conversation and

00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,410
then when somebody does join the

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,790
conversation you expand the group and

00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:23,020
leave space for someone else to join

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:25,490
this is a very like specific example of

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,380
leaving like physical space for people

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,270
to participate but you can think about

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,890
how this applies to online communities

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,960
or other communities that you

00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,760
participate in you really want to make

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,890
it a possible for people to contribute

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,030
to your community from the keynote this

00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,710
morning when you're talking about

00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,390
open-source software

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,800
one way that open-source communities

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:46,310
have done this is by putting that like

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,900
Help Wanted badge on github issues I you

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,000
know like this is a good issue for

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,800
beginners as a way to signal for people

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,780
that their participation is encouraged

00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,610
in that community and that's kind of

00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:01,430
like the online example of leading this

00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:02,630
physical space but there's also ways

00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,490
that you can do this inside the

00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,860
workplace

00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,809
so senior engineers aren't grown on

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,580
trees so one way that you can do this is

00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,580
to hire and train folks that don't have

00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,830
Scala experience this also allows them

00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,840
to learn your systems in the way that

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,430
you're building things you don't

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,200
necessarily need to hire people with

00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:22,930
Scala experience in order for them to be

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,550
effective members of your team and your

00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,740
team will actually be stronger if you're

00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,750
willing to train people because by

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,430
developing people who are good at the

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:32,830
training and that are willing to learn

00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,360
those types of teaching exercises you're

00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:37,390
going to foster a stronger team

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:39,520
environment and I don't have the best

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,770
answer for how to develop a culture of

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,600
this I'd love to talk to people if they

00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:45,250
had teams that are successful about this

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,290
I talked to a couple of people that work

00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:49,330
at the BBC yesterday who were saying

00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,280
that they do a lot of pair programming

00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,970
and that's one way that they encourage

00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,650
this kind of feedback culture but one

00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,590
one idea that I have is to make

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:02,620
mentorship an expectation for

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:03,820
advancement in the workplace and so this

00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,500
is something that you can do in order to

00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,960
like get a promotion you have to have

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,640
shown experience or demonstrated the

00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:14,500
ability to train and mentor junior

00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:16,630
engineers on the team if you're outside

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,280
of the workplace there's a lot of other

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,380
ways that you can contribute and give

00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:24,070
back to the community and empower others

00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,809
there's teaching opportunities at events

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,610
like Scala Bruges you can either teach

00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:31,150
or plan a scholar bridge event in your

00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:33,760
community following the pac-man rule is

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:35,740
a great way to engage with people at

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,720
events like this you can answer

00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,190
questions on Stack Overflow coach

00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,480
someone on their Meetup presentation

00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,170
there's a lot of ways that you can give

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,540
back if you are interested in getting

00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,620
involved with Scala bridge you can check

00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,530
out our website

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,780
we are also on Twitter and then we have

00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,070
a slack channel that I you can

00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,570
participate in that's got several

00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,510
hundred members now and it's a very very

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,559
great place to get feedback on there's a

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,750
channel and they're all about teaching

00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:03,760
Scala there's definitely people in there

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,070
that have planned and coordinated other

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,970
events so you can DM me on Twitter for

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:12,520
the invite link to that um before I wrap

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,550
up I just I really want to personally

00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,000
thank these three people sorry I'm

00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,000
getting emotional

00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:30,000
so no leaf on Heather have really taken

00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:32,250
up the torch of scala bridge and these

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,330
three people have probably planned like

00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:37,800
80% of the Scala bridge events these are

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,560
just like really really awesome people

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,200
Knoll created and maintains all the the

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,180
curriculum and Heather has shepherded it

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,190
just since her time as the executive

00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,110
director of the Scala Center and Yvonne

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,000
is basically like taking over Scala

00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,680
bridge at this point she unfortunately

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,810
couldn't be at Scala days this year but

00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm very very grateful for all these

00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:59,130
people um I'm sorry for not recognizing

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,290
everybody who has participated in Scala

00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:06,540
bridge thank you very much for

00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:08,550
everything that you've done I'm sorry if

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,700
you are looking for web communities to

00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,500
get involved with and these are great

00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,410
great opportunities to get involved

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,450
online in communities that aren't

00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,400
hostile and so if you are a newer

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:23,070
programmer or I have people on your team

00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,960
that are getting getting started with

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:28,260
this type of thing a code newbies is

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,970
really great dev to is kind of like kind

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,060
of like hacker news but like there's not

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:34,770
 there and so they they do a

00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,240
really great job of like fostering in a

00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,060
community and these are not language

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,130
specific or anything like that but

00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,570
there's a lot of information on there

00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,490
and there's a lot of engagement on those

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,820
platforms that allows people to

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:49,260
participate in the communities so a

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,560
quick reminder of the things you can do

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,500
to build a better community the scala

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,420
community is all of ours and with a bit

00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,600
of kindness to ourselves and to each

00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,750
other I think we can continue to thrive

00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,750
thank you

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,970
I'm not gonna be taking questions right

00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,410
now but I'll be right outside of the

00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,440
Twilio booth after thank you all for

00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,440
coming

00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,360
[Applause]

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:30,180
