we are back in Lausanne but there was

00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,580
another thing happening in 2010 so that

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,759
the Scala days did not actually finish

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,860
when they are finished no everyone had

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,729
to stay a bit longer because can you

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,270
remember what it was

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:45,370
mm-hmm louder

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:51,699
okay whoever can pronounce it correctly

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:55,180
thank you for that so that is what

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,310
happened in 2010 and since then oh my

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,550

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,650
2014 that we had it in the US and in

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,690
Europe we had a lot of them I don't have

00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,930
all of the stickers here so if you have

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:11,590
stickers from from the year's 2018 in

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,479
Berlin or 2013 in New York I take them

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,440
so I can update the slide thank you very

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:20,919
much and we co-located with a type level

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,250
some summit since 2017 the type level

00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:26,229
summit this week will happen I have to

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,990
say thank you to Lars and type level I

00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:33,419

best person ever yes thank you

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,630
and it's happening on Friday this year

00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:49,300
this Friday

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:54,370
conference brain sorry do you have

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:57,039
installed the Scala days app yes okay if

00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,050
you did not install these Scala days at

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,030
please make sure that you have it and

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,069
that you have it at the latest version

00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:05,800
and not only that you have it at the

00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:10,120
latest version no we also want to bug

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,599
you with push notifications this is for

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,199
a lot of reasons but mainly if there is

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,770
a last-minute cancellation it's really

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,750
hard to update the website because well

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,229
it's not really hard it's quite easy but

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,130
our wonderful people who do that sit on

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,409
the west coast of the US which means 9

00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,180
hours different so if we have a change

00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,229
in the mall in

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,840
morning it's in the middle of the night

00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,310
there so it's easier to send you a push

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:45,539
notification and tell you speaker XY is

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,539
not in but speaker a B will be there so

00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,400
please make sure that you have this

00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:53,820
enable thank you very much and of course

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,610
you can find the schedule there and you

00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:01,169
can vote for the sessions this is very

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:04,620
valuable feedback from speakers it's

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:07,169
basically just just I should strike this

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,680
word out of my out of my vocabulary

00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,840

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,810
choose you have this money you have this

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,539
