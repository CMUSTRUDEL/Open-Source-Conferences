it just seems like we're approaching

00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:10,250
problems and approaching organization

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,080
the same way like and I've just seen

00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,929
this you know even with major services

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,180
people talk about you know consolidating

00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:20,180
things making them smaller and I just

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,220
see people writing these huge micro

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,820
services what are we doing can we do

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:27,529
things better so I started to wonder

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,949
what if I started to look at different

00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:32,720
structures of system for example what if

00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,239
something in chaotic systems might be

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,090
able to help us and how they might be

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:41,120
organized and some of the patterns that

00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,190
are revealed in those and this is a

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,860
picture lovely picture of the Orion

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,910
Nebula a little thing about art pulses

00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,289
and the French post-impressionist

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:58,730
painter is quoted as saying we live in a

00:00:54,289 --> 00:01:03,230
rainbow of chaos and his paintings he

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:05,149
eventually began to regardless of how

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,619
everyone around him with seeing and

00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:10,520
interpreting things he eventually

00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:12,439
started to structurally order what he

00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,490
saw around him into what he was

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:19,869
producing any-any tried to simplify

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,860
forms and the planes of color and this

00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:24,979
reinterpretation that he did eventually

00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,990
became a bridge between Impressionism

00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,619
and cubism which sparked one of the most

00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:33,320
revolutionary areas of artistic Kukui in

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:36,110
the 20th century and I thought that was

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,509
a really good way to open this talk and

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,450
here's a picture of the trapezium

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:44,119
cluster in the Orion Nebula and this is

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,670
how we saw it for a long time using the

00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,200
Hubble telescope and it you know I can't

00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,200
I keep wanting to say this looks really

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,049
nebulae but that's probably wrong but

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,439
new ways of translating what we can see

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,570
really can change everything for us and

00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:02,390
something that once looked chaotic for

00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,840
example here using the Vista infrared

00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,799
telescope a new tool that was developed

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,750
reveals that there are actually very

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,150
active young stars and the deeper dusty

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,370
regions of this cluster so it looks

00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,819
chaotic but just a different way of

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,069
viewing it we can see these

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,530
fascinating structures and all this new

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:22,510
activity going on and then there's all

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,280
this order and all these processes

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,370
happening underneath it that we didn't

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,819
know about before

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:34,599
again the Orion Nebula but here you know

00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:36,310
you see a pattern out in space and that

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,319
same pattern reflected back on earth

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,359
which i think is really fascinating

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,030
so with growing insight we recognized

00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:44,650
more patterns at all levels of scale and

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,889
that's the really important thing I

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:50,620
think learning patterns is something

00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:52,870
that humans are uniquely good at but

00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,909
getting a machine to discover new

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,209
patterns that evolve over time is

00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,709
completely different generally with

00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,939
something like machine learning we're

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,169
giving them templates that they can

00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:05,859
learn from things that are existing

00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:09,489
patterns so what comes easily to

00:03:05,859 --> 00:03:11,049
something like a scallop is really a

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,250
challenge for some of the world's

00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:18,299
largest supercomputers in pattern

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,799
recognition and with chaos it's

00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:23,829
unfortunate that we use the word chaos

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,780
to describe it because in the language

00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,439
the word chaos suggests complete

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,840
disorder and chaos is really the study

00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,750
of order within a system that exhibits

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,780
apparent randomness and the key there is

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,389
apparent randomness and what these

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,370
systems have is a sensitivity to initial

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:43,859
conditions and if you're familiar if

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,879
you've heard of the butterfly effect

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:51,519
where a small change in one state of a

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,769
deterministic nonlinear system which

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,409
these are can result in large-scale

00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:58,840
differences at a later state and this

00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:03,250
really also touches on the evolution of

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,949
systems so chaos theory focuses on

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,959
discovering the underlying patterns in

00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:11,109
these turbulent processes or erratic

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,719
behaviors or seemingly random data which

00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:13,959
I think is something that we all deal

00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,579
with

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,039
I know I've dealt with this like my

00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,209
whole career and don't worry I'm not

00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:24,060
going to be talking about chaos

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:27,460
engineering so this underlying order

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,380
gets us closer to being able to predict

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,930
and control

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,690
systems and this really has widespread

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,540
application for us and every single

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,030
domain that we deal with and then we

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,910
might be able to apply this to problems

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,220
such as climate change dealing with

00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,880
world hunger and many many other

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,700
problems so we can ask the question of

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,510
our systems does something which appears

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,880
chaotic or disordered exhibits something

00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,910
recognizable with some kind of

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:05,710
regularity in a stream of time that we

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:08,770
can observe and patterns are ubiquitous

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,650
we see them everywhere and patter

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,630
formation is pervasive in the patterns

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:16,120
that we design you know we talk about

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,710
patterns and software engineering or in

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,310
how we organize our systems and finding

00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:26,320
patterns recognized in our data sets

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:30,160
it's everywhere things done in a pattern

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,380
istic way and what's really interesting

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,490
is when we start to look at pattern

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,770
formation what do these patterns have in

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,510
common and this is to me really

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,610
fascinating they are all ways to

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,940
formulate structures that are conduits

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,670
for energy and you see this in

00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,100
biological systems you see this in one

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:55,810
more structural and massive data

00:05:51,100 --> 00:06:00,690
streaming terabytes of data cells do it

00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:03,340
everything does it this notion of of

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:06,610
conduits for energy is foundational team

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:10,420
in all of these systems so why do we

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,190
care about this in massively scalable

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,590
systems when we're dealing with

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:16,900
streaming terabytes of data per day

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:19,480
through clusters of nodes across

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:23,380
globally networked replicated systems

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,180
well when we think about this the ways

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,540
that we design these systems becomes

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:32,200
vital enable in order for them to be

00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,930
resilient and there's this prevailing

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,790
phenomenon of self-organization which I

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,760
think is also fascinating where a system

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:42,029
will spontaneously become ordered in

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,029
space and time

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:48,360
from local interactions of all of its

00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:50,659
the members or all of the units of these

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,469
systems that are networked together and

00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:56,189
self-organization theory grew out of

00:06:52,469 --> 00:07:00,240
many different areas of study computer

00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:02,930
science economics biology and these

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,689
processes are found throughout in

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,089
astrophysics and atomic physics cell

00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:14,300
biology evolutionary biology and Donette

00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:16,979
genetics and many many others so complex

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,809
I'm sorry and I wanted to talk about it

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,939
and one thing that I think is really

00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:23,339
important that we don't so much talk

00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:27,029
about in the business sector of

00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:29,729
technology is data lineage and I really

00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:32,279
like this quote any living cell carries

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:35,309
with it the experience of a billion

00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,610
years of experimentation and we try and

00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:40,919
come up with these new ideas and really

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,449
there's this whole you know tremendous

00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,550
data lineage that's been happening

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:47,039
before us that have patterns that have

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:50,219
been evolving through things like

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,749
natural selection and creating optimized

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,180
solutions for things that really we

00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:56,550
don't look at in our sector of the

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,009
industry so I'd like to I'd like us to

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,959
start looking at pattern formation

00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,930
through the lens of biological systems

00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:06,599
and see what we might be able to start

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,240
applying because living systems have

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,189
tremendous data lineage Adams

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,139
self-organized protein molecules

00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,769
self-organized in this picture is a cell

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:19,680
with handling the response to heat shock

00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:22,139
and what happens with protein molecules

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,659
and they start to self-organize and note

00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:27,990
that nothing is telling them to do that

00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,999
there's no controlling factor there's no

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,039
leader that says okay guys this is what

00:08:29,999 --> 00:08:35,399
we're going to start doing now they

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,649
regulate they optimize replicate and

00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:40,680
have been doing this for over a millions

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,750
of years and I like this quote we live

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,019
in a world which is constantly exploring

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:49,100
what's possible finding new combinations

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,990
not struggling to survive but playing

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,510
tinkering to find what's possible and

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,220
really that's what we're doing but

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,340
without you know the deadlines that we

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,620
actually have and we are part of the

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,160
experiment experimenting if you think

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,110
about it

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,570
so for situations where we don't have

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,270
the right algorithms yet for what we are

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:13,220
trying to solve we can start to look at

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,220
how nature solve that problem and

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,010
self-organization is a really

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,500
fascinating aspect of how chaotic

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,860
systems and nonlinear systems

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,770
deterministic systems behave and complex

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,320
adaptive systems again it's this

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:33,360
phenomenon of self-organization of all

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,880
the distinctive traits of this

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,760
collective behavior the most spectacular

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,810
is this emergence of good border where

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:46,280
individuals within the group or entities

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:48,480
spontaneously without any global control

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,230
synchronize their behavioral state with

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,080
each other so this is just a quick

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,880
little animated gif of penguins in

00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,500
Antarctica in the Antarctic winter and I

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,470
think that they are king penguins

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:11,700
emperor penguins sorry and them huddling

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:13,200
together yeah so this is really

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,630
fascinating and you should check out if

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,410
you're interested PBS the nature program

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:21,420
The Gathering swarms there is no leader

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,090
in these penguin groups in these little

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,300
societies they have needed to solve a

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,440
problem in their particular you know

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,530
environment that they're deployed into

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,380
and over the years they had to deal with

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:37,170
changing environmental systems and what

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,270
they've learned to do without discussing

00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,910
it without I mean they're very chatty if

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,760
you've ever seen a penguin colony but

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,060
they you know in order to conserve heat

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,550
they will rotate among themselves the

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,980
individuals will rotate towards the

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,990
center and the ones in the center will

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,410
slowly once they're warm enough rotated

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,060
out and then what happens even is the

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,590
ones that have been on the outside if

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,720
they get really really cold because it's

00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:07,710
like 70 below they will spawn off into a

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,060
new group or

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,220
the ones that were inside the other

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,410
group will start to be on the outside

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,840
and they rotate around and this is

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:20,490
self-organization no one's coordinating

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,920
this we start to see patterns of order

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,900
from disorder where a million birds in a

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,760
chaotic array will spontaneously

00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,190
assemble and appear to act and think

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,530
with one mind and the knowledge of each

00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,410
of these individuals adds together and

00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,120
helps the system make decisions to come

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,910
to a consensus which I'm going to get

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,860
into and find resources and fend off

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,750
threats and this is again stuff that we

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:51,630
all deal with with our systems that we

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:54,000
wait and deploy this is migrating geese

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,370
and contrary to what you might think

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,460
there's no leader here the one in the

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,280
front feels the drag of the wind and

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,920
when it gets tired it will just on its

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,830
own sort of move to the back and another

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,420
one that's fresher will go to the front

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:13,520
and they do this because they've learned

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,860
to optimize energy conservation and the

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,590
roles and these groups are totally fluid

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:24,000
and that is part of the strategy that

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:25,500
they've evolved for resilience I am

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,060
going to get into this significantly

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,990
because it deals with computation so

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,860
when we're dealing with big data

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:38,090
processing that we that we do do so for

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:41,310
over 130 million years of evolution to

00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:45,210
optimization algorithms across hundreds

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:49,050
of thousands of species everything has

00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:52,860
been tuned to something specific ants

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,140
alone comprise more than 14 thousand

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,380
species on the planet and they live in

00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,150
every habitat dealing with every type of

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,610
ecological problem that we could think

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:05,460
of and they've evolved solutions for

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,380
those some of them are solutions that we

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,390
we haven't even thought of and some of

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,010
them are actually protocols that we've

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,420
developed that are incredibly similar

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,480
where we developed them relatively

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,760
recently but they've developed them

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,490
millions of years ago and I think that

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,760
by looking at this we can apply those to

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,029
this

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,610
since that we're engineering schooling

00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,010
and synchrony the largest fish migration

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,320
on the planet happens along the coast of

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,529
South Africa and these are sardines

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,230
just the sheer oneness of it if you've

00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:39,060
ever seen them where all of a sudden the

00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,470
group is going one way and then in a

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,300
second they all move together as one as

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,610
individuals but they become a single

00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,810
entity with a single collective mind

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:54,420
making decisions and how do they do this

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:56,040
they have a feedback machine I'm going

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,949
to go into a little bit about that that

00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,860
allows each of them each of these unique

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:05,100
individuals to assess constantly

00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:08,970
changing input and reapply simple rules

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,600
to make decisions and swarming when you

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,360
consider a swarm one bee at a time one

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,370
unit at a time it starts to look just

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,529
like a complete heap of chaos if you

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,839
ever seen bees flying around it just

00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:23,850
looks a little bit crazy and random each

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,579
insect wanders around using its tiny

00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,160
brain and they perceive nothing more

00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:31,139
than its immediate surroundings they

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,089
don't there's nothing there's no notion

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:35,760
of what's going on in the whole of the

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:39,959
swarm yet somehow thousands make a

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,209
collective decision and these are you

00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,569
can put these all under the umbrella of

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:47,699
super organisms when entities assemble

00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:49,560
something extraordinary happens and like

00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:51,889
our engineered systems they're all

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,089
dealing with constant threats

00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,800
fluctuating resources and changing

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,079
environmental factors but super

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,690
organisms work collectively to solve

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,630
them so how do groups have unique

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,839
error-prone actors succeed and fail at

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,880
processing information together and

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,040
what's interesting is that when you

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,660
start to look at these systems of simple

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,519
actors and collective intelligence it's

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,490
incredibly if not exactly similar to how

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,199
neurons work in the brain a

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,630
superorganism behavior may not be

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,579
consciousness in the whole but may be

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:29,100
described as that because they start to

00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:31,670
work as one and I really love this quote

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,550
by Walter J field in the third

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,490
perception requires the mass action of

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,959
thousands to millions of neurons and the

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,209
reason that this really speaks to me

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,060
because I work on systems at massive

00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:49,070
scale and there's you know problems

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:53,149
become exponentially larger and I'm not

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:55,010
going to get into neural systems and the

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,779
problem with this talk is that there's

00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,430
so many different topics and there's so

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,110
many different trajectories that we

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,260
could talk about we would really need a

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,910
week to cover it all so the human brain

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,480
contains roughly a hundred billion

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,930
neurons and each one connects to

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,570
thousands of other neurons and there are

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,420
over a hundred trillion connections in

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,810
our brain so activities like thinking or

00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:23,240
nor memory are the result of countless

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,180
electrical interactions so this really

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,260
makes our brain the ultimate collective

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,420
neurons fire signals that only

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:33,529
collectively create what we call

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,810
intelligence so just like our systems

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,870
that we build with hundreds of ingestion

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,980
nodes collecting you know terabytes of

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,750
data across innumerable instances

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,110
clusters and data centers

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,300
nothing really starts to make sense

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,990
until we pull it together in some kind

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,860
of analysis of what this actually means

00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,600
given some framework of time and

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:05,630
location and then we could start to

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,699
extract behaviors from that individual

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,980
members of a swarm behave surprisingly

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,750
like neurons in the brain and of course

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,569
this is what we do deal with in

00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:17,569
distributed computations and this is not

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:19,790
happening through any global control or

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,980
distributed kind of query where in a

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,780
distributed query I might be sending out

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,900
a command and say this is what I want to

00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:29,360
know and I'm doing some kind of possibly

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,240
hashed routing to where this data lives

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,790
and I want to get as fast as I can some

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,460
specific information pull it together

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,320
analyze it and return some kind of you

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,820
know intelligence about that what's what

00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,160
does that actually mean

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,430
but simple distributed autonomous

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,810
ancient agents with innate roles are

00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,520
doing this and this is fascinating and I

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,520
want to talk a little bit about swarm

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,250
intelligence this is not exactly

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,570
something that we can apply to when

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,220
you're writing applications and

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,280
deploying them because there's a lot of

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,350
logic in there but it can apply to the

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,850
organization of these systems and that's

00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,260
what I think is really important and it

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:15,960
can absolutely apply to any kind of

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,960
massive scale compute that we're doing

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,520
for any of us that do that kind of work

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,340
so swarm intelligence is really doing

00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:27,120
this at solving this but I noticed that

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:31,230
and I really noticed this swarm is

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,300
highly misunderstood in the business

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,040
sector when people are really just

00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,360
marketing things you know taggi Anna's

00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,640
like oh this is swarm and then

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,410
underneath it's actually raft and

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,570
they're doing leader election and this

00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:44,670
is not what swarm intelligence is about

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,550
organizationally every single

00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:51,030
implementation I've seen and there's

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:54,270
this convergence between neurons bees

00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,680
ants and a numeral different and many

00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,360
different types of collective

00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,740
organizations that can teach us about

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,410
how we design networks clusters Network

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,620
logic as well as designing intelligence

00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:11,400
swarms ourselves so how do real swarms

00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:14,010
do this and I'm going to talk a bit

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,110
about theory and the properties of these

00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,120
and then I want to get into some

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,720
specific examples so you can sort of

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,670
hang context onto all of this and start

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,410
to think about how you might be able to

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,440
do some kind of takeaway for yourself

00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,510
and the work that you do so this talk is

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,550
really focusing on self organized

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,560
systems in the whole chain of complex

00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,470
systems and non-determinism etc and

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:39,540
there are many autonomous entities that

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,420
will self assemble into emergent

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:45,210
patterns specifically to solve problems

00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,670
and that's why I wanted to tag this with

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,990
a biological spin because over time

00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:51,810
that's what they're doing they're

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,710
expensive experimenting they're evolving

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:56,480
and we really can take advantage of that

00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,090
and they're doing all of this with no

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,460
global coordination at all and these

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:04,940
global level patterns that emerge are

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,190
unpredictable from the behaviors of each

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,779
of the units so if you look at the

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,140
simplicity of what each of these

00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:14,240
individual agents are doing and all the

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,090
constraints that they have you can never

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,220
looking at that glean from that what the

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,260
group as a whole in these emergent

00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,360
patters of self-organization and

00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:26,600
self-assembly are going to do and that's

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,940
where it's really interesting an

00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,429
emergent and this emerges solely from

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,980
these numerous interactions between the

00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:37,490
individuals and swarm intelligence is

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:41,419
really a perfect example of this so we

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:43,250
have autonomy many different agents

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:45,010
networked together it's simplistic I'm

00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:47,450
going to get into that in a second

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:49,549
decentralization which I'm most going to

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,399
talk about no leader no supervisor no

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:55,360
global coordination spontaneous

00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:57,770
self-assembly for order where previously

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,350
their networked they're communicating

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:02,090
like crazy but there's no implicit

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,770
organization that happens until they

00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,049
spontaneously do this there's some kind

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:08,510
of trigger and then system level

00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,399
patterns are predictable to looking at

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,049
the unit's themselves and then an

00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,610
eventual group intelligence and

00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:17,090
capabilities that we get from these

00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:21,409
systems that far exceed the capability

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:23,809
of the individuals so decentralization

00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:26,179
we hear this a lot particularly with

00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:30,230
things like blockchain decentralization

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:32,289
when we talk about it it's a lot of what

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,390
I see people and here people are really

00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:36,830
misunderstanding decentralization

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,799
because I want to throw you know some

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:44,480
kind of leader or something that's

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:46,520
organizing underneath all of it and it's

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,700
one of the organizational undercurrents

00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,710
inherent to self-organized systems one

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,230
of the most important building blocks of

00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,990
collective intelligence and the least

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,140
understood and it's been evolving for

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,240
millions of years this is not some new

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:06,440
thing that we've recently thought about

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,590
from various sectors so instead of being

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,340
tied to some kind

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,740
master clock or leader each node each

00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:16,110
simplified unit acts independently and

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,059
there's a way that a whole other system

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,580
and at a different scale this is why I

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:23,250
wanted to show the Orion Nebula with

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,890
this pattern of a spiral and back on

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,799
earth there's a spiral pattern in a

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,110
nautilus shell and if you're familiar I

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,570
don't know if any of you are you know

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:38,960
math people the concept of fractals and

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:41,669
chaos really ties in here and we see a

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,159
big organizational difference when we

00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:46,559
think of even our teams our companies

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,789
and how they're organized we're even on

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,380
small teams and orgs within companies in

00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:53,669
one area you'll know about something

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,770
you'll know what's going on you'll know

00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,690
what the constraints are whereas another

00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,399
team you work with they might know or

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,039
you might have a manager that's managing

00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:03,659
multiple teams and it's really only the

00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,270
people on those teams that know exactly

00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:09,899
what's going on in those situations so

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:12,720
the concept of everything bubbling up to

00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:17,250
some kind of corny or leader it actually

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,890
takes a lot of energy to do this and you

00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:22,950
have to question the accuracy of it

00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,570
so when information is very distributed

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,399
across an org doesn't really make sense

00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:31,820
to have power so concentrated and in

00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:34,649
these systems there's no one in charge

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,440
and again you see this from you know

00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:40,100
neurons on the brain bees and hives it's

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,539
all over the place cells in the body

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,450
cells organizing into organisms

00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:48,570
themselves and there's no notion someone

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,120
recently I want to here ask me about

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,549
like isn't this kind of like Rocco but

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,130
it's really not there's no notion of

00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:58,710
membership in a local group there's

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,169
nothing managing when nodes join or

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,730
leaves there's no common bootstrap

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:04,620
that's happening in these systems a

00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,539
group conformed with a minimum number of

00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:10,260
members which for example alkyl cluster

00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:12,240
has but entities can just spawn off at

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,970
any time and start their own which they

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,080
do for specific reasons as conditions

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:20,790
change and there's no notion of an elect

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,580
an elect event with regard to a leader

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:26,250
but individuals do vote which I'm going

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:31,380
to talk about with regard to consensus

00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:33,420
and decide on ideas and the root

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,910
organization of this is an autonomous

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,340
agent or a compute agent which and we're

00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:40,620
going to talk about two so everything

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,830
from air molecules and weather systems

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,010
to bees in a swarm hundreds of thousands

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:49,110
of entities with the absolute freedom to

00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,170
make any number of choices about what

00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,750
they perceive what is reality what

00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,750
they've gone off and discovered and

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,580
where to go next at any given moment

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,890
making incredibly fast decisions and

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,570
communicating them to their local sphere

00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,160
they're not distributing that

00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,200
information or reporting it up to

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,570
something that's collecting it but

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,920
autonomous agents don't exist in pure

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,960
chaos behavior is really governed by

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,420
applying simple rules as necessary and

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,570
very often they apply simple rules and

00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:26,820
do this iteratively until some process

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:29,400
has been completed and these are very

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,980
very chatty networks these are simple

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,320
organisms they're constantly needing to

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,720
talk to each other for example with fish

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,090
they need to talk to each other and

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,680
communicate through signals I need to

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:43,950
move really quickly I don't want to get

00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,390
too close to you or ants I want to you

00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,820
know go in a certain direction

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,590
there's something over here where are we

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,650
seeing this I need to make a decision

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,810
very quickly and it really strikes me as

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:57,480
something that's kind of like contagion

00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:59,760
theory information spreading from node

00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,970
to node virally as it all happens very

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,980
fast rippling through the group so how

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,830
does something that spreads or doesn't

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,590
spread over hundreds to thousands of

00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,120
unique nodes happen and these are not

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,580
clones I think that's important to

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,720
specify that these are all unique

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:21,150
entities together nothing is broadcast

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,720
to all nodes it's a very quick sort of

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:27,150
meta signal through the graph and if one

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,570
of them if one of the signals is dropped

00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:32,790
it's fine nothing is lost and I'm going

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,050
to get a bit into not quite

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,800
fault-tolerant

00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:40,020
but resilience in these systems so

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,270
there's the notion of how infectious is

00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:45,090
this given phenomena that spreads

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,400
through our network and the topology and

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,200
how these elements are assessing the

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,830
topology and where they fit in it and

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,400
how they can leverage it and what

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,320
they're doing is regular continual

00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,380
interactions and computation again very

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,730
very noisy networks amplification when

00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,380
there's something to discuss or

00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,870
something to distribute to its nearest

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,670
neighbor or peers and then eventually

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,830
what happens when they go through the

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:13,320
process of consensus on something there

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,810
as a collectively trying to decide

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,990
there's this amazing eventual

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:20,520
synchronization of state which I find

00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:24,000
fascinating because again there's no

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:27,320
control so swarm algorithms are really

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,480
interesting swarm intelligence

00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,040
algorithms the strategies have some

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,500
similar properties and they have to be

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,220
distributed which really really applies

00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,630
to the work that we do they have to be

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,430
decentralized in order to function

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,610
properly and be incredibly fast and

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:48,570
fault tolerant they are adaptive which I

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:51,420
think is something that is sadly missing

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,850
in the systems that we're designing I

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,000
mean we talk about machine learning we

00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:00,470
talk about analytics and getting

00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,750
information from things and reporting

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:06,630
monitoring but I have noticed in the

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,580
last 10 years and I haven't had any time

00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,790
to work on this but someone should that

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:13,290
some kind of kernel of intelligence some

00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,930
kind of learning about in the

00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:18,570
infrastructure layer no matter what the

00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,130
domain is needs to have some of these

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:22,050
properties I'm going to highlight what

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:25,440
some of these properties are as I as I

00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:28,920
hit them in the talk but some of the

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,310
detailed examples I list just you know a

00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,140
few of some of the higher-level swarm

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,120
algorithms but these are really

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,730
fascinating and there's like hundreds of

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,010
these if you read the papers and I think

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,050
I read like 100 scientific papers on a

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,890
lot of this information and then like

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,890
the last couple months

00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,800
so things I just want to call out

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,330
because I think a lot of you working in

00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,570
big data or otherwise or if you have a

00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,430
math or physics background well these

00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,970
will resonate for you like particle

00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:03,180
swarm optimization this is inspired with

00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:06,480
regard to swarm intelligence and swarm

00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:09,660
algorithms by flocking behaviors

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,230
schooling behaviors and herding ants

00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:16,440
there's so many different kind of

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,360
strategies than ants can teach us the

00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,020
primary one that we get from them is

00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,090
various kinds of optimization and that's

00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,760
search distributed search finding good

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:28,680
paths intelligent routing through

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,730
systems working through graphs

00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:35,280
distributed graphs bees for optimizing

00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:38,040
in continuous multi variable functions

00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,490
they are incredibly used towards

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:44,520
robotics distributed robotics solutions

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:47,340
networks vehicle routing image analysis

00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,440
data mining genetic algorithms and

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,900
training of artificial neural networks

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,830
so I mean and this is just really only

00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:58,050
some so when many of the relevant

00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,570
algorithm results were compared and this

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,850
is interesting results showed that with

00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:06,120
this a B it's the ABC algorithm the

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:08,070
artificial bee colony there were several

00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,800
different that were related and when

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:14,550
they were all compared on which ones

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:17,520
were the most efficient the scientific

00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:19,740
results showed that the ABC outperformed

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,140
all the other algorithms and you really

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:26,760
see this people are really finding this

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,770
all across this domain and so we can

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,600
really start to look at those and apply

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,180
them to these systems that we're

00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:35,310
building and and how we're constructing

00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,970
our networks and our clusters even our

00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:42,180
our applications it's really fascinating

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:44,790
so what actually is a computational

00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:47,370
agent I think I talked about autonomous

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:51,210
agents but there's another more

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,960
specified level to that and all of these

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:55,800
again are very similar between

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,260
computational agents when we think about

00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,860
neurons the behavior

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,290
bees the behavior of ants and they are

00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,059
simple networked entities which

00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:09,059
collectively have been solving problems

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,070
of distributed distribution for millions

00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:12,780
of years and this is another thing that

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,600
why aren't we looking at these in our

00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:17,190
sector of the industry more

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:20,549
computationally speaking though each

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,070
agent has very limited capabilities and

00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:25,470
they lack the capacity alone to make the

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,960
kind of decisions that need to be made

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,720
for survivability in their environments

00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,350
but when they come together they self

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,880
organize they make decisions and that's

00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,840
when everything comes together for them

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,650
to make complex decisions for the group

00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,360
so I'm going to read this slide that

00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:45,030
they have limited capabilities and

00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,820
intelligence governed by a very simple

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,429
set of rules and these are the rules

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:53,460
that give them the criteria in which

00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:55,559
they decide things with and it's been

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,620
observed but not proved yet that these

00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:01,470
criteria might be weighted but they have

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,419
priorities and they share information

00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:05,910
with their nearest neighbor that

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,700
reporting up to someone and they

00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:11,280
communicate very often and only through

00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:20,580
incredibly be brief efficient

00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:23,280
interactions eats water dies sorry so

00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,700
these are basically computers embedded

00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:29,100
in nature and you know incredible

00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,330
survivability all through working

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,240
through what they've learned through

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:36,510
evolution trial and error

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,720
experimentation so for around 130

00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:42,330
million years evolutionist tuned ant and

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,570
bee colony algorithms to near optimal

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:48,000
efficiency and that sort of begs the

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,510
question to us what have they optimized

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,760
for not this time and if you think about

00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,309
it you know this is very applicable

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,640
quote our computers our electricity

00:32:56,309 --> 00:33:02,220
guzzling machines the bee however is

00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,520
doing fairly high-level cognitive tasks

00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:07,110
with a tiny drop of nectar and their

00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,750
brains are probably processing

00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,790
information and very clever way and

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,320
there's

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:15,530
definitely thinks that we can learn and

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,040
how to even construct the computers that

00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:21,430
we use based on looking at these simple

00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,080
systems that work together in a network

00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:25,760
so can destructing how with the beasts

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,810
compute help design more efficient

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:33,680
computers and the organization of the

00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:37,310
bee colonies are composed of a queen and

00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,870
several thousand workers and really the

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,010
queen does not make decisions for the

00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,680
hive at all

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,050
the hive is always making decisions for

00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,000
her and it's remarkable that all of

00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,860
these tasks did not depend in any way on

00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,710
any kind of central control but they're

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,460
achieved only by using these principles

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:56,900
of self-organization and some of the

00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,450
things that they do are maintaining

00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,640
constant temperature in their hive which

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,880
just sounds incredible given that their

00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:07,600
beats keeping track of changing foraging

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,010
conditions and ants do these as well and

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,210
selecting the best possible nest site

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:15,679
which I am going to explain and

00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,410
selecting the best possible nest nest

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,080
site this is really a life-or-death

00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:23,890
situation for bees when they need to

00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,510
leave their hive usually it's because

00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:29,179
you know incredible degradation they

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,980
really only have three somewhere around

00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:34,640
three days to find a new nest site

00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:37,820
before they die so over time they've

00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:40,160
become incredibly efficient at how they

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,840
go you know the algorithms behind how

00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,600
they go about their search for this and

00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,710
then how they these simple organisms go

00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:53,870
about deciding together what to do next

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:56,840
so scout bees make up about 3% of the

00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,330
population of a single hive and there

00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:02,210
might be around 50 Scouts that fly off

00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,990
in all directions several different

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,090
miles sometimes depending up to several

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,820
kilometres to search for candidate

00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:13,280
locations and when a scout find one

00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,780
finds one and again they have specific

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,060
criteria they're looking for you know

00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,540
size of it is there anything around it

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:23,330
how can they handle any kind of threats

00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:24,900
there's actually quite a big list of

00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:29,529
what they need to

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:31,329
look for in a candidate must they will

00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:33,160
go out and then they will return if

00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:36,609
they've found something they think is a

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:38,230
viable solution and really the cool

00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:40,299
thing about what they do is they don't

00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:44,079
and this has been incredibly researched

00:35:40,299 --> 00:35:48,220
I'm not like surmising it although it

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,799
sounds like I am they don't propose it

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:53,589
as though the way that you know humans

00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:55,359
would do like if you think about think

00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:57,130
about the last couple meetings you had

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,020
with your team or with you know cross

00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:02,140
with another team when you're discussing

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,660
what to do what the bees will do is

00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,390
they'll gather information on something

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,940
come back to the collective and they'll

00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,829
say well I I found out this thing I

00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,829
think it might be a good idea but you

00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:16,690
know they're not attached to it they're

00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:18,369
not trying to impose it on anyone and

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:21,420
they're just doing it very collectively

00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:24,240
trying to just sort of amass this

00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,920
information with which all of them

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,440
without any leader can make a decision

00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,089
about and so they communicate the

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,180
potential site information through

00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:35,740
visual signals and they do this through

00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,049
it's kind of a funny name it's called

00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,809
the waggle dance their body sort of

00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:43,630
Wiggles around and this allows them in

00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:46,960
this dance that they do they encode a

00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:51,220
lot of the information about what what

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,160
they've found and how to recruit other

00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,069
bees other Scouts to possibly go check

00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:01,119
this out and they do this kind of figure

00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:02,950
eight where they go around and then as

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,930
they come back into the center of this

00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:08,470
figure eight pattern that's when they do

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:10,660
the sort of waggle dance aspect and what

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:14,950
they do is encode into that the

00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:18,690
direction and the distance to that site

00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:21,579
and the duration that they do this dance

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:24,130
directly correlates to how excited they

00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,529
are about this possible solution like do

00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,380
they how viable they think this might be

00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:30,849
for the group and it's really it's only

00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,099
seen it's not like they're in some

00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:34,809
theater where everyone's watching them

00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:36,580
and getting this information together

00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:38,320
it's really just you know they

00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,330
back they'll and they do their little

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,220
dance and it's only the ones that are

00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,340
around them and they're doing and the

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,920
thing is you know if you look at videos

00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:51,130
of how it's been researched you know

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,650
there might be 10 or 20 potential sites

00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:56,410
that come back and they're all you know

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,690
several dancers are going on by Scout

00:37:56,410 --> 00:38:01,270
bees and they need to sort of correlate

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:04,150
all of this in their brain of these very

00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:09,150
simple individuals it's fascinating and

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:11,830
I have a video so decisions are faster

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,050
and this pertains across the board not

00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,880
just bees decisions have been found to

00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:18,370
be faster when choices are of higher

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,570
quality and this happens in our brains

00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,060
as well

00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,460
so besides distance and directions to a

00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,530
resource the bee is encoding its quality

00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,680
as a weighted factor based on the

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:32,440
criteria and the duration depends on how

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,290
enthused enthusiastic they are so within

00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:39,040
seconds after reaching the group

00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:42,340
consensus and they tend to have what's

00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,440
been found to be a quorum of roughly

00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,750
depending of course on the size of the

00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,070
hive death how many entities are in this

00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:53,530
system 15 to 30 need to agree before

00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:57,130
they will just say okay closing up shop

00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:59,650
we're going to everyone get ready to fly

00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,960
you know they they don't proceed anymore

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,990
they just say the first one wins that

00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,790
meets this quorum threshold and then

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,200
they take off because they've got to do

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:14,440
this all very quickly it's um currently

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:17,470
important to them so this is what the

00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,630
waggle dance looks like and I picked the

00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,970
one that kind of was slowed down so you

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,130
could sort of see this guy going in the

00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:25,690
figure eight doing the waggle dance and

00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,270
the direction that they're going is

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,690
pointing to the particular available

00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,690
resource

00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:40,350
so amps and algorithms have to be simple

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:43,230
distributed and scalable the very

00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,330
qualities that we need in a large

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:47,280
engineered system and this is a quote by

00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,470
Deborah Gordon who's a really famous

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,600
biologist at Stanford and she's been

00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:55,650
studying and populations around the

00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,940
world for over 30 years she's had she

00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,850
has several TED Talks that I really

00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:03,480
recommend if you're interested in how

00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:07,290
things organized and really when you

00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,780
start by looking at organization by

00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,850
looking at bees you're starting at the

00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,550
beginning of evolution because bees

00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,950
sorry ants have been around for so long

00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:20,610
and ants use algorithms that humans

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:22,619
began using relatively recently only

00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:24,780
the ants have been using them for

00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,490
millions of years and then colony

00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,280
optimization algorithms have been

00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:32,040
applied to many many combinatorial

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,619
optimization problems from quadratic

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,130
assignment to congestion minimization or

00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:40,109
routing of vehicles and it has also been

00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,600
used to produce near optimal solutions

00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:44,460
for the Traveling Salesman problem and

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,140
this is something that when people talk

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,760
about ant optimization they really talk

00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:56,070
about the TSP paraffin so what do you

00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:58,350
think what is this chaos or pattern it

00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,000
kind of looks chaotic if you were to

00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:03,810
listen to the sound of an ant colony

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,109
going about its daily movements in their

00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:09,869
colony or if you can see the map

00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:12,180
movements over time by video or even

00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:14,100
hear them people have recorded the sound

00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,810
of ants moving around their colony with

00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:24,260
tiny tiny recorders collecting the sound

00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:27,150
it really does sound very chaotic and

00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:32,070
the world's largest ant colony stretches

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:35,130
over 2.7 kilometers 670 occurs and

00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:39,350
contains approximately 306 million

00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:42,810
workers with 1 million Queens across

00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:47,030
45,000 interconnected nests and this is

00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:50,090
an example of what a superorganism

00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:55,310
or super colony so you can really think

00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:58,850
about this as 307 million nodes 45,000

00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:00,440
deployed clusters 1 million replicators

00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:04,570
not replicants

00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:09,050
but things units able to replicate

00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:13,400
clusters these are very massive systems

00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:16,490
at scale and sub super colonies succeed

00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,790
in part this is very important because

00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:21,650
no one is in charge and member members

00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,660
communicate in these systems through

00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:26,390
algorithmic patterns which help them

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:29,690
survive as a whole and what they're

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:33,280
actually doing is this image is just a

00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:37,250
snapshot from a video of seeing ants

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,990
moving their army ants so there again

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,760
every species of ants in every different

00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,350
environment is solving different

00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,490
problems and this is congestion

00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:48,640
avoidance optimization where army ants

00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:51,830
have evolved a three-lane traffic system

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,480
simulations show mathematic simulations

00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,460
show that the pattern minimizes

00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,370
congestion and maximizes flow of the

00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:01,370
resource to storage and utilization and

00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:05,480
these traffic systems achieve a max low

00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:09,320
of 200000 outbound in the stream and can

00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:11,960
return carrying an additional 30,000

00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,910
units of cargo a day and I don't know if

00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,130
you've ever seen you know a video of

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,710
ants there ants are really strong for

00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:20,750
their size and they will often carry a

00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,670
load this makes me think of you know

00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,980
data loads and the size of packets and

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:28,220
all of the chaos that comes from that

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:32,140
that we deal with it's you know 10 times

00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,140
larger than their actual body

00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,050
yeah hundreds of thousands of travelers

00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,430
speed along densely packed highways

00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:45,099
because that's what they actually create

00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:48,400
are these transportation highways with

00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:50,020
huge loads but without congestion and if

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,290
you think about a lot of the traffic

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,630
patterns in areas of the world humid

00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:59,550
traffic patterns we have a lot of

00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:02,260
congestion all the time and they do not

00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:03,099
so how do they exchange information to

00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,530
make decisions

00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,960
well colonies of ants have sterile

00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:10,990
female workers one or more reproductive

00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:15,040
females and males that simply mate with

00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,900
future queens and died soon after and in

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,490
most species a lot of the ants can

00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:23,140
barely see they operate mostly by smell

00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:27,010
so a meeting for an ant unlike our

00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:29,109
meetings it's just a quick touch of the

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:30,819
antennae so they can smell they they or

00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:32,650
they leave pheromones which are not

00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:34,810
long-lived so that the information that

00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:37,390
you clean from gathering the pheromone

00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:39,010
it's not something that's going to have

00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:41,740
a lot of lace in latency it's going to

00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:45,010
be pretty recent information and they do

00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:46,420
this to identify who is my nest mate and

00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,329
what tasks of you what have you been

00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,369
recently doing and so each ant just has

00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:53,670
to keep track of its recent recent

00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:57,160
experience to decide what to do next and

00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:59,230
one algorithm that we work with which

00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,720
was invented in the early stages of the

00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:04,060
internet that we all use because

00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,819
operating costs were high and its goal

00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,770
was managing data congestion by gate

00:45:06,819 --> 00:45:12,339
gauging bandwidth availability and this

00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:14,349
is really similar to one that evolved by

00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:18,220
desert ants to gauge resource scarcity

00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:21,700
millions of years ago foraging strategy

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:24,310
of harvester ants evolved they evolved

00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,260
an algorithm to conserve water in the

00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:28,599
desert they have to spend it to get it

00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:31,510
so when the most prescient precious

00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:33,339
resource is scarce the algorithm that

00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,540
regulates flow evolved towards

00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:39,609
minimizing operating costs rather than

00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:42,670
maximizing current accumulation of that

00:45:39,609 --> 00:45:45,520
resource and they collectively somehow

00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,880
regulate the trade-off between spending

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,790
that resource in order to get more

00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,860
and colonies do this they have been

00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:56,490
shown the colonies that do do this

00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:58,680
strategy have been shown in many many

00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:01,170
studies to be much more successful and

00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,600
this is definitely something that's a

00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,010
sustainable strategy that for any system

00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,250
where it's essential to achieve

00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:10,170
long-term liability and avoid wasted

00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:14,070
time and resources energy and energy

00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:16,200
that they can use themselves and I want

00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,790
to read this just really quick so when

00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,350
an ant forages and the Sun it loses

00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,960
water and it gets back the water from

00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:24,450
that resource said it's going to get and

00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,660
that would be for just wait at a narrow

00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:30,750
entrance to the tunnel and when are

00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,610
returning only one ant that's been out

00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,710
foraging that successfully returns sort

00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:38,190
of part of the positive feedback loop of

00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:40,380
that it will drop the load and briefly

00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:43,470
touch some of the answer round it to let

00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:47,790
them know I was out doing this task and

00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:50,220
this has been successful and there's a

00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:52,560
reason why all they pay attention to is

00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:55,320
the rate they don't pay attention to as

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,320
bees would the location of these

00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:01,110
resources so the search pattern

00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,940
optimization is quite different so when

00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:05,160
one ant meets another it doesn't matter

00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,230
which ant me it meets it doesn't there's

00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,540
no ordering in these systems that point

00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,280
matters they're not transmitting any

00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,740
kind of complicated signal to each other

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,570
the only thing that matters is the rate

00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,960
of the interactions the positive

00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:22,530
feedback and they didn't just solve

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,790
distributed search they optimized it so

00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,190
there's something to be learned about

00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,340
very large dynamical systems that we

00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:35,700
engineer by focusing on the patterns and

00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:37,560
interactions rather than the content TCP

00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,650
so obviously that's what I was talking

00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,990
about that we developed recently but the

00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:46,770
ants had evolved something very similar

00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:48,810
to this millions of years ago so what a

00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:51,720
forager will do for that three initial

00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:53,880
three-way handshake is the simple

00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:56,190
feedback system and again just as a

00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,080
neuron will add up its stimulation from

00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:59,550
other neurons to decide whether to fire

00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,680
each ant adds

00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:03,660
it's positive feedback from interactions

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,630
to decide whether or not to go out and

00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:09,600
forage and it again it has this is a

00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,850
theme they have some kind of quorum

00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,190
number that they if you have a certain

00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,140
amount of positive feedback interactions

00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:21,090
then they will go forth and do a

00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:23,850
particular task tcp slow-start gauging

00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:26,300
bandwidth and elastic scaling so a

00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:29,490
source sends out a large wave packet and

00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,940
in the beginning to gauge the bandwidth

00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:35,160
and Forster ants foraging ants send out

00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,360
a scout to gauge food availability

00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:42,390
before they go and autoscale up or down

00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:45,119
with the rate of outgoing foragers and a

00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,980
timeout and ant doesn't leave the nest

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,230
until it's met enough ants returning

00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,360
with food so once it's out a forager

00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:53,430
won't return until it collects some food

00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,710
and the system will stay stopped

00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:00,330
unless something positive happens in the

00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,550
system and I want to talk a little bit

00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:06,930
about smart swarms again we could

00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:08,460
probably spend all day on this it's kind

00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:10,140
of frustrating doing this Scott talk as

00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,869
I kept going down these avenues that

00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,490
were like oh that's so cool and then you

00:49:12,869 --> 00:49:19,830
know originally this talk was like 100

00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:21,540
slides now it's 50 so with smart swarms

00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:24,060
that's exactly what we've been doing the

00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:25,740
ability to create and program large

00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:28,920
autonomous worms which can achieve

00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:31,380
complex global behavior from cooperation

00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:35,250
of many limited and noisy individuals

00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:39,210
and in Harvard in the I can't remember

00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:41,510
the name of the lab they are doing a lot

00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:45,240
of robotics distributed robotics

00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:47,130
research just so just as trillions of

00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:50,100
individual cells can assemble into

00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:52,619
intelligent organisms they're developed

00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,960
kilobots warm demonstrates how complex

00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:58,020
group behaviors can arise from simple

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,580
units so instead of the concept you know

00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:03,570
when we think of robots we think of one

00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:05,630
highly complex robots what they are

00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:07,890
doing in this type of research is

00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:10,770
thousands of machines that collaborate

00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:13,070
providing a simple platform creating and

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:14,600
testing these complex behaviors and

00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:17,870
the value of that is of course so that

00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,660
we can take these tests and try and push

00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:22,520
how we can develop them in our

00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:25,790
understanding of them so the question

00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,100
then for Aoi becomes what are the rules

00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:33,830
of engagement that lead to this kind of

00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:35,150
intelligence and this of the kilobots

00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:40,250
that kind of what does that remind you

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:41,660
of the penguins so what they had to do

00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,430
if you think about it you know they had

00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,870
to program all these things and this is

00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:49,850
just the movement there are some of them

00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:51,620
that have a program to build and you

00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,300
know you think that it's going to be

00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:57,410
really easy but actually it's been very

00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:59,300
hard for the researchers to program for

00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:02,870
this swarm you know if you're dealing

00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,400
with like one or ten but when it becomes

00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,890
an incredibly different problem when

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,180
you've got I think now they have a swarm

00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:18,560
of a thousand 24 kilobots together

00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:21,560
working as an artificial colony so you

00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,420
can program what it does it also needs

00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,340
to be able to communicate to its nearest

00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,920
neighbors understand its relationship

00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:31,250
and current place in this local no

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,260
topology you can program what its rules

00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:36,130
of engagement are with other other

00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:39,110
elements they need to be able to

00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,730
understand and execute spontaneous

00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:44,360
synchronization some kind of tape

00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:46,310
contagion in their behavior not one of

00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,740
them is doing any specific goal

00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:50,150
perfectly well which sort of takes the

00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,460
pressure off but together

00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:55,880
collaboratively the group is able to do

00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:57,440
something much more significant and I

00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,330
think originally it was really hard for

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,000
them to get started with the project

00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:06,230
because of you know they were very

00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,510
expensive to build initially but the

00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:12,590
beauty of biological systems this is a

00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:17,420
quote from the lead professor over this

00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:18,890
product project at hereness for Harvard

00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,110
University's Wyss Institute for

00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,580
biologically inspired engineering if

00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,170
you're not familiar with them definitely

00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,600
check them out very very cool stuff

00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,580
happening

00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,920
you stopped noticing what the

00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:32,410
individuals are doing in systems like

00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,350
this and you start to only see the whole

00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,930
so in terms of scalability if every

00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:39,790
agent is following the same set of rules

00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:42,250
which is what everything I've been

00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:45,070
talking about is doing your code that

00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:47,470
runs in these systems exactly the same

00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:49,270
whether you have 10 or 10,000 agents but

00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:53,860
there are definitely some roadblocks

00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:56,530
that they ran into it represents what

00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,110
they're doing a significant milestone in

00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:01,750
the development of collective artificial

00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:04,780
intelligence because previous

00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:07,000
algorithmic limitations coordinating

00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,580
such large large numbers previously they

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,420
had been you know maybe groups had

00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:15,040
gotten like a hundred swarm of robots

00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,300
different kinds of robots but this is

00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,630
the first one that was actually

00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:22,510
successfully able to get over a thousand

00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,670
and they overcame the limitations with

00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,110
they finally realized what that what it

00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:29,050
was that they could tweak in the

00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:32,680
algorithm in their design and what they

00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:34,810
did was requiring no micromanagement no

00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,320
intervention once the initial set of

00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:40,510
instructions was delivered and so that

00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:42,400
decentralization was the pin that

00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:44,320
allowed them to go forward with this

00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,020
type of design and I think that's really

00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:48,310
critical and this was what allowed

00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:53,410
thousands of robots to perform in

00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:55,660
synchrony what do you guys see in that I

00:53:53,410 --> 00:54:01,150
had to add a little lambda on there on

00:53:55,660 --> 00:54:03,340
that little bot so in AI algorithms at

00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:06,160
scale you know obviously increasingly

00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,650
we're going to see more of these and you

00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,600
know everyone's talking about

00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:13,390
self-driving cars but I think we're good

00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,150
to see larger numbers of simpler robots

00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:17,680
working together at massive scale

00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:19,180
whether it's hundreds cooperating to

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,510
achieve some kind of environmental

00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,160
cleanup or quick Disaster Response or

00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:27,490
millions of self-driving cars on the

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:29,560
highway the thing that we can learn from

00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:31,960
that is understanding while we're

00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:35,800
studying these systems how to design

00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:38,060
good systems at scale and so for now the

00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:46,640
kilobots provide that really

00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:49,130
testbed for AI algorithms so how do we

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,720
find with all this information the

00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,880
signals in the noise and this is I love

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,790
this quote by EO Wilson who is a

00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,020
biological ant researcher very famous we

00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:59,870
are drowning in information while

00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:02,120
starving for wisdom and chaos theory has

00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:04,340
proven that there is order within

00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,680
systems where we had assumed more random

00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,150
and chaotic and this leads us to

00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,000
discover more patterns within these

00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:13,850
systems and how far humans can grasp for

00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,860
hidden order and chaotic events but it's

00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,480
not a simple leap from knowing that

00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,610
there may be a pattern to actually being

00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,650
able to discover what that pattern is in

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,860
the chaos

00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:26,870
and some of the just a quick some of the

00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:31,010
stuff to consolidate what I've talked

00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:33,500
about flexible roles decentralization no

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:36,500
leader no reporting to one particular

00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:39,560
unit nothing knows everything that's

00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:41,540
going on distributed consensus simple

00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:45,040
rules and instructions for the agents

00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:47,330
local interactions and feedback loops

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,020
self-organizing and super coordinators

00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:52,790
and just two more things I have to

00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,390
mention about reliability and resist

00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:58,790
resilience in these systems we all are

00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:01,940
searching for ways to ensure reliability

00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:04,150
in our networks at scale and system

00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:07,280
resilience is a function of

00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:12,310
decentralization and decentralized

00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,810
systems are more inexpensive to attack

00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:18,560
overly engineered systems that are

00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:20,420
primarily what I see deployed out into

00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,540
the systems for every company I've

00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,980
worked at they might seem like what we

00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,980
would call an elegant system they might

00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:30,260
seem like a good idea but the robustness

00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:33,980
of a swarm out of the algorithm shows

00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:35,840
that tolerating imperfection can overall

00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,120
lead to better solutions without

00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:42,860
attempting to set up any kind of central

00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:46,910
authority that regulates the events and

00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:49,140
a single neuron is like a bee or a scout

00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:53,220
the capacity of the collectives to

00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:55,140
is very quick there's strategies that

00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:58,319
allow them to move through roadblocks

00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,869
when they encounter them or have or be

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,950
able to rapidly exploit some of the

00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:07,470
decisions that they need to make and

00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:10,200
we'll get in with this really awesome

00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:11,910
quote by Buckminster Fuller you never

00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,150
change things by fighting the existing

00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:16,980
reality to change something build a new

00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:20,369
model that makes the existing model

00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:22,440
obsolete and if you have any questions

00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:26,869
please come find me I'll be around all
