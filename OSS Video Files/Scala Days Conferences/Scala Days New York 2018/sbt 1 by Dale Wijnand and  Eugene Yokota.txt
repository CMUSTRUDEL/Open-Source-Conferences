	00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,940
oh thanks everyone for coming

00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:14,460
oh this is going to be a session about

00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:17,590
SPT one so who are these guys

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,100
my name is Eugene I work for light been

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:23,380
tooling team as a tech lead and one of

00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:29,470
my responsibilities is maintenance of

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:32,650
SPT I've been doing that since SPT 0.13

00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,559
dot two ish so maybe the last like you

00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,960
all three four years I think I think in

00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,110
terms of like a version number thirteen

00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,570
five wasn't one of the major ones yeah

00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,300
and I'm Dale winand I work with Eugene

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:52,149
on a tooling team and I bend and

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:55,360
primarily work on SPT so the just

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:57,250
conical before the talk one of the

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,140
things like I guess randomly added this

00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,969
slide I don't even remember when but the

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,119
I just want to advertise this thing core

00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:07,690
SPT by example this is a long page

00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:11,350
introduction to SPT that takes you from

00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,640
pretty much like zero all the way to you

00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,970
know making like a darker eyes

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,939
application like running and into like a

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,729
single page without any explanation of

00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:23,439
like a detail explanation the how SPT

00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,650
works but just like you just takes you

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,720
through the quick tour so you know I

00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:32,140
think this is one of the good like a

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,659
first step into learning SPT just to see

00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,040
what it does so if someone's saying oh

00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,810
you know I want to learn a sweetie and

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,460
it's too complicated or something like

00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,960
that I think this is a good entry point

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,790
to kind of show to your friends or

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,610
something or something learn new you

00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,530
learned at the Scala days so quick your

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:52,869
you know she'll fail to this SPT by

00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:55,479
example so just quick show Vance or how

00:01:52,869 --> 00:02:00,729
many of you guys have been to Japan

00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:03,909
before okay and how many of you been to

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,380
Kyoto yeah so you know it's one of the

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,899
places you go to if you visit Japan

00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,670
alright so if you've been to Kyoto you

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:12,730
might notice that the are the some of

00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,290
the temples and shrines that you visit

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,349
or a lot of times like under

00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,290
constructions right and interesting

00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:20,030
thing is that

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,950
Japan as a country maybe he's like I

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,599
don't really know like thousand years

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,879
old or you know something like that

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,159
so these like temples and shrines are

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,450
like hundreds of years old like you know

00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,219
let's say like five hundred years over

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,530
six hundred years old and it's always

00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:35,859
raining there and these things are

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,299
pretty much made completely out of wood

00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:42,549
because if you use nail it's gonna rust

00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:45,379
right but also rot right so how do you

00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:47,209
like basically make a building that's

00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:48,950
made out of completely out of wood and

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,639
then keep it going for hundreds of years

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:56,090
um one of the thing they do is that they

00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:58,629
take this whole thing down like every

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:01,730
like 40 years or something like that

00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:05,239
such that all the way down to each parts

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:08,419
um so the people who's maintaining these

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,540
things also do not forget how to

00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:13,579
maintain these temples and shrines and

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,470
that's you know in English these are

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:18,230
called overalls right so one of the

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,139
things you do in the overhaul process is

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,019
that you basically take it apart and

00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:26,810
then if something looks bad

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:30,440
you remove it and then you update it

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,419
with the new parts and one of the things

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,470
like I said we learn out of these things

00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:38,389
is how to remove the AH you know

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,819
maintain these things and then rebuild

00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:43,159
these things back and the reason why

00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,590
this kind of like you know resonates

00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,780
with me is I'm not the original author

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,940
of SPT and neither is Dale basically

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,030
right so we're kinda like a current like

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:57,169
a third generation of the maintainer of

00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:00,129
this law bill to allah SBT and SP t1

00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,810
essentially is the overall version of

00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:08,989
the the whole series that's been going

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:11,060
on so the goal of SP t1 unlike many of

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,609
these like big version one number thing

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,699
is to pretty much avoid this version 2

00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:21,829
syndrome and minimize a conceptual jump

00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:23,780
from 0 13 so any of these experimental

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:25,849
thing we wanted to do we've been calling

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,070
it the you know technology preview

00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,729
that's been going on for several years

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,740
now right so all these features

00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,389
we really wanted to do experiment and

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,330
things like that that's been going on

00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:40,629
slowing slowing into the 0:13 series so

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,849
the from the 0:13 let's say 17 to spq on

00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:45,879
the jump is pretty much conceptually

00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:47,860
small so here are some of the updated

00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,479
parts I just want to like get it out

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,639
there all right

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,339
is semantic versioning this is kind of

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,259
like interesting right so we threw out

00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:59,020
these like history we've kind of learned

00:04:56,259 --> 00:05:01,120
that compatibility is huge right and

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,219
we're actually able to now like

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,589
responsibly maintain binary

00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,659
compatibility s and still kind of are

00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:10,719
the features so one of the things we're

00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:13,180
doing with SVG one is it will be compact

00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:16,120
binary compatible through our wand

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,789
why does that right so in the patch

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,699
releases we will be fixing bugs and then

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,080
in the you know the major or minor or

00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:25,539
whatever the second segment thing is

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,039
called one that one is already out and

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,279
then we're working on 1.2 right now

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:35,379
these would also be compatible with the

00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:38,050
1.0 another thing you want to talk about

00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:39,580
this port we yeah so another thing that

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,749
we also changed

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:46,749
Oh so again to sort of simplify SPT is

00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:50,979
we used to host parts of SBT on Ivy and

00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:54,039
this was a bit of an idea that the Ivy

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:57,639
layout that was used on that's available

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:01,629
on bin tray is more expressive and than

00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,689
than maven but we ended up not needing

00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,939
the expressivity that Ivy allows for us

00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:09,339
so we've transitioned to maven central

00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:13,469
which is what you know the the JVM

00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:17,770
ecosystem uses and it's helpful for

00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:19,599
other companies to consume SBT so this

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:24,729
is a simplification that we were able to

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:26,800
do in an SP t1 and the the you know

00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:28,930
other more apparent like stuff that you

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,839
see more often is that as opposed to

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,419
using Scala 210 which then like Yoel

00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,439
then deprecated and all that now that we

00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,539
can actually break the binary

00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,550
compatibility we're using the obvious

00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:43,180
less stable score 212 for the build

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,520
definition on so there is this this is

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,470
kind of like the

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,530
jump that we've done and this is

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,169
partially to support this a easier

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,690
evolution over time is instead of using

00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,940
the case class which is kind of

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,470
difficult to maintain the it's actually

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,900
impossible to maintain the binary

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,970
compatible like evolution because of the

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,650
copy method basically all you know

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,259
exposes all the peels

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,389
we're actually Co generating the pseudo

00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,759
case class are using the tool that we

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,889
wrote con contraband so that's one of

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,660
the surface area that you see sometimes

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:18,720
you have to change a lot of it in your

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,569
build so just to explain a lot of these

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,979
changes have to do with learnings that

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:27,900
we had in the 0:13 series of SBT so of

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,340
course everyone might know that in the

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,800
sky lake ecosystem we have binary

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,229
compatibility and between major versions

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,849
of Scala and that's something that we

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,150
deal with with libraries and

00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:41,520
applications and of course having SBT be

00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,370
implemented in Scala we suffer that as

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,319
well but now we're now working at the

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,810
application and library level working in

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,270
the tooling space and generally speaking

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,780
I would say people are even less patient

00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:58,590
with changes sort of artists artificial

00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:01,259
changes impacting the day to day work so

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,990
we're very hesitant to make unnecessary

00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,860
changes and throughout the series of SBT

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,590
0:13 we were very conservative with not

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,240
impacting the people's builds and

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,360
people's plugins the ecosystem of plugin

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,810
is very important and in this case s

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,930
scarlett case classes were very

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,580
problematic because we were using case

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,289
classes just like the whole sky lake

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,270
ecosystem does and there's the copy and

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:31,669
yun apply that really doesn't really

00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:35,099
work for for binary compatibility so

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:40,589
contraband was is our way of solving

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:43,500
this for SBT the other part that's kind

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:46,050
of like a interesting thing is that the

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,209
essentially like everyone needed the

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,450
incremental compilation all right even

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:54,000
if you're not using SBT and it's been

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,970
part of the SVT's codebase it's almost

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,060
like a crown jewel but like we basically

00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,290
made a decision

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,300
for they're kinda like a health of the

00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,010
community it's actually better to split

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,320
this thing out into the separate

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,410
repository so you know if you want to

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,150
build your own bill tool or in which you

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,250
know different organizations are working

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,920
on these things or you can let's reuse

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,130
this incremental compiler into one thing

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,990
so we've spilled out zinc one uh it's

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,150
actually using this cooler technology

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,950
called cost base name hashing which

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,110
works better for larger code base and

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,090
this repository is actually open source

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:32,320
and it's co maintained by both white

00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:35,950
band and scholars in turn on the other

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,380
related things we've done is that the in

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,810
order to kind of like walk towards the

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,450
absentee note getting rid of the ID and

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,700
going towards this like yeah you know

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,860
the Valhalla or ever of the course here

00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,570
and all that stuff we wanted to take

00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:53,950
this conservative step of first

00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:57,280
abstracting our IV into abstract API so

00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,860
the SPT one is still using our ID but

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,780
there is no direct dependency towards it

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,510
so there is one abstraction layer and

00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:07,060
then later down the road map we can then

00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:11,590
hopefully swap it out without like

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:15,070
impacting the actual bill the remove

00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:17,620
parts so the SPT dot plugin that's now

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:19,570
removed because we basically migrated

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:23,080
into using the auto plugin that was the

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,060
zero 1305 and since then majority of the

00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,590
ecosystem has been using auto plugin no

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:33,100
problem so and the other parts is this

00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:35,020
0:12 style also known as these like key

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,760
dependency operators or deficient

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,220
fishbone operators that's been really

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,120
confusing to people this is basically

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:45,220
gone and Topo enrichments we don't

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,870
really encourage that either so some of

00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,970
these things that you know some people

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,210
may using or if you've been using SBT

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,190
for a very long time sort of to reduce

00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:59,110
the surface area of the SBT we've

00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:02,040
removed these parts the new parts we'll

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,680
talk about more later or SPT server

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,660
unify slash syntax and well you know

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,670
more of these will be coming gradually

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,770
in the future the feature releases as

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,520
well so let's

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:18,070
the ecosystem of SPG it's like something

00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,200
that we talk a lot about you know like

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:25,210
between us and with other people as well

00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,490
so SPT for me um is not just a bill tool

00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:31,240
but it's actually like a hub of many

00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:34,420
things so it's a hub of many of your own

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,150
bills right and it's a hub of dependency

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,550
graph that many of the scholar libraries

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,560
are using it also provides this thing

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,050
called test interface so when you type

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,700
test you know like I'm not sure if you

00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,160
ever wondered why tests always works

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,650
even if the test is actually like done

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,590
by like specs to scholar check you know

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:55,750
or you know scholar the other brand new

00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,180
ones like mini test and the micro test

00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:01,090
because we have this interface actually

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,920
defined using Java so that the each

00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,810
different the test frameworks can

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,460
actually conform to certain standards

00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,670
that we can pick up the different

00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:13,600
examples of the test um it's also about

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,760
you know development tasks so SPT is a

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,430
lot of like a unique build tool and that

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,320
it gives you an interactive shell so you

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,150
can use it more than just doing a build

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,490
right it's a you can use like you can

00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,320
use that to centralize your like certain

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,600
business pipeline process or data

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,720
processing or deployment steps and stuff

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,450
like that so you know and that basically

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,720
is kind of represented with our plug-in

00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:40,540
ecosystem and also SPT is also the hub

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,550
of many of the developers you know like

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,860
contributing to the SPT itself and

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,710
people who's using that so it's

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,240
basically like a huge ecosystem that we

00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,270
want to kind of like you know nourish

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,960
and keep it going and you know like just

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,490
where we need to so how exactly big is

00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,860
this thing right we're trying to put the

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,900
numbers here so if you go to github and

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,430
pipe scholar version goes typically

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,870
that's like a setting everyone set to

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,380
the scholar version right with the

00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:11,800
extension of SBT I found roughly like

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,030
you know 150,000 code results and I'm

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,680
sure there are some duplicates and

00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,600
things like that that's like pretty good

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,990
like estimate or like this is the open

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:22,990
source size and in terms of the download

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,510
per month or notice that we switched to

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,240
maven central after SPG one so this does

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:30,310
really include the 0:13 so per month

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,370
wise were looking at something like you

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,230
know two hundred thousand but you know

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,200
again like download numbers or like you

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,700
know like the like what be hey you can't

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,100
really rely on that so it's more like a

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,410
trend generating thing but it's kind of

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,300
like going upwards but in the ballpark

00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,450
of again two hundred thousand something

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,300
like that um so one of the another

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,060
interesting metrics you can use is like

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,860
in like seven days or in certain period

00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,140
of time how many fresh install or

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,820
downloads you get because the if you're

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,970
just looking at the download obviously

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,410
if you have like Jenkins or in Travis

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,690
they could be downloading many many

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,940
times but you know typically don't grab

00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,920
my installers many many times so that

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,480
number is more like along the lines of

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,380
like you know tens of thousands

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,440
basically the other stuff that we care a

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:23,020
lot about are plugins so Scala Center

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,270
has this thing called Scala decks so if

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,210
you look into I think there's a category

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:32,280
or like a filter sssp key we have like

00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:37,060
450 v of 55 plugins and interestingly

00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:40,720
out of which like 300 ish is there 13

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,610
and 200 is already SVT one right so

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,760
we'll get to a little bit more later on

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,100
this migration process and also if I

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,440
look at the the community you know the

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,500
hosts that we do on under Ben Tre there

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,700
is like over 600 packages I'm sure some

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,770
of them are kind of like you know not

00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,960
really in use well you're not really in

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,070
the orders of these numbers for the

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,740
plugins so you know how do we migrate

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:07,720
this whole ecosystem right so one of the

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,520
things we've done is try to kind of like

00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,070
kind of crowdsource this thing like we

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,900
can't do this ourselves right so I one

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:16,990
of the thing I did is that I wrote like

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,000
some sort of script that grabs the

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,130
github stars and then kind of order

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,140
things by importance but it's like your

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,210
github store is probably good metrics

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,340
into looking at how popular your plugins

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:30,820
are and then just posted this thing into

00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,800
the wiki and like 10 days later after we

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,170
tweeted this thing like people were

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,490
jumping onto it and basically like

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,960
porting things

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,660
so basically visualizing the status

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,670
the progress alone can can I encouraged

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,920
a lot of the you know the plug-in

00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,810
authors in the community to jump in and

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,470
health laws and there's been yeah so

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,000
this basically after maybe like a month

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,920
or two months or something

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,200
the basically achieved whatever we

00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,970
wanted to achieve like within like one

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,860
month period we got like hundred top

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,130
hundred plugins were like converted and

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,440
released and merge and stuff like that

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,200
um so do you want to talk about the

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,040
other places so this so I wanted to also

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:17,360
use this talk to kind of explain in a

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,920
way that SPT is a scholar project and

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,260
it's it's it's very similar to other

00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,790
open-source projects and it might very

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,430
similar to your own

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,620
scholar projects that you do at home or

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:33,680
at work etc and so as many other

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:37,220
open-source projects we use github for

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,610
for our code sharing and github issues

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,500
the stack overflow we have a forum where

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,080
we can discuss tooling things and SPT is

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,410
obviously a big part of that get ur

00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:50,810
rooms one for users and one for

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,390
contributors just to try and keep the

00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,060
talks a bit specialized one thing that

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,070
we do in particular that's maybe a

00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,580
little bit different and other projects

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,550
is we have a meeting every week where we

00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:08,330
talk about the development of SPT and

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:09,950
zinc which we do every Wednesday and in

00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,560
a way it's open for people that are

00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:15,320
interested to collaborate with with us

00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,930
on SPT and want to contribute and they

00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,940
can jump in and share their thoughts and

00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,940
share their questions and and we can

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,480
spend some time face-to-face and talk

00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,670
about what we've been up to and what

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,760
they could perhaps be looking at well

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,940
face to face and hang out in how it

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,930
helps it works very well for Eugenia

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,910
anyone can join them because it's

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,890
hangout meeting is off dude literally

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:41,810
show up okay Eugene and I use it to

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,810
collaborate because we don't we don't

00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,430
work in the same office so yeah so

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,660
that's something that's a bit special

00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:52,760
about SPT and zinc but yeah I just

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,150
wanted to sort of list the different

00:17:52,760 --> 00:18:02,000
things that the different ways in which

00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:05,450
SPT works as a project and another thing

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,160
about SPT is as we sort of said earlier

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,310
about the different components of SPT

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:13,190
these are the different sections of SPT

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,740
just to sort of outline the build tool

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:18,350
and zinc as Eugene talked about the

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,650
library management abstraction a couple

00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:25,450
of lower repositories website launcher

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:31,820
oh these are components of SVT just to

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:33,830
to share and we split them out and so

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,860
that it's easier to get involved in

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:41,300
these smaller pieces of okay of SVT and

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,830
but in a way as I said earlier they're

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,240
there they're all very similar to

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,290
approach your own project they all use

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:51,890
SPT itself to build we use Travis CI and

00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,570
and testing tools to to test them so

00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,950
this is something I also found recently

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,400
with the scarless freeze that we've been

00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,840
doing

00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,960
Eugene and I had been getting organized

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,960
and participating and people that were

00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,630
interested in SPT to try and help out

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,730
and contribute they they were sometimes

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,830
surprised that it's actually not that

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,380
difficult to contribute to to SPT it's

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,870
it's it's just another scholar project

00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,440
with as an SPT build and unit tests and

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,270
so forth

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,370
so I just wanted to highlight that here

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,020
so the there's a lot of type of

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,420
contributions so I just want to

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,950
emphasize it's not just about like

00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,740
sending poor quests I mean they'll be

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,990
greatly appreciated but you know like I

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,370
said like I think of SPT more like a hub

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,070
of a bunch of different things right

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,500
graphs and people and knowledge right so

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:42,320
you can help the adoption not work like

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,570
you know someone stuck at Build and you

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,220
help someone that work online or stock

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,710
overflow that's actually one of the

00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,920
biggest contribution you can make you

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,840
know like at your own work or online you

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,540
can kind of hang out or get a child like

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,150
open up some stock overflow and assist

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,040
your users or kind of like convince your

00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,620
colleague maybe you know we should try a

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,900
speaky for some project

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,540
you know expanding its usage so if you

00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,480
have like a weird like a batch file that

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,830
you're running or you know the some

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,750
shell script that you're running to do

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,000
some process maybe you can centralize

00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,000
that to use SPG right like a company

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,670
plug-in system or something like that

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,730
other parts is like documentation so

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:27,560
they added this edit button on the svt's

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,810
documentation so you hit the edit button

00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,720
it will literally open like edit screen

00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:35,840
and github so if you wanna just like fix

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,180
a typo in our dogs it's pretty simple

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,780
and if you speak like second languages

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,670
so you know like translated to your like

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,890
your Japanese or German or Spanish

00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,840
friends you know so a lot could be a

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,250
great way of actually contributing like

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,730
getting started guard or something like

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,980
that um other thing is as the you know

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,960
project gets bigger and bigger you know

00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,060
the issue tracker also gets bigger and

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,160
bigger and bigger right so just going

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:04,400
through them and then like see if it's

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,980
you know relevant still in SVT one age

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,840
and just kind of like get our attentions

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,580
maybe this is ready to be closed out or

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,770
you know we can't reproduce this anymore

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,780
oh these come like we call this

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,820
gardening basically right gardening

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,490
these issue tracker that's a huge

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,920
contribution as well so in as well of

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,810
course reporting issues are expanding

00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,390
ecosystem in different ways like writing

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,700
plugins so these are all different ways

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,650
that you know we appreciate the

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,900
contributions and then we're actively

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,330
seeking our swipe them to you know get

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,970
more contributions from the community to

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,710
get this going

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:43,010
so yeah I guess I already kind of talked

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,170
a lot about the the gardening part um so

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,360
one of the things is that you know if

00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,610
the interesting discussions are going on

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,400
and other forms are kind of like writing

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,590
a summary in there or like shifting like

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,660
facts and opinions and things like that

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:01,250
these are kind of like those things you

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:03,350
could basically do batching wars so we

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,140
have this thing called all I've been

00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,820
discuss are like you know different

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,000
people have the other discourse

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,280
instances so basically this is a light

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,440
been discuss is used by our light

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,850
parents like I think our katene

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,639
and you know all these different teams

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,679
to get their questions and answers and

00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,240
proposals and things like that the way

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,659
to link team uses it right now is

00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,070
basically we're using as forum mostly

00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,019
for contributions so if you have

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,830
questions and you know like he asked

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,409
there kind of stuff

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,809
please use Stack Overflow because we've

00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:38,029
been doing that for a while the discuss

00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:40,700
we use is for like a proposals of the

00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:42,019
new features and the plug-in authors and

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,450
different ecosystem to kind of

00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:46,389
communicate different ideas I will show

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,789
like some examples of that later and

00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:52,480
another thing is that we have this tag I

00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:55,909
think they Oh is super passionate about

00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:01,009
we want to talk about yes so we've been

00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:02,809
following a proposal I guess github kind

00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:06,049
of centralized on Help Wanted in good

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,370
first issue to try and help bring

00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:10,850
structure across different repositories

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:15,220
on github and we really like it because

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:17,899
we care very much about making SBT

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,490
accessible to new contributors people

00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:23,899
who haven't contributed to open-source

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,399
as much and so we've been using the good

00:23:23,899 --> 00:23:27,110
first issue and also making sure that

00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:29,090
the quality of good first issues is high

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,509
and we've had a lot of success in a

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,370
scholar spree of adding a lot of what I

00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,919
call mentoring instructions on good

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,649
first issues so that with the label

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,899
people can drill down we have about six

00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:43,639
seven hundred issues but we only try and

00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:46,009
make sure we have ten good first issues

00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:50,559
and it works great for hackathons or

00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:53,960
scholars briefs and people find that

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,309
they can work for about an hour on a

00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,159
project that they've never worked on

00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,570
before and make a contribution and from

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,669
there eventually they can start getting

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,100
to the slightly harder the more the less

00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:06,799
easy the less good first issues and

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,330
maybe something that's helps them more

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,720
at work in their own project in their

00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,370
own library and having gotten started

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,750
with it with one issue they can they can

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:20,570
move on to other ones so the other con

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:23,210
alike interesting aspect of SBT is we do

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,250
some like a more philosophical or

00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:27,379
experimental work using the plug-in

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,270
ecosystem because SPG itself is pretty

00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:31,610
you know like flexible

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,280
so there are some of the examples that

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:37,430
kind of like got merged back into SPT

00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,980
basically so SPT core next was done

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:42,560
during the thirteen series to experiment

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,870
the server meta communication mechanism

00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,780
so that without Morrison to speak you on

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:50,240
the dog a was my kind of like the

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,640
experiment around invert inverting the

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,400
loop of the cross building so it

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,830
actually aggregates around Scala version

00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,810
first and then the sub-project axis so

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,630
that got basically accepted as a

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:05,480
proposal and got into svq on slash is a

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,670
similar story across building is all

00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,520
your harnesses are really really awesome

00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,930
this is like a plugin out there is

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,630
plugin which allows you to cross build

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,310
the plugins across multiple scale

00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:18,950
version I mean the SVG versions and

00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:23,020
again I got accepted into the SBT one

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:26,300
core so this is to me I think is

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:29,990
something that's very powerful in SBT we

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,990
our configuration is code and so you can

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,150
work in a build and you can develop some

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,290
part of functionality or some behavior

00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,390
of your build

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,400
we've been within your own build within

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,020
your own repository and eventually you

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,220
could start seeing maybe you have a

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,440
couple of different bills a couple

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,820
different projects and in separate repos

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,010
and you start seeing that this

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,700
functionality translates you know you

00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:54,560
want to reuse it so you might start

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,180
deep-fryer disconnecting the builds and

00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,820
this plugin make it a bit more generic

00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,010
and then eventually it can be you can

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,720
pull it out into a separate plugin if

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,830
this is very useful within companies if

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,960
you have anything which is company

00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,480
specific I highly recommend creating an

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,830
SVG plugin for your own company you can

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,970
do it open source you can keep it closed

00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,720
source whatever you feel more

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,820
comfortable with and so these these are

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,140
exactly these they're there are parts of

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,610
the behavior of SBT which wasn't did it

00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:26,030
always work it wasn't always the best

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:28,580
decision and so Eugene and and others

00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,320
before Eugene have created plugins to

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,450
experiment with changing this behavior

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,830
and and some of them became so good that

00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,990
they were better than what came out of

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,790
the box and SBT or they were missing an

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,220
SVG they didn't spt proper they didn't

00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,440
exist so we fold them back into the core

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,330
and so this Inc

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,590
mental step I think works really well

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:51,649
for SBT so the one of the major feature

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,240
I'm not like to save the time I think I

00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:56,090
have to start to speed up around this

00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,679
the server stuff so I'm not sure if you

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,269
guys notice this picture since we're in

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,350
New York this is actually uh

00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:05,450
the Mario Cuomo bridge basically so I

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,070
wrote this blog post called the SPT

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,929
server reboot and I really thought about

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,960
like this is like my favorite bridge

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:14,090
basically is the UH is the Tappan Zee

00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,919
Bridge and the more thing all right

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,590
so you have this whole thing going on

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,440
this is like 0:13 ecosystem and how do

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,710
we like reboot the SVT server as a

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,559
project and one of the philosophy I kind

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,110
of took is that you know instead of the

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,850
over-engineering and karma because the

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,590
basically activator and the remote

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,750
control was another project basically

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,940
was trying to do a sweetie server but

00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,340
it's like a lot of like needs and wants

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,659
and features so I said you know instead

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,250
maybe we should not cut down all these

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,929
features and instead of the

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,850
over-engineering like intentionally

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,860
under engineer it basically you would

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,990
start shipping things not really

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,269
completely ready but like semi kind of

00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,240
usable and kind of experiment with these

00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:59,769
ideas so so that's basically the idea

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,149
behind SPG server and you know the

00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:04,639
berkeley this car like concept started

00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:06,620
to mature into this like this is not

00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:08,210
like my doing this is Microsoft and all

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,149
these industries are gradually going

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:13,309
towards this direction so LSP there's a

00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:15,169
language server protocol created by

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,389
Microsoft for the BS code and then

00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:21,259
there's other vendors involved basically

00:28:17,389 --> 00:28:24,080
treats the IDE almost like a web server

00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:26,389
so instead of you know different vendors

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,059
making like hard coded version of the UI

00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:30,470
and compilation work like the

00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:33,049
traditional like Eclipse and visual

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,450
studio the LSB basically is a concept

00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:37,159
where the front-end is provided by BS

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,809
code they collect some wine them and all

00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,580
that stuff in the backend of the

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:42,470
language basically acts like a web

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,769
server and it's like you hit that stuff

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:49,039
using a JSON API and SPG server

00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:51,710
basically acts as you know the LSP

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,809
server off or kind of like not exactly

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,270
because we are still working towards

00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:57,190
this off Scala's LSP

00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,080
but the the similar fashion in which

00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:01,240
like you have this one single source of

00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,590
truth and different clients hooking into

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,280
it and that's like a very similar

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:08,710
concept of the SBT server that we had so

00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,510
why is this calll important is that like

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,310
I said we have all these graphs and

00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,500
knowledge and testing great integrations

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,270
and like you know awesome plugins but

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,400
there is still huge demand for the rich

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,830
development environment right I like

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,630
jumping two errors KO navigations and

00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:25,240
top completions and things like that and

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:27,100
LSP and like event logging basically

00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,530
sits right in the middle of these things

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,020
that can gradually kind of like achieve

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:34,420
these things so I see this space today

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,220
as this global trend basically ah

00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,980
so these are some histories of this

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,710
thing against you know swaps which skip

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,440
these parts so SPT server basically is a

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,510
single JVM process and like I said it

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,920
essentially acts it doesn't really do

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:49,630
like what you may think the server

00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,670
sounds like all right like sound like a

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,530
magical thing that runs a bunch of

00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,540
servers and compiled everything it's not

00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,720
exactly that it's more like think of it

00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,570
as like a network api to an into SBT so

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,120
like the actual client kwang-ho is more

00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:06,490
like IDs and stuff like that so one of

00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:13,320
the demos basically I have is uh you

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:18,730
know you go to terminal and type code

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:23,740
dot this opens our vehicle

00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:26,980
I think right and inside the vs code I

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:30,130
have this like a kind of a demo like vs

00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,800
code extension called the odd SPT and in

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,210
there basically opens up SPT I'm not

00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,490
sure if you can see from the back

00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:39,210
hopefully it does this is new client

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:42,610
connected right so now SP key and

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:45,540
obvious code is talking to each other so

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:50,200
I can basically do normal like names

00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:52,930
right so what this means is that I type

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:56,560
some code that doesn't like compile and

00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:59,010
then this basically is going to start

00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,010
talking

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:10,590
yeah so you see this you're now the the

00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:18,380
earth doesn't so let me try again

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:22,110
who goes away alright so if I see this

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:24,630
so this now shows the problems there are

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,710
compilation errors right here and then I

00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:31,980
can jump to these places so it's kind of

00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,230
like a basic ah the demo of how like a

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,880
bill tool and the front-end editor can

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,350
basically talk to each other so you

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,660
still have these like single source of

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,910
truth like your favorite plugins the

00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,559
graphs and all that stuff but you can

00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,080
kind of like merge it with a more richer

00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:47,790
stuff and then you know navigate and all

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:56,549
that stuff which is you know everyone's

00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:58,290
kind of working towards right so but you

00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,870
know eventually this can also lead to

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,280
like servers talking to each other and

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,419
distributive build and all that the

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,000
different stuff in the future

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,520
potentially about the initial goal

00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,640
basically is to like I said enhance the

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:17,790
development experience skip these parts

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,559
yeah so we use the others the UNIX

00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,440
sockets so you can actually talk to it

00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,630
like this so this NC it's the commanding

00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,950
you can hook into the UNIX socket for

00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:31,740
local stuff and event logging basically

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:34,830
base is the instead of using the log

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,809
just using a text right the concept is

00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:39,210
basically you are able to pass an object

00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:41,610
as a message and then that gets sent and

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,980
as a JSON object on the other end so you

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,010
can like so if you think about like the

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:49,470
return type of compile that's what this

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,940
is basically about like the actual like

00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,500
the return type is actually called the

00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,150
analysis you don't really care about

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,470
that stuff right that's why sweetie is

00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,150
using internally to do incremental

00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,490
compilation what you actually care about

00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:01,860
is what's shown on the screen so that's

00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,470
a map right and the side effects which

00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,059
is the class file because SPT is kind of

00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,010
interesting because we kind of pretend

00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:10,290
there's no side effects right but the

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,750
what you want is these events that gets

00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,490
populated into the client side so that's

00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,410
what this is about

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:20,460
so the slash syntax

00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:22,950
so one of the words of SBT that I always

00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,700
have this pet peeve is a to describe the

00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:29,640
same concept right like sub project

00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,550
configuration and name inside the build

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,140
our SPG and in this interactive show we

00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:36,360
use have this completely different

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,220
syntax of like Collins and double

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,840
Collins and like triple Collins and all

00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,460
that stuff right this is kind of crazy

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,620
to me that you have like two different

00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,480
notation I know there is good reasons

00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,990
originally it was implemented that ways

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,120
for tab completion but I thought it's

00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:53,340
like it's like to to learning curve is

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,040
too steep or to not steep or something

00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,850
like that right so when you if I slash

00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,680
syntax basically is like my like

00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:06,240
improvement into the SVT one which

00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,950
unifies this thing right so it's unifier

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,710
is the way you describe your build and

00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:13,530
where you interact with the show and

00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,620
same st. saying stop so here's example

00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,300
right sky option and test comma console

00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,429
I'm sure some of you are familiar if

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,260
you've ever used SVT and it was called

00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:25,409
like test call on console Colin Colin

00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,840
it's like options so an SVT one long

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:30,780
words which is available right now one

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:33,780
one six uh they're saying you just use

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,750
slash everywhere that's it right it's

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,620
kind of cool because this actually kind

00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:42,419
of in maps with this hierarchy sort of

00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,210
that's implicit in this thing right we

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:47,100
have reference its reference we want to

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:50,100
explain what the reference is yeah it's

00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,510
me that was this build and sub project

00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:56,070
basically all right let's call reference

00:34:51,510 --> 00:35:01,650
then yeah so there was scoping was

00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:03,930
introduced within SBT in order to define

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:08,430
a key and have it have it have a meaning

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:11,220
like compile or test which is basically

00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:13,230
execute tests but then be able to

00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,600
specialize them a bit like how maven did

00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:17,550
there's a lot of looking at how maven

00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:21,030
did things and instead of recreating it

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,400
in an SPT and trying to improve it and

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:27,300
so scoping for example of compile and

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,990
test scope was was what was what what

00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,430
was done and and then then

00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,500
multi-project support was added to SBT

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,760
and then multi build support so that's

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,760
why it's called reference rather than

00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:43,210
project but as Eugene said earlier there

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,570
they were competing needs between the

00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,040
way in which your builds was configured

00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,360
in Scala code and the way that you

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,210
interacted with the interactive shell

00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,210
that we have an SVT in particular and

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:56,800
yes in the in the interactive shell you

00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,960
want a tab completion is actually a

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,580
really big thing and SBT which so not as

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,260
well-known hit tab because there's a lot

00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,170
of stuff that it that tab does and it

00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,480
will make it easier to interactive SBT

00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,430
if you use the tab feature but on the

00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,230
other hand in encode we have

00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:13,360
restrictions of the language there are

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:17,380
there are things to do with operators

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,960
there are precedents and syntax aspects

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,890
that we need to deal with so

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,480
unfortunately there was this disconnect

00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,940
and there was yeah I was going to do

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,800
this manual translation in your head at

00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,510
some point in my learning or SBT I

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,830
understood the translation between the

00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:34,570
two but I mean it's unnecessary so

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:36,580
Eugene experimented again as I said

00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:40,090
earlier in a separate plug-in experiment

00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:42,370
to this idea of can can we find a happy

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,650
medium where we have tab completion and

00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:47,220
and we can sort of follow the rules of

00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,110
Scala syntax and so we came up with this

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:54,850
third syntax we called unified slash

00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:57,640
syntax and the idea is that it's you can

00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,530
translate the interactive aspect and you

00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,480
can translate the Scala code into this

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,130
unified syntax and now we don't no

00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,500
longer have to do this translation and

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,840
and the nice thing about that is now

00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,630
when we talking about error messages in

00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,910
the interactive shell the the the result

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:14,830
of the error messages is just as usable

00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:17,050
in the shell and in code because again

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:20,190
it's it's unified and only the one

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:22,690
syntax so there's actually more

00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:25,390
experiments that I'm cooking up and so

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:28,540
maybe you can get to that right so what

00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:30,280
Mark areas within SPG yes you know we

00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,530
are aware of the blog post of the

00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:37,030
problems of the SVG and things like that

00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:40,829
so here are some like my like a answer

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:43,140
rap song the of the Harris it's on the

00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:46,200
I agree like you know a lot of the

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:49,319
problems with NS PT so there is a sauce

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,869
dependency right the so when you have

00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:53,190
multiple repositories but like you know

00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,499
you want to change one thing you want to

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,700
compile this whole thing together so I

00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:59,279
wrote this plugin

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,499
I think after like Scala days Berlin so

00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:06,869
this wasn't in Berlin like you heard it

00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:09,839
first here s PT sriracha is as this you

00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:13,410
know cool DSL on into your project or

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,700
dot source dependency which allows you

00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:19,200
to actually point that both graph

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,759
basically it was like a some sort of

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,039
like a source code under this workspace

00:38:20,759 --> 00:38:26,489
directory which is currently kind of

00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:29,130
like configured to be like user you know

00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:31,170
your name slash like workspace oh you

00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,940
can change that with setting and then

00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,069
you can check out all into hard coded

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,660
into that place so you always check out

00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:39,150
your stuff into this you know source

00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,789
under a sort workspace and then you can

00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,249
also specify the real binary stuff the

00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:46,529
cool thing is that normally for users

00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:48,599
they will just use a binary but if you

00:38:46,529 --> 00:38:51,479
happen to want to simultaneously evolve

00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,420
right if you're doing Chronicle emulated

00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:57,390
mono repo situation you can then use the

00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,180
switch called - the SBT that source node

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:02,279
equals true into the SBT and it will

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,709
switch over into using the source as a

00:39:02,279 --> 00:39:06,839
dependency so you can basically multi

00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,569
all test out your you know multiple

00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:12,329
repository at the same time and I

00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:14,400
actually use that too like when the some

00:39:12,329 --> 00:39:16,140
test library is not available yet I just

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,849
like make some modification and check it

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,190
out into traffic and stuff like so

00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:25,410
there's a blog post I wrote hot sauce

00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:28,579
dependencies using SBT sriracha on the

00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:31,979
other part is our cost building across

00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,150
different Scala versions and platforms

00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:34,949
and all that stuff right it's almost

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,039
like this like multi-dimensional

00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:41,219
hypercube of this thing where it gets

00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:43,559
really complicated so this is one thing

00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,599
I'm currently working on actively it

00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,759
likely will be a plugin that will be

00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,029
available in the future called SBT

00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:54,210
project matrix so kind of taking in the

00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:56,999
hints from the SPG cross and

00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,890
the the Scala giasses syntax of the

00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:01,440
cross sociology is is able to do

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:04,109
multi-platform the SBT cross is able to

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,970
do multiple scholar versions a lot kind

00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:08,279
of like have a generic solution that's

00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,799
kind of built into SBT that's able to

00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:12,809
connect so user or the plugin can extend

00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:16,559
you have this like a multi-dimensional

00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:19,170
thing into just using a sub-project so

00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:21,150
there is a slang I will share this slide

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,680
later are called their spatial

00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,259
representation of the cross building

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,380
it's a whole mouthful but essentially as

00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:31,140
this thing called project matrix that's

00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,180
able to express multiple platforms or

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,400
your own custom axes basically if you

00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:39,210
want to do like you know like this patch

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,769
version a B and C against your stuff or

00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:44,039
something like that or maybe like for

00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:45,930
spark or something and you know if you

00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:48,480
typically the one that I see more often

00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:51,240
is like you know Jas and JVM and native

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,400
and different versions of Scala right so

00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,319
using this project matrix you can have

00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,950
like two matrices that can depend on

00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,400
each other so only if you have to 12 or

00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,930
then it will depend on the core so it'll

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,999
basically create like currently it's

00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,799
really difficult to do so in SPT because

00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:10,650
we kind of mutate using plus plus

00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:13,140
operator this will basically get rid of

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,269
that you just try to compile there is

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,369
some like potential you know drawback

00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:19,289
because it's gonna increase the memory

00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:22,589
of course right there's like a memory

00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:24,569
and time trade-offs but the this

00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:26,700
basically gives you option to be able to

00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:32,249
do the cross building a lot more

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:33,930
elegantly I think any questions I'm not

00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:37,400
sure if you have too much time maybe you

00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,400
can take one question

00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:41,519
[Music]

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,510
so I was wondering if there are any

00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,970
plans to enable to integrate with

00:41:52,510 --> 00:42:00,060
nail-gun so we can skip the interactive

00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:02,980
shell similar to what bloop does yes so

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:05,500
I'm not gonna really promise that it's

00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,510
gonna be done done but like that's

00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,570
exactly kind of like a similar use case

00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,060
we might kind of need in order to do a

00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,610
competitor LSP integration anyway so

00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,619
that the editors can kind of say I don't

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:19,000
really need your interactive shell but I

00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,470
just want to make sure a speedy service

00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,930
up and running and be able to do

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,210
compilation all right so we are there

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:27,640
are like think clients project they're

00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,590
like I might be working on they'll

00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,260
actually have some like a secret like I

00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:35,020
think client he's running as well so in

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,240
that note basically it will be able to

00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:40,420
kind of use it like bloop where like

00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,680
something like let's say SBT - client or

00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,380
something like that right and then you

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,720
can say - client compile it will like

00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,700
launch SBT in the background process and

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,170
be able to talk to it so like I've been

00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,359
thinking a lot about it and I actually

00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:54,369
started prototyping a little bit so it

00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,040
might happen but yes I'm not gonna make

00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:59,800
meal promises yeah

00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,730
any other questions all right so we'll

00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,580
be outside

00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:06,070
so if you have questions I also have SVT

00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,700
stickers if you guys want so thanks for

00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,750
coming

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:13,269
and

00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,269
