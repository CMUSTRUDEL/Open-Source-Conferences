Abstract:
What new superpowers does it give me?
 
The machine learning libraries in Apache Spark are an impressive piece of software engineering, and are maturing rapidly. What advantages does Spark.ml offer over the older technologies that inspired its design?
 
At Data Science Retreat we've taken a real-world dataset and worked through the stages of building a predictive model -- exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model fitting -- in several different frameworks. We'll show what it's like to work with Spark.ml, and compare it to other widely used frameworks (in R and python) along several dimensions: ease of use, productivity, feature set, and performance. 
 
In some ways Spark.ml is still rather immature, but it also conveys new superpowers to those who know how to use it. We hope to inspire you to join us in using and improving it.

right my name is Jose Quesada I'm the

00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:14,360
director of the science retreat and I'm

00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:17,480
here to talk about machine learning in

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,449
the spark / SCADA

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,160
world originally David was going to do

00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,880
this talk but he got sick so I'm

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,030
replacing him

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,420
I've changed the talk a little bit from

00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:32,239
my experience attending Scottish New

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:37,010
York and from conversations in the

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,650
corridor here in Berlin so my gut

00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,900
feeling after talking to some sort of

00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,899
people here is that there is not that

00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,610
much machine learning going on in this

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,649
particular audience

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,440
so can you raise your hand if you have

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:55,489
deployed a machine learning model okay

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,510
no there is some okay so we are doing

00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,780
better than New York

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:02,719
definitely so it was like 25 percent of

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,930
their own raise his hand and in New York

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,310
I will guest it will be 10 percent or

00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:13,969
less right okay so I'm going to start

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,060
very slowly with a definition of machine

00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:20,090
learning so there are plenty of

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,130
definitions it's not like one of that is

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,049
better than the others this one I

00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,270
particularly like so you're going to

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,369
build things then learn so you have to

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,459
encode what what the machine is going to

00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:33,889
do that she is going to learn that and

00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:35,319
that's why it has this name of machine

00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:40,909
learning right

00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:43,270
right so why why it is talk well I'm

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,969
going to go out of a limb here and say

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,759
that in five years time we are all going

00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:53,779
to be deploying machine learning models

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:58,700
so today in 2016 25% of the room raises

00:01:53,779 --> 00:02:02,029
his hand in five years time I'm betting

00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,479
that the dye room will have raised their

00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:08,869
hand

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:10,280
and this is a consequence of how how

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,880
easy it is to build products with what

00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,970
you're learning nowadays so if you were

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,660
around

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:22,930
back in the 70s I guess when relational

00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,820
databases became mainstream there was a

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,890
time there that nobody knew what was

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,790
going to happen but then after that

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,730
window ended as sequel was everywhere

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,120
and everybody knew what relational

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:41,200
databases were same thing for the web in

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,330
the 90s Oh HTTP and HTML so on for a

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,460
while it was new and shiny and then

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,940
everybody was doing it right so I

00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:51,310
suspect that we are in a the same point

00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,050
right now with machine learning so it's

00:02:51,310 --> 00:03:00,220
becoming mainstream in a good way and a

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:03,520
bad way you will see so they'll turn

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,890
ative to this to this not happening is

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,420
pretty bad because that means that

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,280
machine learning will stay at arc art

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,370
that only a few practitioners know and

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,410
they tell their students in a corner of

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:20,470
some university and that's not good for

00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:22,300
anybody right so this is how I came up

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,420
with this prediction of five years in

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,750
the 90s they visit a typical busy pitch

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,200
will be well this is like blah but on

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:36,190
the web and this will work in the notice

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,350
it was well this is like XPath social in

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:43,090
the teens this is like expert on mobile

00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,459
and this is 16 if you go to obviously

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:50,950
very likely you're going to hear this

00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:52,570
like Xbox especially early right so you

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,489
may have found this on Twitter floating

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,160
around that supports it in the world

00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:00,400
that many industries want to become

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,130
software industries which you will never

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,170
imagine so the last two days there was

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,870
an IOT conference in the same building

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,810
and you could see caramel factors there

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,299
like hardcore manufacturers of like

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,880
physical things say we want to become a

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:17,560
software company so that's the

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,570
software's it in the world part of it

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,630
but of course that's only the beginning

00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,940
so some people say that machine learning

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,729
is going to be on top of that it's going

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,160
to produce more value so then machine

00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,770
learning cities software

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,470
and the perfect example of the follow up

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,350
example is self-driving cars right so

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,240
this is why manufacturers people who are

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,770
making their living building physical

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,200
things want to become software companies

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:49,110
right and the really interesting thing

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:53,730
is that this is not happening in the US

00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:57,720
only so you know under UN so he's the

00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:00,090
founder of Coursera he was a Stanford

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,600
professor of a long time he's one of the

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:07,110
most prominent is machine learning heads

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,250
out there he went to Bible in China and

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,590
I guess this is a first that people at

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,590
of that caliber I'm moving away from the

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,330
US it used to be the other way right and

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:24,060
his building all kind of crazy stuff for

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:26,340
Baidu he said in this sparks amid talk

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,310
that he is building hundreds of projects

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,640
where the goal is not profit it's not

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,300
making money it's getting more data

00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,300
because any one of these companies have

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,980
a peak investment in machine learning

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,170
but there are only one year ahead of

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,970
their competitors and that's not the

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,130
festival that having data and nobody

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,840
else has it's very much of a rear of

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,030
entry and this is what they are trying

00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,380
to build so people who understand that

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,410
are surprisingly not only Google

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,310
Facebook and Amazon so there are plenty

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,340
of people all over the world

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,169
understanding this and surprisingly even

00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,720
car manufacturers seems to be starting

00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:09,510
to understand this so there is more

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,980
value in the data that you collect then

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,290
in the physical thing that you produce

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,260
for example this Fitbit thing that I'm

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,360
wearing sprawled in 50 euro but the data

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,330
that it collects it's very worth more

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:27,060
than 50 euro for more than one company

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:29,660
not only the makers of this right so let

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,660
me show you

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:38,530
an example of what's possible nowadays

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:42,759
nowadays with machine learning so this

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:46,590
is an example of image recognition in

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:50,199
video and it's getting to a point that

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,659
recognizing objects in images it's

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,860
becoming a solved problem so that was

00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:58,720
not possible in 2014 or even 2015 this

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,319
is actually a toy implementation of

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,979
neural net that recognizes object so you

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,840
can see up there

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,460
it's from very often but it still is

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,659
kind of amazing that you can tell you

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:17,889
what it sees so to simplify this

00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:19,360
computers can see now it's right and it

00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,460
will be wrong plenty of times

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,110
this actually interested in JavaScript I

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,310
think it's very tiny like problem and

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,440
this guy is walking around the street

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,300
with a laptop pointing the laptop at

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,440
things so this is running a laptop a

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:37,900
real production machine learning system

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,969
will be running on plenty of GPUs on

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,719
servers right it will be doing much

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:47,680
better than this but this is what the

00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:50,880
state of the art is right now and this

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,800
is images in text you can find a

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,190
challenge that just ended two weeks ago

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,380
where you can upload a picture and then

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,300
the challenge was to answer any

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,719
questions about things that were in the

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,630
picture like how many ships are in these

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:10,569
pictures and the machine can do two

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:14,289
decent job at answering any question

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,509
about anything in the picture so this is

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:20,349
not the type of things that we were used

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:21,610
to five years ago so if you tell me five

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:25,319
years ago that this was going to happen

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,319
I will tell you that

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:44,810
right right so the test is to treat this

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,850
is that company here in Berlin that

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,560
specializes in training people that want

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,030
to switch career and going to do the

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,010
science machine learning and so on

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:58,650
within doing this for three years and

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,840
the way we operate is to get best people

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,120
we can to teach every topic they teach

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,940
only today so so they go very deep into

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,780
one topic and we bring as many of those

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,780
as we can the people who attend the

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,090
retreat are also pretty designed when

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:18,870
they come we interview about 200 people

00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:22,910
per batch and accept 5% of them like 5

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,800
to 10 guys we try to get people who can

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,850
develop products so they can see a need

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,950
in the market and they can put together

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,670
a product and they do that in portfolio

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:35,100
projects and then they go in front of

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,130
companies and they get hired and go do

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,600
interesting things for companies why do

00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,330
people do this because there are plenty

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,560
of online materials out there too if you

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,950
want to learn machine learning right I

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,170
think there is something so this is the

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,970
the histogram of ability in the designs

00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,190
so there are plenty of people that can

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,050
fit a random forest that does not a

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,900
problem ABI has done a MOOC that taught

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:01,050
you how to fit a random forest but doing

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:03,360
the typical 10x totally spectacular

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,830
improvement that would make serious

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,140
money to a company that's not so easy

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,090
and there is nothing between and I think

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:14,670
people come to the asserted to jump from

00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:19,520
one side to the other yes my guess this

00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:23,460
is an example of a smile recognition

00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,990
system that a participant built so it

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,900
could look at many people in the room

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,540
but this is just one face this was 2014

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,810
so when dip nets start becoming popular

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,930
and the feedback that he got when he

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,430
presented this in demo day from the

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,800
companies who are trying to hire

00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:42,330
was like why did you want a job why

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,560
don't you just go and create a company

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,950
con with this right

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:51,300
so he went and did it and now he's doing

00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:54,029
a smile recognition with fake smiles so

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,790
this is now pretty known technology

00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:59,279
cameras do this the caching images that

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:03,440
there are smiling and sold by in 2014

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:07,620
that was kind of spectacular still right

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,570
so people who come are happy companies

00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,560
who hire them are happy so everything is

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:17,880
working so why am I talking about this

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,570
and why is DSR actually doing any of

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,350
this

00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,810
well light pen has a partnership with

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,350
IBM so ibn is behind this big data

00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:31,470
University and they reach to us to

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,060
produce online materials to train people

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,910
who want to dimension learning in a

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,250
scholar and at that point there was

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,870
nothing out there on the web for that

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,190
particular problem

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:47,250
and we built about 25 videos already we

00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,930
are going to build 75 total and we'll

00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,060
talk more about those videos but now

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,279
there is a pretty serious value of

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,589
material out there if you want to do the

00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,060
machine learning on scala

00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:04,050
with a spark the interesting thing is

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,850
that people who who do spark they do

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:10,650
plenty of Python surprisingly although

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:17,700
it's pretty hard to do things from from

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:19,860
Python so I'd have to convince you if

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,510
you are in this room that Scala is a

00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:26,940
very good language to do anything with

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:30,570
spark right but the wall out there is

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:32,640
different so since I have to interview

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,329
many people and go to conferences so I

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:41,100
meet all kind of personas that that want

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:43,529
to do this kind of thing so let's let's

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,180
go one by one so I made them really like

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,220
a stick figures because I wanted you to

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,500
make sure that these are totally

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,850
invented characters this is a caricature

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,880
so what I'm going to say next is not

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,670
at all something that is out there so

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,890
it's just a caricature right so there

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,710
are machine learners out there who are

00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,790
not engineers and they build things that

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:09,400
don't go into production ever they tend

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,440
to be pissed about that because nobody

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,930
wants to spend six months building a

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,850
model that never goes into production

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:19,300
but the tooling that they have is partly

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:23,160
responsible for that so they build

00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:27,210
things in scripting languages often on

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,140
notebooks they don't care too much about

00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,360
parallelization they just want to make

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,980
it work in one machine where the only

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,900
bottleneck is the memory on that machine

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,240
and then you can buy a big machine and

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,940
then it's somebody else's problem to

00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,810
deploy the model right and that's not a

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,130
good strategy overall so I omit plenty

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,590
of these people and there is really

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,660
capable they do so where interesting

00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:55,540
things but they're limited by their

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:57,880
engineering ability right so yeah our is

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,000
pretty popular in that camp although

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,400
it's kind of slowing down so this is a

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,310
totally subjective graph of popularity

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,130
of foreign languages in that camp

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:14,860
Escalus is getting a lot of traction

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:18,040
there very still a long way to go until

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,950
it becomes mainstream partly because

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,570
Escala is damn hard to learn more so if

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,080
you come from from an environment that

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:30,250
is not at all about engineering I did a

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,860
talk in Python in the PI data conference

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,480
here in Berlin a couple of weeks ago

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,790
basically telling people that they are

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,940
better off doing a spark in Scala and

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,010
there was a roomful of Python guys I was

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,770
suspecting to be crucified upside down

00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,140
but they actually agreed so I'm not I

00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:52,090
not surprised if this thing next year's

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:57,340
going to be somewhere here right okay

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:59,830
so packing guys so they have a big

00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:02,920
investment in Kratt so basically they

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,530
are running some website that got out of

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,450
hand but it started with something

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:10,630
innocent like a ruby on rails app that

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,830
just grew and grew and they know their

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:14,670
stuff very well

00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:17,020
they take definitely they are engineers

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,220
but they are not great outside the

00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:24,970
monolithic framework that they they

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,190
investigate right so these guys are

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,510
seeing the writing in the wall and they

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,700
are trying to do something about it it's

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:35,860
not surprising to find people doing Ruby

00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:39,430
in a functional way with with kind of a

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,290
flavor for for the kind of things that

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:46,090
you normally do in Scala but it's just

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:49,120
not a good fit okay so this animal I

00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:54,430
actually encounter less often but you

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:58,180
may have different different sample so

00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,280
the things that they end up doing is

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,540
kind of menial work and they are kind of

00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,450
okay with it because they are

00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:08,560
surprisingly comfortable living in that

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:11,070
kind of culture they tend to like

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,710
certifications and design patterns and

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:17,470
the one advantage about this group is

00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,830
that there is to find and what I see

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,430
often is people who need data engineers

00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,670
or it's kind of years basically to just

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,530
hire these people it's setting alone in

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:33,400
a room with a bunch of books and hope

00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:36,160
that they will somehow pick it up right

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,690
and this this animal I think I you'll

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,610
encounter when I come to this type of

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:45,280
conferences so this this person is

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,650
basically impossible to to hire to hire

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,260
they are all working for four light

00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:55,840
bands or on some gigantic company that

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:58,750
pays in very well that they definitely

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,790
know all these new things that you can

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,500
do to to make sky level design and

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,450
applications and so on and they're doing

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,800
them already

00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,300
but the interesting thing about them is

00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,120
that at least when I talk to them they

00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,600
are not doing any machine learning and

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,310
some of them do want to do more but they

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,590
feel that there is a big gap between

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:21,160
what they are doing and what they should

00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:23,290
be doing to do real production machine

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:28,330
learning systems so I'm going to talk a

00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:31,090
little bit about why this is here so we

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,650
have our personas and for for the rest

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:36,790
of the conversation I think we can

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:39,970
ignore the two middle ones oh actually I

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,500
think I skipped water slide but so to me

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,970
the ones are going to have problems

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,780
going in this direction or in this

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:49,810
direction so the interesting thing is

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,210
that these two things are simply hot

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,340
delivering a lot of value but it's very

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:58,240
rare to find people who can do both and

00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:03,040
I think we do need those people because

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:06,760
when you make mix teams it's really hard

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,010
to communicate so there is a mindset

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,990
that is very strong here about what is

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,120
worth doing and what is not worth doing

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:17,470
and it's definitely not the same mindset

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,720
as in this side so there are all kind of

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,550
communication problems so the best thing

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,140
will be to have a single person that can

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:28,420
it can bind this these two groups so in

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,010
the statutory we are trying to to get

00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:33,130
people in that direction but it's really

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:37,450
hard because this part alone takes quite

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,990
a bit of effort right and the

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,370
interesting thing is that when any of

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,770
these two sides look at what the other

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:49,270
one is doing they go like this right so

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:51,130
they really don't understand the while

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,850
the other group values what they're

00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:56,860
doing so much but there is something

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,500
that has happened recently that has

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,270
changed that quite a bit and that

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,280
something is a spark so a spark is built

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,260
by people who understand this group and

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,120
surprisingly they understand this group

00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:16,060
too so whereas Park is doing is really

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,030
keeping a delicate balance between

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,480
these two groups and you will see next

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:25,180
why is that delicate balance it's trying

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,680
to make these people happy and look at

00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,750
the things that they like right

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,020
and these people happy and these two

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:36,490
things are really not the same at all

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:38,650
right so just to give you an example at

00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,720
some point like two years ago or so when

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,700
you half ago it was in London at the

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:48,400
training where they Tabriz announced the

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:51,190
beta frame and you can see in the room

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,620
two groups going in completely different

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,440
emotional directions so there were all

00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,210
the scripting guys when were like hey

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,270
this is where we have data frames in

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:06,930
Python on our right and all the Scala

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:09,310
guys going like oh it's not typesafe so

00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:11,950
the thing that they did pretty well is

00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,440
to find a balance again so for a while

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,840
data frame was the new thing that

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,400
everybody wanted to do was really fast

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,120
because it's what was doing all kind of

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,640
optimizations within the sequel engine

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,170
and so on so dinner they did entities

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,180
felt kind of wrong

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:32,310
although oddities are typed and

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,930
definitely have their advantages the

00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,490
ecosystem on machine learning and so on

00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:40,170
started building on data frame and

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:43,150
ignoring heart disease but at some point

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,710
data set appeared data set has the same

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,650
API as data frame that has the

00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:51,070
advantages of heart disease it has typed

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:53,590
so now both groups are happy and that's

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:59,530
really a feat because they could not be

00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:02,650
more more different right so then what I

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,850
envision happening is that both of these

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,090
communities are going to start

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,070
converging they had both both sides I

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,750
want to start trying to learn from from

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,360
what the others are doing and why they

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,570
find it valuable

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,310
so sting in the room well the butler has

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,790
been saying for now three years or so

00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:25,539
that as spark Scala is going to become

00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:27,279
the de-facto machine learning language

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:32,200
and I keep hearing this from other

00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:35,229
people too so if he's right but we are

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,700
going to find is a huge avalanche of

00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:42,549
people coming to to ask Allah who have

00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:47,159
no real background in engineering and

00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:50,379
they have to pick it up somehow so

00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,299
Martin asked he said that about 50% of

00:21:50,379 --> 00:21:55,149
the newcomers to to this community are

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:58,509
coming because of his part so that that

00:21:55,149 --> 00:22:00,309
could be part of the reason right so

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:01,809
then there is going to be a little bit

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,019
for problem with onboarding so we're

00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:08,590
going to have situations similar to the

00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:11,669
refugee crisis so you will have plenty

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,659
of people in forums and Stack Overflow

00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:15,509
asking things that you may think like

00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:19,479
well this this doesn't make any sense

00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:22,979
and there are many of these people who

00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:26,259
want to come into the camp of well

00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:29,190
reactive everything and and it's part on

00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:31,450
on its color and so on

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:35,379
this is going to be interesting how we

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:37,690
we actually assimilate the influx

00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:39,519
because I can see it coming so there

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,820
wasn't a room as big as this one in the

00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,710
Python PI data conference and they were

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,629
all nodding when I was saying like well

00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:50,909
if you want to this part is doing in

00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:50,909
this color so these guys are coming

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:58,659
right so going in this direction is I

00:22:54,909 --> 00:23:01,929
think easier although none of the

00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:05,470
reactions is really easy but it's easier

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:07,960
because of this partnership light band

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,330
beta tan University and while the

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,759
designs retreat making these videos to

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:15,609
to make sure that people can go from

00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:19,059
this to this so the videos assume that

00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:21,429
you know what you're doing so all these

00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,720
things are not explained so nobody's

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:25,869
going to teach you well that the gray a

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,720
busted in three is but is going to show

00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:31,720
you how to run one on a spark from a

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,259
scholar and they are our language you

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,809
can check them already the 50 new ones

00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,130
they're coming in July 15th are actually

00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:42,760
pretty advanced

00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:45,190
and it's really getting challenging to

00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,950
produce them but I think that the

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,809
results is going to be very useful so if

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,460
you have 75 videos you can definitely

00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:57,850
make this transition right

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,460
the only transition though is well just

00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:03,039
before I move on

00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,990
this is twitter twitter had this problem

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,490
so they had a scholar written by people

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,929
who wish it was a ruby nice color

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,760
written by people who wish it was ever

00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:13,480
as color written by people who wished it

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:17,320
was Haskell right so this is going to

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:22,650
happen somehow with all the machine

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:25,120
learners coming to the other side so

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,440
then we do I don't have a good solution

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,480
for this but can we do anything better

00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,049
than just hire a person and drop him in

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,940
a corner of the room and just cover him

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,340
with a rail ebook and books and hope

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,480
that he is going to pick up all the

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:43,510
engineering that he's missing

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:47,169
I don't know I wish they knew right so

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:50,190
the other the other direction it's a

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:52,630
little bit harder because there are no

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,409
certified videos that teach you this

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:58,750
there are MOOCs though most up pretty

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:02,590
good everybody I interview has done

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:05,080
plenty of MOOCs and my impression is

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,799
that they don't find them so effective

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,840
so after doing a bunch of MOOCs people

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,760
kind of can't talk machine learning mal

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,890
cannot do machine learning I don't know

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,460
whether is because when I watch the

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,169
videos myself and they're pretty awesome

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,870
so how's this going to happen I don't

00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:24,250
know but I have some pointers so there

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,820
is something about the mindset of an

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,380
engineer that doesn't fit in this world

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:32,740
so I'm going to try to cover the most

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:35,860
obvious ones to me so the first thing is

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,049
that there's no spec by spec I mean a

00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,770
list of things that you have to fulfill

00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:43,840
to declare your app successful for

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,970
example something will be like well this

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,870
thing has to serve 10,000 connections

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,250
per second fine so then go and find that

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,960
the knowledge that can provide that

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,060
right

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,700
in in the world of machine learning that

00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,760
doesn't work somebody can come to you

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,440
and say well we have to classify dogs

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,310
and cats and the classification

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,320
performance has to be 95 percent and you

00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,810
can only say like I don't know if I can

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,460
do this well for that example is kind of

00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:15,720
becoming easier to say yes but anything

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,360
else that somebody asked you to predict

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,460
oh let lets let's just get the data

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,950
scientists to predict whether we are

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,680
going to do well in Asia and we'll have

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:28,020
any data about ourselves in Asia what

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,540
they cannot do anything so there are so

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,300
many things that you cannot say yes to

00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,650
when you are in data science and that

00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:39,450
doesn't happen so often in data

00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:42,240
engineering or engineering in general so

00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,410
that's the design is part of it so there

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,620
are plenty of things that can fail

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:50,460
miserably and you have to learn to live

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:52,170
with it and basically educate managers

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,960
to understand that this is the way it

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,490
works in this world another very

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,310
interesting thing about machine learning

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,830
is that when something doesn't work do

00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,230
you know how long it's going to take you

00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,380
to fix it or when it's going to work at

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,470
all so imagine that you apply your model

00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:13,650
and you got whatever 85 percent

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:16,200
performance can you get to 90 in one

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:18,960
week in one month in one year you don't

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,910
know and the obvious stakeholder

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,970
question is okay so how long do you need

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:28,650
to to get this to 95% and the only

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:31,350
answer to this is I don't know this is

00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:34,920
something that an engineer doesn't like

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,500
and cannot afford basically so

00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,080
estimations suck all over the place in

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,660
engineering but at least you you have

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,400
kind of some boundaries in data science

00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,170
you can never say I'm going to get to 95

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,210
percent because that may be impossible

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,900
and even when you have a lot of

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,730
experience you can still not predict how

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,170
well another thing is going to perform

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,170
in a particular data set

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:04,890
right so I wanted to compare how it

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,560
feels to do machine learning on a spark

00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:10,230
from a SCADA compared to other things in

00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,350
terms of features and just niceties and

00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,540
so on so one thing that is pretty

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,610
shocking when you go into this world is

00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:23,370
that there isn't that much field already

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:25,290
so this is the Python world for front

00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:30,810
for deep learning there are literally

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:34,260
tens of libraries and they can often go

00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:37,950
up and down in popularity but there is

00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,320
always something to choose from in Scala

00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:45,000
spark there's only deep learning for a

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:48,180
worse it it's not even very high but

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,070
well yeah these guys are really doing

00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,950
very well there is something very

00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:56,490
valuable and if you go tomorrow there is

00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:00,180
a talk by Andy Patrick who maybe in the

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:04,500
room about how to do deep nets on spark

00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:08,160
or at least on a scholar but look at the

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:10,350
choices that you have outside of the JVM

00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,370
sorta right this is something that you

00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:16,220
miss when you go into the other side and

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:18,810
that's the same for everything for

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,910
natural language processing libraries

00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,310
for a sparse matrix multiplication

00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,370
libraries anything you want there is

00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:31,460
either nothing or one choice and in

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:31,460
outside there is like plenty of choices

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:38,520
right so one thing that is clear by now

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:40,380
is that hadoop mapreduce is not very

00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,290
interesting there are people still doing

00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:48,090
it for 80 years old but it's not exactly

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:54,600
at best of class solution anymore so as

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:57,510
per has killed that completely one but

00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,450
but what I see here is that people are

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,620
going to spark just to do something that

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,770
they were doing already with MapReduce

00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:06,240
between it easier and that's not the

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,650
point of spark the point of spark is

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,370
that you can do so many other things

00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:12,120
that were completely ridiculous before

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,900
like

00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,160
machine learning graph analysis streams

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,890
hotel staff was completely impossible

00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,050
before and what I see people doing is

00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,750
just to compare the MapReduce jobs to

00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:27,620
aspire because it runs faster so that's

00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,620
totally missing the point

00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:34,920
right so spark was decided by people who

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,110
really knew what they were doing both in

00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:40,980
the engineering side and in the machine

00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:43,400
learning side so that shows and there's

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,800
plenty of strategies already implemented

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,790
and there is very easy to go to

00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,350
production because you are already

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:55,650
basically in the same platform that is

00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:58,070
going to be in production and people are

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,900
building on top of it so it's not only

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,840
these two libraries this was Emily was

00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,900
based on a disease a spark ml came about

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,140
the time data frames came this IBM

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:13,470
putting out a library that looks kind of

00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,850
like a DSL so it's pretty easy to use

00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,030
for people who are used to scripting

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:22,740
languages and so on and this Keystone ml

00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:25,170
is actually from from amp level it has

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,950
other advantages this kind of alpha so

00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,180
always talking about it yet but so it's

00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:34,290
starting to happen that there is no

00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:37,650
choice but like a few months ago when a

00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:41,910
year ago there was just a spark male and

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:44,520
before that only Emily so there are some

00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,830
basic ideas that are very nice very

00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,800
general so one thing that you notice

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:52,110
when you go to the other side is that

00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:56,220
people build things that are extendable

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:58,110
and that I like loosely coupled and so

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:03,660
on so the code quality is much higher

00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:10,560
than the machine learning world so these

00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:13,860
are basic pieces to build so the main

00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:17,160
advantage that I've notice going to to

00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:19,650
spark from Scala is hyper parameter

00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,630
tuning so instead of having to use only

00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,820
one machine that runs for weeks to get

00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:25,910
the best parameters for your model now

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,730
you can just go to Amazon and

00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:32,030
100 boxes and just run it in a day or

00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:35,330
half a day and that's really really a

00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:36,980
huge jump in quality of life so nobody

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,860
likes to wait for a week to get the

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,630
results and when you have to do you feel

00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,270
like you're not making progress so it's

00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:47,390
kind of boring and you get less

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,730
spectacular results because you try less

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:52,370
because it's just more boring and this

00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:54,070
comes for free with a spark so that's a

00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,670
huge win right there

00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:01,490
now the the elephant drawing is that you

00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:04,300
spend a lot of time cleaning data and

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:10,010
that's actually pretty nice in a spark

00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:11,290
so in a spark doing ETL it's comfortable

00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,890
and you're doing it from the same

00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,560
environment that you are doing your

00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,510
machine learning that's pretty awesome

00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,400
and just the last thing but it's kind of

00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,590
important too is that the models run

00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:25,370
faster so if you have a paralyzed

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:28,550
version of whatever linear SPM it just

00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:32,840
runs faster than in one machine so this

00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:35,000
is another free wing basically so so

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,720
that the gains are pretty obvious and

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,610
everybody will will like to have this so

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,700
this is why I'm expecting some crazy

00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:47,840
migration from how this Python machine

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:52,100
running guys - to spark and Scala

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,340
basically right so one thing that

00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:58,820
doesn't happen very much is people

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,510
sharing components and maybe because as

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:07,310
part moves so quickly people push things

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:10,550
asked for like requested to merge the

00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:13,130
code with with the the code base of

00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,710
spark and people just don't have the

00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,510
capacity to merge the pull requests and

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,300
they just linger there and die because

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,160
spark is has now moved and and the

00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,370
protic west will be impossible to merge

00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:33,470
anymore this is just a consequence of

00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:36,710
being moving so fast right right this is

00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:43,010
pretty interesting catching errors is

00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:45,380
far better with Scala on a spark and now

00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,960
with data set it's going to be even

00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:52,040
better so that data sets are coming in

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,960
in a spark 2.0 and that's that's

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,570
something that is Scala

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,250
only so that's one more reason for the

00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:04,700
Python guys to say hey we should

00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:07,220
consider scale right so since we were

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,720
teaching mostly Python on our for the

00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,910
first two years and the last year we

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:16,580
we've done plenty of escala we had to

00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:18,670
convert many tasks and we went tell you

00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,740
the experience that we had to in that so

00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:24,170
this task was very heavy on data

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,540
pre-processing it's a task or you have

00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,160
to predict if a university group is

00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,360
going to get a grant or not it's from

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,460
cuddle it's super dirty and it's not big

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:36,520
or interesting anyway other than it's

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,970
super nasty and you have to do a lot of

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:42,530
feature engineering this task is the one

00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,180
I mentioned before when you upload a

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,760
picture and then the system has to

00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,730
answer any question about the picture

00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,680
and the state of the art is about 70

00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,120
percent right now

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,730
pretty cool this is still ongoing oops

00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,070
this is still ongoing but it doesn't

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:02,120
look too bad so I think the move to

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,830
Scala has been positive there this

00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,350
example is sort of a competitor to

00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,680
buffer that can't recommend you who to

00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,600
follow

00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,170
not only we went to tweet but want to

00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:15,350
tweet for some badass guy that you want

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,120
to get noticed by to actually see you so

00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:20,300
this has a lot of graph analysis those

00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,640
graphics I was trying to use the the new

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,350
graph frames but it was not great so I

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,150
I'll tell you a little bit about that

00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,800
later

00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,600
so things that there are little bit

00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,940
painful is interesting categorical

00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,450
variables you have to do the index seen

00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,619
by hand sort of which is not nice at all

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:40,980
and this figures

00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:42,869
thing is also kind of nasty so

00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,440
everything that is a feature has to be

00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:52,920
in a vector format so it's very not

00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,749
pretty for humans so for pipelines

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,150
the approach is pretty much the same

00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:59,789
that people are used to in in the Python

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:01,619
world and second learn basically they

00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:06,359
cloned the pipeline's from second learn

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,849
and that's a very smart move for text

00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,980
versus in natural language processing

00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:12,539
there is a pretty much one-to-one

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,329
mapping between anything that you want

00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:19,109
to do with second learn and what you can

00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:22,440
do already with LP in Scala spark so

00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:24,480
that's very nice the graphics staff was

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,130
a little bit of a pain to get to work

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,609
mostly because we tried with reference

00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:32,130
first and that was a bad choice so car

00:37:29,609 --> 00:37:35,910
frames are not ready for for primetime

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:38,190
and graphics I hear that it's not very

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,920
maintained and may not get as much

00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,480
attention at it sure it's a pity because

00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,960
it's actually very useful to have a

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,380
graph data structure that is native to

00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,940
the entire platform right this way we

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,890
liked well the architecture is

00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,619
definitely very nice the call quality is

00:37:52,890 --> 00:38:00,779
better than what you find outside type

00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:02,700
safety of course the way pipelines and

00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:05,579
models are the same thing is also very

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:10,200
elegant the way you pass parameters is

00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:12,660
pretty nice well it's best to paralyze

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,970
ETL and to grid search so a grid search

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,339
is kind of the biggest win so if you

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:20,190
have to to find the best parameter for

00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:22,130
your model just moving to spark is a

00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,529
huge win already

00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:29,029
disappointments not so many but the

00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:29,029
feature indexing is kind of tedious

00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:38,789
right so there are some silly little

00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,650
problems like the depth of trees that

00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:43,680
are is limited to 13 which is kind of

00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:45,960
stupid visualization or data exploration

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,500
is not there you have to go to the 3 or

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,570
some something else well

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,870
be blurry is not really very advanced

00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:56,700
but these guys have moving very fast so

00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,070
just to conclude I reminded that there

00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,890
are all these videos you can access them

00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,180
through SIL this URL as well and if you

00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,100
have the time just go through them

00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,160
because it's really the easiest way to

00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,050
get into this and well thank you for

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,360
your attention and if you want to talk

00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:16,370
more we are at the booth outside share

00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,370
