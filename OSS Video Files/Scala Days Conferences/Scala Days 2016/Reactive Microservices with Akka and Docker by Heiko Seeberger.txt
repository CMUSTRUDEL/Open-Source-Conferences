Akka is a toolkit for building elastic and resilient distributed systems and Docker makes shipping and running those distributed systems easy as never before. In this talk we will briefly introduce you to the basics of Akka and Docker and then show how you can use these innovative technologies to build and run really Reactive micorservices. Donâ€™t expect too many slides, but be prepared for live demos.
