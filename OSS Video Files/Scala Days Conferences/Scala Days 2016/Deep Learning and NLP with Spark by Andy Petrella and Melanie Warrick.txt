Anstract:
Deep Learning is taking data science by storm. Unfortunately, most existing solutions aren’t particularly scalable. In this talk, we will show how we can easily implement a Spark­ ready version one of the most complex deep learning models, the Long Short­ Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, widely used in the hardest natural language processing and understanding problems, such as automatic summarization, machine translation, question answering and discourse. We will also show an LSTM demo with interactive, real­time visualizations using the Spark Notebook and Spark Streaming.
