Anstract:
Scala combines a comprehensive array of syntactic features with a rich static type system. At the intersection between Scala's syntactic versatility and its reliable type-level constraints, there exists a narrow window of opportunity for designing APIs that are both expressive and safe; for writing code that is elegant.

We will explore this unique "elegance zone" offered by Scala, with useful real-world examples from Rapture, a collection of libraries for familiar everyday programming tasks, such as working with JSON, XML, HTML and CSV, time, internationalization, logging and I/O. Rapture's philosophy is to drive forwards the state of the art in typesafety, whilst at the same time maintaining the most intuitive syntax.

Ultimately, we will show that features of Scala like implicits and type inference offer some very exciting possibilities for developing software that provides both clearer code and offers more static guarantees, and that writing elegant code in Scala is within everyone's graspâ€”this is Scala's great chance to outshine other languages!
