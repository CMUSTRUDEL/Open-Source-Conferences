Machine Learning to some is still very magical. The truth however is that this magic is actually much easier to use than you'd expect. Come and learn how you can use Apache Spark and Akka together to build a service that recommends items to users. In this session, I'm going to show you some of the bits that go into building a recommender system, how to actually implement one in Spark and finally how to integrate the recommender system into your application using Akka HTTP.
