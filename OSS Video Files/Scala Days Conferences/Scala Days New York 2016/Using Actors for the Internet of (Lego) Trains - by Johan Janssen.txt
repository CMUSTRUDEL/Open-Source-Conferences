Abstract:
Normally, we use Java or Scala to build applications for large organizations running on servers. We wanted to find out if we could use the same languages and tools on IoT hardware. We also wanted to investigate whether or not (remote) actors could replace REST endpoints. The Lego trains are equipped with a Raspberry Pi, camera, wireless dongle, infrared transmitter, speaker, RFID reader, and battery pack. Next to that, we have automated switch tracks a Lego Ferris Wheel and camera's again with the help of Raspberry Pi's. We also built some lightning effects with LEDs controlled by Particle Photonâ€™s. To control the trains and other parts, we built a remote actor based application with Scala, Akka, Akka HTTP and AngularJS. We will show you when and how to use Akka HTTP and remote actors. We will also show the results of the performance tests we did to compare the two options. Next to that we will talk about our experiences and challenges and of course we will give a live demo!
