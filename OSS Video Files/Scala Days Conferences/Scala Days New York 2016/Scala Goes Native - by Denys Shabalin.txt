Description: 
	This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.

Abstract:
Scala has historically been a JVM-centric programming language. The situation has started to change with appearance of the Scala.js that opened a door of front-end development to Scala programmers. This talk will expand the horizons of Scala even more. Weâ€™re going to announce a new ahead-of-time compiler and lightweight managed runtime designed specifically for Scala.
