Description: 
	This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.

Abstract:
The story of better metaprogramming in Scala has started in early 2013, after we released macros 1.0 and got initial feedback from early adopters. This talk will provide an illustrated guide through the history of the improvements that we did and are planning to do to metaprogramming. We will see what worked, what didn't, and what we're excited about for the future of macros in scala.meta and Dotty.
