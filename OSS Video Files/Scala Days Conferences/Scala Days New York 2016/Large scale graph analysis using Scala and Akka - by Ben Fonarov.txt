Description: 
	This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.

Abstract:
In this talk we will go over the architecture and implementation of a large-scale graph analysis engine using Scala, Akka and Hbase. Starting from the needs that led to this type of processing, weâ€™ll go through the different implementation considerations, jump into an implementation that includes a query parser and an akka cluster to do the processing, and then see how we can produce a stream output of the results. This talk could benefit anyone that is interested in Scala, Akka, Big Data, stream processing and of course graphs.
