Publication date: 2016-06-17
Playlist: Scala Days New York 2016
Description: 
	This talk was recorded at Scala Days New York, 2016. Follow along on Twitter @scaladays and on the website for more information http://scaladays.org/.

Abstract:
A collection of horror stories that derive from a lack of best practices. Everything will be covered: How to make companies lose money, shutdown systems and disable payments (or worse) just from overlooking simple procedures that "take too much time" or "cost too much" to implement. We may even dim the lights at certain points in the presentation.

	00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:11,600
this is nightmare before best practices

00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,860
this is going to be

00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,220
a different toll from all the other ones

00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,570
a few years ago I I was talking with a

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,190
friend of mine and it told me that every

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,170
time I go to a conference every time I

00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,730
give a lecture we talked about the

00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,980
success cases we talked about how we

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,350
sold things are we fixed problems we

00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,440
never talked about things that failed we

00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,760
never talked about all we screwed up and

00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,190
this is what I'm about to do I'm going

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,370
to tell you how my previous team managed

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,190
to screw up time and time again because

00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,230
through failure we also learn a lot we

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,790
can learn a lot from our mistakes but no

00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:48,170
one ever said that we can't learn from

00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:52,390
other people's mistakes if you do enjoy

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:56,089
this presentation do rate if you don't

00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,620
just send me an email seriously because

00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,659
the presentation is already been

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,220
approved for Berlin so I get to do it

00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,199
again so if there's something you don't

00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,970
enjoy about the presentation just send

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,229
me an email and say what I should change

00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:11,180
my name is jeiza I work at courtesy I

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:14,390
happen to be a magician and a card

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,490
cheetah I I don't really cheat people

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,560
for money instead I just practice a lot

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,270
i study a lot and then I do gambling

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,250
demonstrations and some miracles for my

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,140
friends so throughout the rest of the

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:29,030
day if you feel like watching a miracle

00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,799
just approach me and say surprise me to

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,600
get that out of the way I work at coda

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,340
see where an automatical review that

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,950
means we save you time in your code

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,320
reviews and we also help junior

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,939
developers learn faster if you want to

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,920
see something about colors if you want

00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,979
to see the three-minute page find me

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,359
during the day and today I'm going to

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,780
talk to you about four nightmare

00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,250
scenarios and in the end I'm going to

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,960
talk about some best practices that

00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,530
could have fixed some of those scenarios

00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,689
and unlike the movie Fargo and the TV

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,060
show with the same name this story is

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:04,880
actually true everything I'm about to

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,429
tell you actually happened exactly how

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,009
I'm about to tell it nightmare number

00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:12,380
one the developer lost one hundred and

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,880
eighty thousand euros he make this might

00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,980
be thinking how much is that in dollars

00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,500
so the developer lost two hundred

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,840
thousand dollars and the story begins

00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,910
with a new website that is a shopping

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,819
cart with a payment system and integrate

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,409
to the bank and then

00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,829
there's a successful launch and

00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:31,599
everybody is happy for about three weeks

00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:33,549
after three weeks one of the developers

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,370
decides to use the website in self and

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:38,139
your purchase and the day after he goes

00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,170
to check his bank account and he notices

00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:43,299
there's no charge on his credit card

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,280
peculiar right it goes to the the back

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:46,989
office and he finds that there's no

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
charges at all but they have been

00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,769
selling they have been sending the

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,840
product there's a guy here laughing I'm

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:56,579
betting that he even threw something

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,530
like that right this amounts to about

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:02,139
thirty four thousand dollars per week

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,829
that they've been selling that goes

00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:07,870
about ninety thousand years so far and

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,219
something's wrong and they call the bank

00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,319
and they ask what's going on and the

00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:13,000
bank explains well there are two ways of

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,449
charging customers they might have had

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,980
it you're not using any of them but wit

00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:19,719
number one is you just charge the

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,659
customer it's a simple API as a simple

00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:24,849
call to an API you pass all the data of

00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:26,530
the customer and the charge that you

00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:28,480
want to make and you just do it the

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,250
second way is if first you request a

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,109
credit approval and then you charge the

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,030
client so when you book a hotel room for

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:37,060
instance you'll see that there's a

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,030
pre-approved credit and if you're only

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,409
charged when you go to the hotel and

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,299
what we were doing was we were

00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:46,780
authorizing but we were never charging

00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,340
and the bank added by the way you only

00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,609
have one week to charge the customer

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,250
after you do the approval so that means

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:57,430
that at this point we've lost about 60

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,220
thousand euros and with if we don't act

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,280
fast we might lose thirty thousand more

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,009
of this week that goes to almost five

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,439
thousand dollars per day so every day

00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:11,259
that goes by we're going to lose an

00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,060
additional five thousand dollars did I

00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:16,180
mention that this took place at a Friday

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,620
afternoon I didn't did I I didn't

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,280
because this actually took place at a

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,889
Friday evening and now the guy realizes

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,130
which we're losing five thousand dollars

00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:31,030
per day so far we've only lost more than

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,340
that guy makes in a year and if he lets

00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,409
do we can go by that's almost fifteen

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,020
thousand dollars more so he has to

00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,800
quickly fix things but I did tell you

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,240
that this guy

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,340
lost two hundred thousand dollars and so

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,530
far we only saw him lose a hundred

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,930
thousand and that's where the real

00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,530
trouble started with the words you can

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:52,509
use this code to fix it someone sends

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,310
him a script saying we had a similar

00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:56,020
problem in the past we solved it with

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,490
this script you can use it as well so

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,060
the guy quickly hack something together

00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,949
it liked running during the weekend and

00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,360
I figured if I'm going to run this for

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:06,909
the past week maybe I can run this for

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,530
the past three weeks it might work so on

00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:10,750
Monday morning goes to his bank account

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,099
and finally thankfully see something

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,139
that is a transaction with the right

00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:18,789
amount of money but unfortunately it's a

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:22,300
refund this is the best product launch

00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:24,819
ever if they advertise this on TV would

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,590
be selling like crazy you buy something

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:27,789
you don't pay for it you get the product

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,909
and then they send your money to your

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,449
bank account and that's how we get to

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:37,030
two hundred thousand dollars and why

00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:39,940
because the APR on the on the bank side

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:43,120
that had all of these methods but they

00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,190
all connected to the same endpoint they

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,310
were all the same one and somewhere

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,009
along the way there was this action ID

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,440
that told the bank what we wanted to do

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,900
so by using a previous script

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,509
undocumented untested that happened to

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,520
be a script to issue refunds to solve a

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:03,969
different problem the guy managed to

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,199
refund everybody and that's how we lost

00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:10,539
all of this money alright well almost it

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,789
did lose the money but then another guy

00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,279
came in and that guy managed to blame

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,289
the bank and managed to get the bank to

00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,460
solve the situation on their side and I

00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,169
imagined that the reason they did this

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,810
was because we were a really huge

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,430
company with 12,000 employees and I

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,560
imagine that for the bank to lose this

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,270
amount of money would be way better than

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,330
to lose all the business they had with

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,800
us what happened basically was that

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,960
there was no serious testing done

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,759
whatsoever no code review on the project

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,310
no code review on the script obviously

00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,370
undocumented code we're leasing on

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,590
Friday is always a bad idea although in

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,889
this case it was a quick fix it was

00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:51,099
fixing a bug so you had to do it and

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:52,009
they absolutely don't ever do this thing

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,809
is

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:56,059
running untested code just because

00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:58,999
summers somebody says this will solve

00:06:56,059 --> 00:07:01,849
your problem let's move to nightmare

00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:04,399
number two this was a conference supper

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:07,909
code bits we're talking 1,000 attendees

00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,189
free registration but applications are

00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:12,199
moderated so you might get in you might

00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:13,939
not get in and every year a lot of

00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:16,610
people didn't get in and at the core of

00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,649
the event we had the event lasted for

00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,309
three days 24 hours a day it was massive

00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:24,620
huge insane at the core of the event

00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:26,389
there was a 48-hour competition at the

00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,360
end of the competition each product

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,409
project each team at 90 seconds only to

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,309
present and the users the attendees

00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:36,800
1,000 of them would vote on the

00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:40,069
presentations and this is a nightmare in

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,199
three parts chapter number one the

00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:43,759
visitor on the first day and this is a

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,620
very simplified version of the back

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,620
office on the first day registration

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,599
opens people get in and I go to see the

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,839
back office a nice i find myself I'm

00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,159
approved I checked in I see my boss is

00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,999
been approved the ez'n check day and

00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,309
even though he's been in the building

00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:00,620
for a few days now and then I see this

00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:03,919
other guy who has not been approved but

00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,589
still managed to check in this was a

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,569
security expert who declined to provide

00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:11,269
any information on his application so he

00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,189
was declined but he still got there he

00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:15,680
went to the registration desk he said

00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:17,240
his name somebody did a quick search his

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,159
name popped up there was a line saying

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,139
that this guy can get in but that person

00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,209
didn't even realize that hit the button

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:25,490
check in everything worked in the guy

00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:27,620
walked in and for the next three days

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,599
the guy went silent no messages on

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,279
facebook on Twitter anything the guy was

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,560
inside the building we had no idea what

00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,289
it looked like who he was anything and

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,229
this could result in a public relations

00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,579
nightmare because there are every almost

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,339
everybody inside the building knows

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:45,310
someone who wasn't accepted so if they

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,420
know that there's someone inside that

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,670
shouldn't be there they're going to be

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,160
angry at us and also if that guy said it

00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,319
tells their friends about this a lot of

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,480
people could show up this is the kind of

00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:59,449
people that I have only seen on shows

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,380
like mr. robot I would love to have met

00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:05,480
this guy we never found any chapter

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,870
number to the anonymous tip

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,940
so everyone has a profile and on the

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:13,070
back office you can edit the profile and

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,839
we got an email from someone saying a

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,760
couple of my friends weren't accepted

00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,480
and I'm really pissed at this because

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,000
two guys are there bragging that they

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,350
had this amazing idea one of them didn't

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
even apply to the event the other one

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,829
did it was accepted but he's not going

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,269
to be able to be there so instead what's

00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:31,940
they going to do is they're going to

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,360
change the picture of that guy so that

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,910
the other one can go on a 10 it's awful

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,260
and we have never thought about this we

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,860
get notifications for all of these

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,350
fields except the photo we managed to

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,180
solve the issue we introduced a quick

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,620
fix and we send an email to those guys

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,560
telling them they wouldn't be able to

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:55,040
attend they never showed up and chapter

00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,079
number 3 voting this is part of the

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,639
attend either the attendees this is a

00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,220
group finishing their presentation

00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:05,540
there's four seconds left to vote eighty

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:10,040
votes in favor 49 votes against this

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:12,079
consumes an immense amount of time if we

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,760
have 90 projects in 90 seconds that's

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,430
over two hours of project presentations

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,110
no one wants to go through that if we

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:23,420
had ten seconds per project to vote

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,610
that's two two and a half hours so every

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,380
10 seconds it's 15 minutes more and you

00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,569
want to have the same attendance in the

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,310
beginning and in the end but

00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:33,380
unfortunately when you launch this thing

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,209
we realize that we are on we have only

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,790
tested with just a couple of people

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,170
voting at the same time and the system

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:43,970
simply didn't work with a thousand

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:46,730
attendees so we had an unauthorized

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,110
entry on the first day we had a bunch of

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,730
security flaws and we had an amazing

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,699
security team we just didn't involve

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:55,160
them in this project and we have part we

00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:57,290
had part of the website down and why

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,209
because we weren't testing anything we

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,490
we didn't account for the security

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:05,120
issues and there was clearly no stress

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,500
testing done and now a different kind of

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,209
nightmare a nightmare that takes place

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,040
before the actually coding begins we

00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,019
decided to do a travel website so it's

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,899
based on a specific content provider and

00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,310
the website is going to have countries

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,290
and cities places you can visit

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:25,010
and a lot of information on those places

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:28,220
including for instance photos so we set

00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:30,200
everything up we do the specification we

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,930
do the budget for the project that gets

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,470
approved and then after everything is

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,970
ready for coding someone says we'd like

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,420
to use a different service for photos

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,070
and this gets approved before coding

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,050
begins there's just one tiny little

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,110
detail the original services uses

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,640
location like these and the new one uses

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:56,270
GPS coordinates and the location radios

00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:58,640
you could from a location ID get a GPS

00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,690
coordinate but that's a bit tricky

00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,310
because there are two schools of

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,870
thoughts the centroids and capitals

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,970
eccentric means that you're using the

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:07,190
GPS coordinate at the center of what

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,980
you're looking at and the capital it's

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,529
basically the capital of a country now i

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,360
come from portugal so europe right over

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:17,300
here this is what my country looks like

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,270
the capital is right here and that is

00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,040
the center of the country and if I'm

00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,020
using GPS coordinates and if i want to

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,330
find interesting photos of the country

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,500
i'm going to have to use radius and it's

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,870
probably going to be a big radius

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,420
because before i get to the capital i'm

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,570
going to get to Spain that's not what I

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,610
want so I'm going to have to use a very

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:40,160
small radius that's just one tiny little

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:44,240
detail at the very core of my country

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,830
for some reason we have this I I don't

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,310
even know what that is but that marks

00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,470
the center of Portugal if we ever get

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,000
involved in a war with Spain and if we

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,690
lose or gain some terrain we're going to

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,460
have to ship this thing you know so

00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,980
that's not going to work but what about

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,720
capitals if we go to google and search

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,820
for the coordinates of Portugal it gives

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,450
us coordinates that happen to be in put

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:11,540
in Lisbon but they happen to be not what

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:13,010
I expected because if I'm telling you to

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,270
go to postural this is what I'm showing

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,400
you i'm showing a lot of beautiful

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,990
things that you can see there i am not

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,800
showing you this street that I was even

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:25,100
not a well and I decided just as a

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,330
thought experiment to go into google

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,050
street view and see what i could find

00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:31,880
there and this is it and it's not as bad

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,139
if when you can see that the opposite

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,359
side of the road

00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:40,339
you know just come to Portugal this is

00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:42,619
what we have for you I also did a couple

00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:44,119
more experiments I found out that at the

00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:47,269
very center of spain they sell

00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:49,129
electronic equipment also the very

00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,199
center of Brazil is very similar to the

00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:53,720
centre of finland the shape of the

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,399
houses change of it what I wasn't

00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,859
expecting was to find at the very center

00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:02,989
of Japan an elevator but on closer

00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:05,209
inspection it's not really an elevator

00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:06,919
there's a door handle over there that

00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:09,290
sign says staff only and this is an

00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:11,869
emergency exit I have no idea why a

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,220
country at its very center decides to

00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:18,199
install an emergency exit for staff only

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,699
you might find it funny that I come from

00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,779
a country where this is the center

00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:26,720
however I want to look for the center of

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,730
New York City and just so you know it's

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,619
not the Empire State Building it's not

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:37,399
Central Park it's not the Statue of

00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:39,829
Liberty it's this thing so before the

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:41,720
project even started we had a wrong time

00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:44,449
estimation additional technical issues

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,040
to solve and we were definitely going to

00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:49,069
be unable to meet the deadline because

00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,299
it was a very very tight deadline guess

00:14:49,069 --> 00:14:54,769
what the project never even started and

00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:56,839
this was all due to changes in the

00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:00,949
specification that will not accounted

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:04,699
for and now something you've probably

00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:06,350
seen before in two chapters this is the

00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:09,639
last nightmare then we get into the best

00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,290
practices chapter one the laptop a

00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,959
payments platform the one from which the

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,999
other script came from and the payments

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,759
platform work really well until the

00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:24,189
developer went on vacation and someone

00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:27,439
closed his laptop now payments stopped

00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:29,149
no one knew why and unfortunately the

00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:31,069
developer didn't believe in in cell

00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:32,660
phones so we couldn't reach him if we

00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:34,789
could have reached him we might have

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:39,379
known that somewhere in this computer

00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:43,009
was an SSH tunnel connecting two servers

00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:47,899
and that's why it stopped chapter number

00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:49,549
two there's a newsletter platform and a

00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,289
client asks us for a new platform and

00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:53,689
you say yes we'll get it ready by next

00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:56,569
week so everything is in place as a

00:15:53,689 --> 00:15:59,349
campaign on TV right ready to go but

00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:02,959
then they tell us we're talking about

00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:06,049
260,000 subscribers and here I say that

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,059
all the emails have to be sent delivered

00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,589
actually in less than an hour but that

00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:12,919
was the compromise what they wanted was

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:15,799
for a quarter of a million subscribers

00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:18,559
to get their newsletters at one o'clock

00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:20,479
precisely and I remember asking the guys

00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,609
but why at one o'clock began they said

00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,159
because the product is called at one

00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:27,559
o'clock they want people to read the

00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:29,979
newsletter as they were having lunch and

00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,029
unfortunately our newsletter platform

00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:33,529
wasn't able to handle that and you

00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,949
wouldn't be able to fix it in time

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,809
because the platform was so huge so

00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:42,079
instead we decided to go with a

00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:44,329
temporary solution great idea right so

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,639
the newsletter goes live and everything

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:51,559
works for a moment for a few days until

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:53,600
the developer goes on vacation and when

00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,359
he goes on vacation we have no

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,729
newsletter this developer didn't have a

00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:02,389
laptop so it couldn't be an SSH SSH

00:16:58,729 --> 00:17:05,149
tunnel we connected to the machine to

00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:06,829
see what was going on and we didn't find

00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,990
anything relevant but we did find a

00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:13,039
screen session and that's never a good a

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,959
good sign we managed to go on to is bash

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,689
history and see what kind of comments he

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,879
was running on the screen session and

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:22,429
that took us to a database where we

00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:24,620
found this we knew that the newsletter

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:26,059
had three segments we could see that on

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,210
the previous day there were three

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:31,070
segments three different registers that

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,320
on the status column there was a DI

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:37,039
assumed by then that the deal would

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,480
stand for delivered and then we see that

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,149
there are three segments to be delivered

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,700
today but there's something here sudden

00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:45,950
that's odd so I figure I'm going to

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,010
delete this line and thankfully it

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,470
worked

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,750
it worked and then after the guy came

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,660
back we figured out what had happened so

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,340
since someone said temporary solution

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:58,140
the guy did something like this there

00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,880
was a text area instead of a combo box

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,190
where someone who type the name of the

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,800
segment and then the person would press

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,900
the button send newsletter and why was

00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,790
it working why he had it never failed

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,220
until then well for the same reason that

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,350
the guys stop having lunch with us he

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,360
would sit at his laptop waiting to see

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,890
if someone would make a typo and if

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,920
someone would make a mistake he would

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:23,730
fix it and then he goes on vacation and

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,700
forgets tell us about it so the words

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,950
temporary solution payments stopped in

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,140
one case a newsletter wasn't sent and

00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:33,030
basically because there was an absence

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,930
of deployment methodologies and also an

00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:38,880
absence of documentation now best

00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,890
practice you may might think that best

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,290
practices exist because people are done

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:46,310
I believe that sometimes best practices

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,570
exist because people are too smart and

00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,670
when people are too smart they tend to

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,860
make miss make mistakes on the the

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,990
opening keynote Martin said sometimes

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,060
people have the idea okay this is a

00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,710
great idea no one thought about this

00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,850
before but it must be a good idea

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:05,760
nonetheless and back where I work people

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,580
were so brilliant we had a huge team two

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,800
hundred developers they were so smart

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,490
that we didn't have a lot of best

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,560
practices we allowed everyone to use

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,410
whatever best practices they felt would

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,530
be best for them and in some cases they

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,850
were good and some they were not if I

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,680
could recommend just a few best

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,960
practices i would go with technical

00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,880
specification from the beginning coding

00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,920
standard Standards code with you

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,600
definitely and I'm talking both peer

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,800
review and automatic code review and I

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,570
know that I happen to work at an

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,950
automated code review platform but trust

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,980
me I'm not trying to pass any kind of

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,860
subliminal image but just in case I'm

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,790
going to do it again

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,330
and also testing a deployment

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:54,110
methodology in place and obviously

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,730
documentation now that gives me a bit

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,620
more time to get into what i really want

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,190
to talk i want to talk about and that is

00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:04,549
best practices there are some style

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:06,200
guides that i can strongly recommend the

00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,620
opening keynote was by the data data

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,980
breaks and they have this style guide

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,420
online and it's interesting because it's

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,620
different from the other ones and it's

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,890
different from the other ones because

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,460
they have over 800 contributors on spark

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:25,100
and they figure that issues are problems

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,640
bugs i introduced not when the features

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:31,549
are initially developed but later on so

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,190
the highest priority is going to be make

00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:35,780
making sure that when you change the

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:37,190
code you're going to understand what was

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,270
there before and you're not going to

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:44,330
make a mistake but there are other

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,070
standards paypal also has a style guide

00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,530
line out there and there's also the

00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:52,360
scholar style style guide and also

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:55,160
effective skallon from twitter and

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,320
they're the kind of address the same

00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,820
issues not all of the same issues but

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,380
they do it differently and it's

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,960
interesting to see the differences in

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,390
between these standards choices if you

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,970
take something as simple as the the

00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,090
maximum line length will see that in

00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,429
some cases they go to 100 characters 100

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,230
characters again then we go down to 80

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:17,929
characters and then a twitter they say

00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,160
are 160 characters it's like they saying

00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:22,580
we have a lot of money when you get to

00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,230
afford bigger screens you know but it's

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,929
different and there are reasons behind

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,990
this and by the way if you happen to use

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:33,049
code as you can enforce most of these

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:35,720
this style guides already but if we look

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:38,750
at something like comments comments are

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,049
available in every language if you want

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,790
to see static analysis tools from

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:45,500
different programming languages would

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:51,440
you expect to see the same patterns or

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:54,260
different patterns with Ruby for

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
instance there's a pattern for asking

00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,600
comments that's to enforce that comments

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,980
are written

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,470
asking and it kind of makes sense

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,280
because you know we're really comes from

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,480
right so you don't want to see kanji in

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,810
the comments you're not going to be able

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:12,500
to figure that out probably there's a

00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:15,290
bunch of other patterns stuff like for

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,810
instance ensuring that our government

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,890
has a leading space but if you change to

00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,510
a different language for instance

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,340
JavaScript it's going to be a bit

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,160
different you're going to find different

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,870
patterns for instance enforcing empty

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,730
lines around comments and that tells you

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,650
a bit of where JavaScript comes from and

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,720
what kind of really breathability they

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:35,780
try to aim for when they design these

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,440
tools some of them are going to be

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,850
similar but some are not for instance

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,960
white space at the beginning of a

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,270
comment is something different in

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,890
JavaScript they allow you to say whether

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,770
you want to require the white space or

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:50,930
just prohibit Dwight wet space if you go

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,450
to Java you have a bunch of patterns

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,980
this is just page one that's page you

00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,660
and you get stuff like for instance

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,550
prohibiting politically incorrect

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,860
comments which also tells you a bit

00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,660
about Java this actually prevents you

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:09,350
from writing whoever wrote this was an

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:11,390
idiot drilling down just a little bit to

00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,460
the comments they're all so different

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,770
from language to language in Java we're

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,600
looking for fixed mian to do if we go to

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:21,530
scala we're looking for fix me and to do

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,190
with a little different case sensitive

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:27,260
options and we can also say i want to

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,180
look right whether it's lowercase

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,490
uppercase whatever if we go to

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,870
javascript it's a bit more tricky

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,300
because we're looking for to do to fix

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,580
me and XXX for some reason its case

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,160
insensitive by default and you can also

00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,890
search for those patterns in the middle

00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,940
of the comment not just in the beginning

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:47,060
it also tells you a bit about the

00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:51,170
language and what about regular

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:53,480
expressions what would you expect to

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,460
find regarding really regular

00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,980
expressions in different languages so if

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,140
we go to ruby for instance they only

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,820
have two patterns one in robocop and one

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:05,090
in berkman the one embankment which is a

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,310
security tool is to private and safe reg

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,590
exes that means if you're going to do a

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:13,100
search on a regex that the you

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:15,559
sir as sent you this pattern is going to

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,100
help you prevent denial of service

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:21,620
attack the ambiguous regex literal as

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,440
something to do with Ruby itself because

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,850
there is a way that the regular

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,590
expression is going to be am bigger than

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,669
when you read it you're not going to be

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,159
sure whether it's a regular expression

00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:33,590
or not if you go to JavaScript you have

00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,750
a bunch of different patterns and this

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,210
all makes sense in the world of

00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,500
JavaScript first is prohibiting an

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,150
invalid regular expression in a

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,039
different language you think the

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,380
compiler or the interpreter is going to

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,669
warn me about this when I try it but

00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,350
here you're sending your code to the

00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:51,309
user and it's going to run there so you

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,809
may not be aware of what's happening and

00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:55,730
something like this but hitting spaces

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,020
and regular expressions from where

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,159
you're standing do you know how many

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,960
spaces there are between foo and bar so

00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,210
the idea here is that you just type one

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,159
space and then between curly braces you

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,190
type the number of spaces that you want

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,440
because it's going to be more readable

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:14,659
what about Java there's a bunch of

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,309
different ones and some of them have to

00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:17,570
do with Java itself which is a file

00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:19,159
separate is something that has to do

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,960
with the fact that you might be running

00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,710
your code on Windows or Linux and the

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,630
file separate is going to be different

00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,610
how many regular expressions patterns

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:33,130
would you expect from a language such as

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:37,429
pattern it is such as Python any guesses

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:39,830
it comes down to zero and i asked the

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:41,720
main maintainer of pilings why and he

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:45,610
said let us know why there's no reason

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,289
simply no one ever thought it would be

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,140
relevant to do it it's not something

00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:54,140
that we demand which gets us to Pearl

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,890
and I apologize in advance for the font

00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,419
size but for less a bunch of regular

00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:03,080
patterns for regular expressions and

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:06,860
they all ever reasoning behind them and

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:09,169
the reason it came up in Pearl because

00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,809
pearl people did so much work with

00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:14,240
regular expressions but most of these if

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,950
not all you could take them to different

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,020
languages you could implement them in

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:22,220
different static analysis tools so I

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,430
would say that the only reason they're

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,470
not variant is that

00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:31,380
we just simply didn't get it haven't

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:33,330
gotten around to it yet I'm going to

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,920
leave some links here as well I'm

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,750
approaching the end of the talk I'm

00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,970
going to leave some links here you don't

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,010
have to nottin done or anything I'm just

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,800
making sure that whenever the slides are

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:45,210
up you're going to get access to this so

00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,970
this is some information on best

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,800
practices across languages I decided to

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:54,510
include the links to the skull guides as

00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:56,790
well and I would appreciate some

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,980
feedback on the session I know you're

00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:03,230
free to tell me you still have 10

00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,610
minutes more that part I already know

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:16,710
that means I do have a few minutes for

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:18,600
questions yes when you mean technical

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:23,550
standards you mean the coding standards

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:25,860
or we are as you were meeting in the

00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:27,450
stand she said that some standard record

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,950
having an additional coding standards

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,840
for review techniques that are you said

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:38,100
technical standard so I wonder what you

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:42,420
made let me go back to that slide I'd

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:45,930
say this is here we are yes technical

00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,220
specification from experience to start a

00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,310
project without knowing what you're

00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,960
doing is usually a bad idea I would

00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,730
recommend doing it if you're not really

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,290
sure what you want to do and if you're

00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:59,070
just deliberating on a proof of concept

00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:01,500
let's go but if you're really starting a

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,940
big project that has a goal you should

00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:08,670
have a technical specification to know

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:11,580
what you're aiming at yes a document a

00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:13,500
document not a cellular document what I

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,030
found was at some point we started doing

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,820
this with tickets with a ticketing

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:20,130
system and that allowed us halfway

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,860
through the project to tell people on

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,180
the product side sure you're asking for

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,760
this change but if you look at the

00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,530
history that was what you asked

00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,880
originally and then you asked us to

00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,980
change and are you asking us to change

00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:34,770
back again and this is going to cost

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,800
some more time that's also going to

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:42,040
allow the developers to defend them

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,410
yes kodad City the static analysis is a

00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:47,399
web service and I wonder how he solved

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:50,289
the problem that people would like that

00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:54,220
incorporations of things that service

00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:56,830
the excess like like I said public get

00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,429
love or even a private repositories it's

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,919
a enterprise get inside under this

00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:05,019
capacity oh that's simple we have an

00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:06,820
enterprise motion you can install you on

00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:10,360
your servers it connects to get AB

00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:17,279
enterprise hit live enterprise although

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:20,200
all the tools it into a lot of static

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,330
analysis tools but the number one

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:29,639
problem i have is with people and

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:29,639
needles they always a positive message

00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:37,340
happy

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,340
join the process yeah

00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:47,929
our kind of I've heard the same

00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:50,419
complaint for many people so it's egos

00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:54,650
and how people react to code review so

00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:56,350
to what you tell them about coitus with

00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:58,909
the last time I had in my previous job

00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:01,700
there was this guy I found it amazing

00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:03,830
that this guy could actually separate

00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,500
himself from his coat and when you

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:09,169
complain about his coat you were also

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:12,049
insulted code if you like this is really

00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:14,690
crappy you it's like II would forget any

00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:17,570
he was the one who wrote it and that's

00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:19,909
the way to go you know because you're

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:24,169
doing your job and it's whatever was on

00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:26,179
your mind at that time there was a guy

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:28,580
who spoke with us just a few weeks ago

00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:31,340
and he had a similar problem he was

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,500
working he had a bunch of open source

00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,960
tools big open source tools and he

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:39,049
wanted to deal with contributors but he

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,240
wanted to do it in a polite way so it

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:44,330
doesn't want to say look I want your

00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,600
code I want your patch but I don't want

00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:49,909
it the way this because you suck so he

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,919
wants to say should just fix this and

00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:55,100
his idea was if I introduce something

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:57,590
like courtesy what's going to happen is

00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:00,890
that instead of the guy seeing someone

00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:02,780
say this code is not good enough it's

00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:05,090
going to be an automatic message that

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,450
the guy is going to see in our case the

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:11,960
message is going to be the disk Amit is

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,470
not the quality on this commit it could

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:19,070
be a little bit better I think that's it

00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:22,600
so we're trying to not confront people

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:25,549
you know so we give them a list of of

00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,539
the the issues and then we try to give

00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:30,020
them all the information that they

00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:33,140
require to solve the problems we explain

00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:37,100
why it's an issue how to solve it etc so

00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,270
that they will not give up but it's an

00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,100
ongoing problem with the ongoing

00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:43,970
solutions

00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,970
this way to speak to

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,970
so what we found is that engravable

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,610
reviews were there is not a missional

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,710
checking the rules like someone raises w

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,980
hey you're doing this wrong so please

00:31:54,710 --> 00:32:00,490
get personal Tracy but because machines

00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,490
telling you

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,119
violent you so far

00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:08,069
and where does

00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:12,539
which we don't agree with the style

00:32:08,069 --> 00:32:15,179
Oracle's that we can go there so i think

00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:19,669
it was pretty well for anyone he still

00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,669
needs like fearful movies for

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:31,280
yes what we yeah exactly what we found

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,990
was that by using a tool such as

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
courtesy you're going to save time in

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,700
your code movie because the color you

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,559
only starts after all of those is

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,570
smaller issues get out of the way and

00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:44,390
then you only have to look at the actual

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:52,809
implementation and say this might not be

00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:52,809
the best way of solving this yes

00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:02,260
especially using language like Scala to

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,260
just right here

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:13,920
I forget who said that clearcoat would

00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:16,380
not need comments and to a to a certain

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,540
extent I would agree that if the code is

00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,400
readable you don't have to explain the

00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,920
code but you might have to explain the

00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,200
reasoning behind the code so i would

00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,610
agree that in some cases you're gonna

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,550
have to explain something so that

00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:33,300
someone six months ahead maybe even you

00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:36,200
again looking at the code again will be

00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:39,950
easily understand why it's done that way

00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,580
but other than that i always suggest

00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:46,559
investing a lot of time into documenting

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,780
every single procedure how the whole

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,860
system works together how you can use

00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:55,080
the everything and if i were to choose

00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,540
every single project would begin by

00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,490
writing the documentation first and then

00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,040
by writing tests that that's just a

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,840
personal opinion its documentation

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:10,409
driven development and also test driven

00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:13,290
development so if there are any other

00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,620
questions thank you very much and I'll

00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,620
