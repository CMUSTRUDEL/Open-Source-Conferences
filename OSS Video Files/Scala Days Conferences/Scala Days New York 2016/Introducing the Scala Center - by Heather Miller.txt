	00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,040
so let's get started

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,779
my name is Heather Miller I am the

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,570
executive director of the Scala Center

00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:16,520
at EPFL and as you can tell this talk is

00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,099
all about the Scala Center I'm really

00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,009
really proud to date to be presenting

00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:23,869
this this this thing that we worked so

00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:26,810
hard to put together in the last few

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:29,119
months and I hope that everybody here

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,460
will think just like I do that hey it's

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,689
a cool thing and a good idea so I hope I

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,140
can convince you of that

00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:39,580
but just to give a quick one-line intro

00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,170
to what it is the Scala Center is a new

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,840
not-for-profit Center established at

00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:47,600
EPFL so this is kind of weird what this

00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,120
thing is we launched about a month and a

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,890
half ago so we're very new and I'm going

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,350
to go through and the rest of this talk

00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,730
some of the things that we've been doing

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,620
you know just before and since we've

00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,080
launched and some of the things that

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:03,350
we're going to go on to do and how we're

00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,610
organized and and how we should be doing

00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,700
things that should be hopefully

00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,890
affecting you as developers in the end

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,390
but first the first two points I'd like

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,450
to make is that this is a not-for-profit

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:17,810
thing as is very bold on the screen and

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,759
that it's established at EPFL so EPFL is

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,310
a university I know you guys might have

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,990
heard EPFL here or there somewhere maybe

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,909
you don't know what it is it's a

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,429
university in Switzerland where actually

00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,200
we have nothing to do with with typesafe

00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:32,869
or like been people have kind of been

00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,369
confusing us for years now we are very

00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,689
different we this is where we are this

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:39,679
is what our university looks like we are

00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:42,889
nowhere near San Francisco and we don't

00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:44,869
do we don't do startup things we you

00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:47,420
know before the Scala Center existed we

00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:49,130
are a research group Martin is was the

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,179
professor in this group he is the

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,560
professor I hope are you still the

00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,929
professor I hope so

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,240
he's a he was he was my adviser for my

00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,759
PhD he advises several other people we

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,319
all contributed to Scala Scala was

00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,630
developed here actually in this

00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,700
beautiful view Martin always had some

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,219
good inspiration when he was packing on

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,479
his compiler and actually you know this

00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,399
is where this is actually the

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,069
inspiration for the Scala logo this is a

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,410
building that some of our offices are in

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:18,760
so this is EPFL and the sky

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,440
Center is at EPFL it's at a university

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,400
so why a center

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,080
Martin Martin tried to sort of you know

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,610
give give some some hints why we should

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,190
why we should have a center now it is

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,630
one was was while Scala is growing in

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,390
popularity if you look at the last few

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:40,150
years even in the last year we've this

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:43,610
is a the plot from indeed.com about

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,380
basically a job job ads of job ads

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,780
mentioning Scala and if you look in the

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,790
last year we've basically doubled the

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,710
number of job ads that you know are

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,750
mentioning Scala and actually what I

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,060
find I accidentally found that was I

00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,860
think kind of funny is that Scala is

00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,600
actually more common in job job ads than

00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,610
advertisements for data scientists even

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,050
which I was sort of surprised maybe this

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,790
isn't true but I would thought wow

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,040
that's cool and also there's a funny

00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,600
correlation here between data science

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,910
and Scala which I suspect to have

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,920
something to do with SPARC probably so

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,810
you know if you're interested in why

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,420
that might be the case a quick shout-out

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,490
to a sedin Wampler and andrey patella

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,620
andy Petrella who will be giving a talk

00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,710
actually in the very next session about

00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,060
you know today arguing that this is

00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,130
indeed true that scala is sort of the

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,810
lingua franca for data science maybe he

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,340
can explain why this is the case but

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,610
anyway the point is that scala is

00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,680
growing right and actually also you know

00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,630
despite some some like rumbles that

00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,280
we've been hearing over social media in

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,380
the last few years it's actually one of

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,750
the top five most loved languages

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,880
according to this I think it's very

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,590
influential this this this Stack

00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,220
Overflow developers survey they fit the

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,610
Stack Overflow interview or surveyed

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,530
more than 50,000 developers about

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,970
basically everything about the languages

00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,980
that they use in their jobs their job

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,540
titles I mean even up to like

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,880
demographic information how much people

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,709
get paid and they found that Scala is

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,300
not one of the most dreaded it's

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,700
actually one of the most loved languages

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,170
which is very cool and that's also not

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,580
to mention something I think is also

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,140
neat not to mention the fact that Scala

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,590
is tied with SPARC for being the highest

00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,450
paid for being the highest paid skill in

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,400
the industry right now here in the US

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,530
which is also pretty cool so obviously

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,540
there's there's a demand if the price is

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,030
so high for a scholar developer so Scala

00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,560
is growing and

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,540
it's it's it's successful I think we can

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,330
all agree that Scala is becoming very

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,500
successful but unlike every other very

00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,470
successful open source programming

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,030
language or framework until now we've

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,720
had really no not-for-profit

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,210
vendor-neutral

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,880
sort of steward thing or thing that sort

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,100
of takes care and helps Scala and its

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,020
ecosystem grow light Ben does an amazing

00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,960
job guaranteed stability of the 2x

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,610
compiler they've been dealing with all

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,560
kinds of very important things like Java

00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,900
8 compatibility efforts speeding up

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,240
Scala C being steadfast on leading the

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,100
the charge on releases which is a

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,860
ridiculously difficult job by the way

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,810
anybody who ever has ever released

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,720
something used by a lot of developers

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,490
it's extremely not easy and and you know

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,300
everything from bug fixes to the process

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,860
and how to do it

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,210
they brought binary compatibility to

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,430
Scala I mean we didn't really have that

00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:22,150
before the type safelight Ben team

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,790
brought it to us so that's really great

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,230
the only thing is you know Scala is

00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,780
getting to be a little bit bigger than

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,360
the 2x compiler alone

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,210
and and you know we now compile to

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,980
JavaScript and hopefully soon to LLVM

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,140
and also speaking of LLVM if you're

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,630
curious what that even means Dennis

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,000
where are you Dennis is giving a talk

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,010
tomorrow right tomorrow afternoon about

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,160
his projects called Scala native which

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,510
is about compiling down to LLVM so we've

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,660
got all of these cool things kind of

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,610
happening we also have you know we need

00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,770
to invest effort in other places in

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,230
addition to alternate backends you know

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,360
the the standard library needs a little

00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,560
bit of attention you know as Martin

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,300
mentioned yesterday there's this idea of

00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,500
splitting into quarter platform we need

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,120
to invest some effort in the community

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,160
ecosystem that we haven't really done so

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,070
much in the last few years and of course

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,400
we have this this awesome but also

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,630
confusing dotty thing like like on the

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,670
horizon what are we going to do about

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:23,060
this we need to invest some effort in

00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:26,330
some of these things so so why is Center

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,900
well that's why so the Scylla Center has

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,180
been founded with two goals to prime

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,710
goals one is open source community and

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,380
I'm gonna go into exactly what I mean by

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,940
that and the other is education so we

00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,529
have two main foci but if you guys walk

00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,509
away with anything

00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:47,359
I really hope that you walk away with

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:51,199
like you know this little sentence here

00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:53,119
because as a not-for-profit Center we

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,469
are really I mean our stakeholders are

00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:56,059
you guys our stakeholders are everybody

00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:58,159
so it's really for the good of everybody

00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:59,539
and when I say community I mean

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,339
everybody so at this point I think it's

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,649
really important to note that whether

00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:05,359
you're a big very slow moving kind of

00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,769
enterprise company or you're this

00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:09,079
brilliant weekend tinkerer

00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:11,209
let's translating academic functional

00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,329
programming ideas from some Oleg paper

00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:15,589
to Scala whoever you are

00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,119
the Scala centers as a non-profit

00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:19,429
Stewart is committed is committed to

00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,929
acting and interest really everybody so

00:07:19,429 --> 00:07:25,029
what we were trying to do is trying to

00:07:20,929 --> 00:07:28,519
develop things like tools or change or

00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:31,489
lead sort of community processes do this

00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:32,959
this core platform split that we had

00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:35,359
mentioned earlier all of these things

00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,719
should affect everybody we hope so this

00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:39,889
is our mission statement and I'm just

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,219
going to hammer this into your heads

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:42,829
okay

00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:44,299
ready let's go so point one

00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,829
independently guide and support the

00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:47,869
entire scala community so like I said

00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:49,879
everybody not just one or the other

00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:51,319
group but really all of us coordinate

00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,519
and develop open source libraries and

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,069
tools for the benefit of the overall

00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,649
scala community and of course as I

00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,539
alluded to providing deep quality and

00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:00,259
freely available educational materials

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,129
for Scala

00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:06,679
so two goals open-source community and

00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:07,879
education I'm gonna start by going

00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:09,379
through what I meant what I mean by

00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,529
education real quick before I go into

00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:15,109
the open source side of things but just

00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:18,679
as a quick like show of hands who's

00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:20,869
taken the Scala MOOCs in this room cool

00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:22,309
so that's really like 80% of people did

00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:24,889
they help you like I mean raise your

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:27,559
hand if if you really liked it okay

00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:29,509
actually cool I was I was I'm happy I

00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:31,159
mean you know sometimes you know the

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,629
teaching style isn't the best for

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:34,219
somebody and you know they're not happy

00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:36,199
but it looks like most of the hands

00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:38,240
stayed up so that's really great so so

00:08:36,199 --> 00:08:40,459
far to date we've had over 400,000

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,389
people register for our courses and we

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:43,789
actually have one of the highest

00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:45,740
completion rates across all MOOCs their

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,649
size and this is what I mean I don't

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,139
know if you can see the axes here so the

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,540
x-axis is the number of people enrolled

00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:56,220
in the course for one run of the course

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,949
right so the Scala MOOC was $50

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,300
people or you know about there are

00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:02,160
courses that exist on the planet that

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,160
have up to 200,000 people enrolled in

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,569
them and then the the y-axis here is the

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,819
percentage of people who completed the

00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:10,709
course so as you can see everything sort

00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,810
of like floats down to the bottom left

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:14,879
corner here of course the MOOCs have a

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,879
tendency to be not so big and you know

00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,829
as they get bigger have very very low

00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,740
completion rates in the five or so

00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:24,089
percentage range and where are we on

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,370
that graph we're right here

00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:28,110
we're the highest at the time that this

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,360
graph was created which I checked it

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,889
last night I don't know this is this is

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,720
us we're the highest at the highest

00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:36,389
point for the fifty thousand group we

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,730
have around nineteen point two percent

00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:41,790
of people completed the course that we

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,930
that we first ran in 2012 so we have a

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,879
really high completion rate which is

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,699
really cool so that shows that people

00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,189
are sticking with our courses for

00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:52,350
whatever reason right and and you know

00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:54,449
as I think this the show of hands showed

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,589
is these MOOCs that we've developed they

00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,300
serve as really the main free

00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,759
educational resource for learning Scala

00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,860
it's pretty in-depth and project heavy

00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,180
and example rich and a lot of people

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,910
learn how to sort of program with this

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,769
thing so you know we also might have

00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,269
noticed many of you if you've tried look

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,029
at the MOOCs recently we don't have them

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,680
running anymore they went down several

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,829
months ago and they haven't come back up

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,230
yet so what are we doing we're launching

00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:20,339
new MOOCs but not just the same two that

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,129
we had launched before but we're

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,259
launching more so Coursera has this new

00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:28,529
thing called a specialization so it's

00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:31,259
like a mini degree and we now have four

00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:33,449
courses two of them are new I'm going to

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,879
tell you what's in them in a second and

00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:37,949
we're working on a capstone project to

00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:40,680
finish off that coursework so you have

00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:42,809
this I don't know it actually exactly

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,779
how many months it is it's probably like

00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:48,720
a three month long four month long if

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,180
you you know if you do the X you know

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,329
recommended like miniature degree in

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,490
Scala and and it finishes with this nice

00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:57,899
capstone project right of Coursera

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,779
actually if you guys remember the old

00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,720
Coursera interface it was pretty you

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,309
know wonky sometimes they have a whole

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,829
new platform that's really nice and

00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:09,380
convenient for students I I think it's

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,180
really an amazing improvement

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,860
and the new the new courses that we're

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,150
launching soon are on the men so you

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,040
don't have to do this thing anymore

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,320
where you wait for this twice a year

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,990
seven week-long course there's just like

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,490
two windows for I think we only ever did

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,230
two per year where we have these seven

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,460
week sessions start twice per year you

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,520
don't have to wait for these things to

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,350
start anymore you can now start anytime

00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,210
and keep your own schedule and submit

00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,590
whenever you want you can go away for a

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:37,190
month and come back to it later it's

00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,630
totally on-demand now and so this is a

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,730
you know this is what the the

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:42,140
specialization page looks like when you

00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,930
when you get there I just want to point

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:48,500
out that there are basically two routes

00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:52,070
you can take each individual course for

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,290
free as you did in years past but you

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,170
can also do it verified you get this

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,400
mini degree and you pay some some a

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,860
little bit of money for each course

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,510
basically so that's that's the new thing

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,640
that's what we're we're about ready to

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:06,980
launch and just like before we do our

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,960
automated grading where we you know you

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,960
submit your assignment your your your

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,970
your thing via via SBT and you check

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,560
Coursera is interface and then you get

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,940
this feedback you know for example this

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,190
one's complaining that somebody put

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,290
vowels in their VARs in their code so

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,480
they got docked style points so we

00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,340
checked both correctness and styler

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,720
style but like in this case don't use

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,810
virus otherwise you'll steal points from

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,070
you so we do this automated grading

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,540
thing we're going to do it across all

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,590
four courses we're working out whether

00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,720
or not we can do this in the capstone

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:39,110
project we'll see how that goes but

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,280
these are the courses so I'll talk about

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:42,890
what's in each one of them in a moment

00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,900
but the first two are comprised of

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,980
material that have been in the courses

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,990
that you've seen so far if you've taken

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,280
the courses on Coursera so the first one

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,830
is functional programming principles and

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,540
Scala's that's mostly prog fun or the

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,180
same named course that you might have

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,460
taken in in the last few years there's

00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,380
new there's the next course is called

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,470
functional program design and Scala this

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:05,060
is a made up of a mixture of some

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,920
material out of reactive and some

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,720
material out of this functional

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,980
programming course the old version and

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,410
then we had these two new courses

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,150
parallel programming and big data

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,250
analysis since button scholar and spark

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:19,940
parallel programming is taught by victor

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:22,100
crunch AK and alex proko pets and i'm

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,339
teaching the the big data analysis

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,769
and scholar and spark course so if you

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,779
haven't taken the the MOOC on Coursera

00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,930
the functional programming Panchal

00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:34,040
program MOOC this is really like the

00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,779
quintessential Scala course have you

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,199
ever want to recommend anything to your

00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:40,699
friends really so this is kind of what

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,649
the the course aims to teach you so

00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:44,149
basic principles of functional

00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,750
programming like what is functional what

00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,490
is imperative

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,750
how to write purely functional programs

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,430
using recursion pattern matching

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,260
higher-order functions how to combine

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,579
functional programming with objects and

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,620
classes because of course everything is

00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,329
an object in Scala and then how to

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,370
design immutable data structures and

00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:01,100
reason about properties functions and a

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:04,040
little bit about generic types and the

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,110
type system okay so that course maybe

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,110
you're all familiar with the new one the

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,940
next one which is a mixture of the

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,430
material from the old reactive course in

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,139
prog fun course it's all about applying

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,649
design principles and functional

00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:21,769
programs and combining functions of

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,630
state one program and also I think

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,490
what's most interesting is here writing

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:29,630
simple functional reactive applications

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:32,089
so we have some module on on timely

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,589
effects and futures and whatnot but the

00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:36,620
if you can see here the the course

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,839
begins with four expressions monads goes

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,570
to lazy evaluation functions and state

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,910
and then it ends with this you know nice

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,250
nice little thing on on futures and open

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,899
eric eric meyer is also co-teaching this

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,269
like I said because we've taken some

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,160
material out of the reactive mode so

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,329
that's that's the the to MOOCs that kind

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,579
of we already knew the course material

00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:58,040
new MOOC it's called parallel

00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:59,899
programming so what are we teaching in

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,699
this one if you guys are familiar with

00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,620
any sort of parallelism it's mostly

00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:05,510
tasks I'm sorry it's mostly data

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,630
parallelism but we teach tasks and data

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,399
parallelism so really just to go through

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,490
sort of the main bullet points the

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,019
basics of parallel programming sorry the

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,110
basics of parallel computing and

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:20,810
parallel program analysis basics of sort

00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:24,800
of task parallelism and basic parallel

00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,990
algorithms we go really in depth I think

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,540
into data parallelism in Scala parallel

00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,959
collections you know teaching about how

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,649
to reduce things in you know like well

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,959
like like parallel aggregations

00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:40,329
whatnot and data structures for parallel

00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,149
computing Alex of course is the the the

00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:45,009
the most Scala data structure person I

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,899
know so of course he's going to teach a

00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:49,709
little bit about how to do parallel

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:52,179
computing on data structures and finally

00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:54,399
we have this course called big data

00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,529
analysis with Scala and spark it's a

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,629
three week course so basically the idea

00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,860
is we take the concepts taught in the

00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,259
previous course on data parallelism

00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,119
because probably around I don't know

00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:06,339
60 70 % of that courses about data

00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,749
parallelism and it goes through how

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,480
parallel collections work and how their

00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:11,920
designs and we like extend that to the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,689
distributed case because of course once

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,790
you leave shared memory things change

00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:17,379
concerns change program model changes

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,389
slightly even though it looks kind of

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,449
the same on first glance right so we

00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:23,829
tried to explain how that works we go

00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,660
through the basics of sparks programming

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:28,300
model and we show kind of the

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,619
differences that that happen when you

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,990
when you make this transition from

00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:33,790
shared memory to distributed and then we

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,649
go through how to manipulate data with

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,899
spark and Scala how to express

00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,369
algorithms that you might want to do in

00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,350
sort of a data analysis tasks in a

00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:43,660
functional style and we recognize

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,980
throughout the course how to avoid stuff

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,079
like shuffles which are always you know

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,720
dangerous if you're trying to do

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:54,339
something distributed so when will they

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,290
start may 23rd we hope this is a

00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,360
something that we are working out with

00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,910
Coursera they've given us this state's I

00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,759
hope it sticks we've been trying to

00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,470
launch all month this month but we

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,329
believe that this is the final date so

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,669
mark your calendars the first three

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,100
courses are planned to start on May 23rd

00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:13,539
and if you'd like to if you'd like if

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,829
you're interested in any of them and you

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,319
want to stay up to date I would

00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:19,299
recommend that you visit the Scala

00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,949
Center webpage and leave your name and

00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,919
email address and we will update you

00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,199
with an email when we know exactly when

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,940
things are starting it cetera we will we

00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:32,890
will hit that email address but yeah ok

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,840
so now open source because I think this

00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:40,360
is you know what most people in this

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,710
room care about right so we think that

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,080
much can be improved in the open source

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,210
side of scala so the scales under seeks

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,980
to not only

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,200
improve sort of the landscape of the

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,270
libraries around Scala and like I said

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,830
I'll go through that momentarily but

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,390
we'd also really like to sort of

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,220
substantially grow the community that we

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,440
have of open source contributors not to

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,690
just Scala but to libraries in the

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
ecosystem in general right so Scala

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,320
libraries out there we think that it's

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,940
important to also try and coordinate and

00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,919
direct sort of open source development

00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,010
of libraries and tools for the broad

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,289
benefit of everybody and as I show you

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,750
in a second we're trying to find ways to

00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,970
provide scaffolding to help people find

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,279
each other help the community develop

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:24,970
publish find and evaluate Scala

00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,140
libraries so I think I think one point

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,669
that I'd really like to highlight is

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,440
that well we'd like to contribute

00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,320
libraries and tools ourselves we really

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,020
also like as a main as a main big goal

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,549
is to provide sort of scaffolding

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,559
infrastructure and guidance to sort of

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,510
the community as a whole so that other

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,940
for the good of all projects can strive

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,730
as well so we want to provide all kinds

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,340
of you know mostly mostly structure in

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,590
an infrastructure where we can so that

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,620
other projects can grow and people can

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,429
can benefit from them all we have a

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,320
philosophy at least I have a little

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:58,570
philosophy that I'm trying to to realize

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,520
here to achieve this this idea of there

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,950
being sort of infrastructure and

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,929
structure that people can sort of join

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,760
and figure out how to you know hit their

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:09,130
library to grow and get contributors to

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,320
it so I have some proposals about how we

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,480
how we should first try to achieve this

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,510
so I what I've been really trying to do

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,890
with the first one or two projects that

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,720
we've kind of been working on in the

00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,860
scylla Center is to try and grow like a

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,940
little bit a little community of

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:26,590
contributors around it so again I'll go

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,940
through a couple of the examples of the

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,549
of the initiatives that we're going to

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,710
we're working on in a second but for

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,600
example what we'd like to provide to

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:37,770
these sort of initiatives that we're

00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,399
trying to push is for example hardware

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,049
infrastructure we want to make sure that

00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:42,340
that's available for a project so that

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,100
there's a machine that something can run

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,679
on right we want to help projects be

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,970
organized and and be broken down into

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,370
pieces so that other people can help

00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,899
with them so other people just who would

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,520
wish to contribute in the community can

00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:57,789
could come and take a piece and start

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,420
trying to participate and and for some

00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:02,200
of these projects that you know like

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:05,960
that we really want to see existed

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,360
exists we want well well you know put

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,190
one or two Scala Center staff members -

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,600
on it - it you know engage and

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,310
participate through the development so

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,470
the whole point is that we want to build

00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,970
teams with people in the community and

00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,950
give contributors that are on these

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,960
projects some control and the ability to

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,520
contribute and change and sort of shape

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,110
the vision of some of these things so

00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,820
we'd like to try and help sort of in

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:31,760
that sense you know organize projects so

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,760
since since we want to maximize sort of

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,530
the benefit people's efforts we want to

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,150
like work together to grow something

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,280
that we can all sort of depend on in

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,530
particular this process so just to

00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,790
reiterate we want like for some of the

00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,800
projects that I'm going to present to

00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,950
you we're trying to grow a little team

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,200
of core contributors and committers so

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,270
that you know consisting of scale center

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,330
staffs and folks from also the community

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:57,860
not just us for the first two projects

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,350
I'm going to cover we started doing this

00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,760
by you know having little 30-minute

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,320
weekly project meetings around other

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,420
other people's schedules to keep it

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,490
concise and figure out what next next

00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,900
steps are planned each member's goals

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,850
and whatnot and to sync on each other's

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,470
availabilities and activities we also

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,780
have dedicated slack channels to these

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,460
projects so it's it's it's nice for

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,590
being able to always sort of ping the

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,120
group ask questions to broadcast sort of

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,330
daily like hey yeah this thing works

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,530
finally and you know helping preventing

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,150
people from hopefully getting stuck and

00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:29,270
then you know sharing some jokes

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,520
sometimes so this is what we're this is

00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,410
kind of the structure that I'm trying to

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,070
see if it works it's an experiment right

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,330
now but that's kind of the the

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,970
philosophy for some of these open-source

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,890
projects but you might ask okay well

00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,660
wait how does this work then how do you

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,550
have staff members that should be able

00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,010
to spend time on things like this where

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:51,230
does that money come from so maybe I

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:54,560
should take a quick aside say and try to

00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,180
cover the sort of overall structure

00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,620
structure of our organization what kind

00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,180
of organization are we it's a good

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,220
question all I told you so far is that

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,660
we're not-for-profit not put some pretty

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,150
hard constraints on us on what we can do

00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,060
and how much others can influence us so

00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,190
real quick as a quick sort of rundown of

00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,230
how we exist in the first place

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,330
EPA fell very graciously provided

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,190
some seed funding so we could you know

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,590
hire the first two people and beyond

00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,470
those two people were funded directly

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,660
from from from donations by companies so

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,160
when you see you know somebody is an

00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,470
imaginary board member or some kind of

00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,570
industrial affiliate this is you know

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,090
them donating to this vision of having

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,760
some courts sort of steward to Scala and

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,380
actually the the I underlined donations

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,450
because this this this little bit is

00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,520
crucial it means that by becoming a

00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,230
corporate member and contributing to the

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,780
Scala center companies you know Kent's

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:49,290
its donations its charitable donations

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,760
companies you know can't invoke Scala

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,280
Center staff to implement things for

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,710
them for example the idea is that the

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,380
the Scala center needs to as a member of

00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:00,030
a university and as a not-for-profit it

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,880
has to always remain independent it

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,590
can't be a contracting vessel so every

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,930
transaction is actually at but like

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:08,190
really scrutinized by the university to

00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,110
ensure that it's it's a charitable

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,600
donation which means that all membership

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,210
documents and and everything is checked

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,800
by EPFL finance department before the

00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,530
university will even agree to Reese

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,290
receiving any sort of money so really

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,840
money that comes in it has to it has to

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,790
be effectively a charitable donation and

00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,520
I like this wording this kind of says it

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,440
then the nicest this is in one of our

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,210
membership documents basically it says

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,190
the Scala Center has been created as an

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,190
independent nonprofit organization

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,780
within EPFL our independence from

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,160
commercial interests is protected by the

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,840
statute for the Swiss Federal

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,280
restriction that our funding must be

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,990
made as charitable donations for us to

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,460
retrieve receive contributions and their

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,760
entirety not linked to any particular

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,020
initiative this ensures objectivity in

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,340
an accountability for our

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,710
decision-making and allows us to focus

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,630
on our overall mission which I said is a

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,440
benefit of everybody and not you know

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:04,710
one company's bottom line I think that's

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,540
really important to remember so you know

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,340
that said well what a what a corporate

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,110
members get for their donations well

00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,790
they get their the right to stay in the

00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,710
loop on everything that we're doing

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,820
they guarantee of some kind of progress

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,810
for us we're going to do something for

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,650
the community we're going to show you

00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,240
that we're doing something for the

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,620
community and the ability to make

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,950
recommendations about what they think is

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,210
important and and for us to even listen

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,290
to the recommendation it has to be

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,730
something for the good of everybody it

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,700
can't be

00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,590
implement this thing for us right so

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,900
this is sort of the structure so there's

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,980
an advisory board right I alluded to

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,540
there being an advisory board because

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:37,430
there are companies that that fund us

00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,350
well how does that work the advisory

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,730
board is made up of representatives from

00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:44,060
the Scala center community

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,940
representative or representatives we'll

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:47,810
talk about that later and

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,390
representatives from these these these

00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:52,760
organizations that are funding us the

00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,280
community and corporate representatives

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,010
they vote on what they think is

00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,570
something we should spend our time on so

00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:01,190
when we meet in these when we have these

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,410
meetings we discuss sort of what the

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,820
Scala Center has been doing what

00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,560
progress it's been making on its and

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,470
initiatives and we discuss areas of

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,640
concern that might need attention so

00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,530
it's fine for a company to be like hey

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,660
guys the documentation on this this

00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,070
thing is really bad and all of my

00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,390
developers need it we've had to write

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,440
in-house documentation will be really

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,730
great if there was something publicly

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,010
available for everybody can we

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,650
centralize this or something for example

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,700
right and everybody talks about it and

00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:27,680
like yeah that's that's good for

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,210
everybody definitely this is something

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,450
that we should consider doing and these

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,340
are these are recommendations again in

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,590
order for this to be something that the

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:39,790
university will accept and for us to be

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:42,320
a not-for-profit we have to be able to

00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:44,390
decide which of these we can act on if

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,250
we act on any of them basically so we

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:47,480
have to remain independent but yet at

00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,560
the same time we are committed to being

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,390
completely transparent

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560
in fact we post all documents related to

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,790
the advisory board meetings and a github

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,820
repository which you can look at right

00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,650
now we don't have minutes up yet we had

00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,820
a meeting yesterday afternoon right

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,140
before Martin's keynote

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,790
there'll be meetings in the next few

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,230
days but if you'd like to read more

00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,910
about how this process should take place

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,600
you can see our agendas minutes

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:10,910
proposals that that advisory members are

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,830
like hey we think this is important and

00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,480
you know everything else related to

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,700
these meetings here there's nothing

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,940
nothing being withheld everything is in

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,770
the open and just the sort of summarized

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,780
yesterday like I said we had our first

00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,080
meeting to show to show you what people

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:30,020
are suggesting I think that you'll so

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,670
there was one other minor point that you

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,470
know was adding a position it's like a

00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,030
made-up point otherwise these are the

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,770
main initiatives that we discussed

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,000
yesterday and I think one that everybody

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,900
will agree with is

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,550
you know this idea that we should

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,100
improve the governance of community

00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,780
processes so sips slips like this should

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,720
be much better than it currently is it

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,010
should be revitalized so this is one of

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,980
the initiatives put forth by the

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:54,470
advisory board yesterday another is you

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,720
know clarifying the the Scala to doggie

00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,580
migration path maybe somebody wants to

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,860
adopt dotty eventually we should figure

00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,020
out how how somebody who was using Scala

00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,180
to tedx can get there perhaps the Scala

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,980
center should care about migration tools

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,890
to try and help that that transition

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,500
happened and there are many people who

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,090
are now depending on Scala yes so one

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,590
suggestion was well we should try to

00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,300
make sure that Scala jeaious doesn't

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:19,550
doesn't die because of some funding

00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,050
burke for example so these are the sorts

00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,180
of things that we're discussing and I

00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:28,100
hope you agree that these are generally

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:29,740
interesting for everybody and so wait

00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,100
what about light Ben you might ask oh

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,840
that's good

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,960
everything is fine we work together

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,730
orthogonal II so as you might have

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,160
guessed light Ben will still maintain

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,950
the stable Scala release instead of

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,470
jumping on that train and you know we're

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:47,360
going to start with libraries and a

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,180
Scylla East ecosystem and other things

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,620
that we're looking at taking care of or

00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,270
focusing some effort on our other

00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,280
orthogonal areas of interest like Dottie

00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:56,990
or any of the alternative backends so

00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,250
scale GS or perhaps scale native one day

00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,380
when it sort of matures a little bit

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,840
right so this is sort of how we position

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,920
ourselves and we hope to work together

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:13,130
with the the compiler team at light Bend

00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:15,320
okay nitty-gritty details over I think I

00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,730
would like to now talk to you about some

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,760
of the projects that we're working on

00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:22,790
this is more exciting I think so I have

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,470
a question for people what do node

00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:29,750
Haskell and rust have in common that

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:31,430
scarlet doesn't well yes somebody says

00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,720
well I think I think everybody knows

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,900
that that we're going to do this anyway

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,700
this isn't a secret so the secret is a

00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,600
package index or manager or something

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,690
something about packages right we think

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,950
we believe very much that if you develop

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,750
an open-source library and you publish

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,640
it to maven or something else you

00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,320
shouldn't have to be a good salesman to

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,870
get your library used by people if it

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,910
does it

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,010
well it should just be used by people

00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:59,040
you shouldn't have to be really popular

00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,900
kid to make it make people use it and

00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,070
unfortunately you have to be right now

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,200
because there's no way to find Scylla

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,430
libraries you can just search around on

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,640
github but that doesn't mean you think

00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:09,720
it's published there right so we think

00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,610
it's a really good idea to put together

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,010
a package index we should make it a lot

00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,390
easier for users to find libraries and

00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,010
that's my idea of what it looks like

00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,809
when you sell things so you shouldn't

00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,620
have to look like that guy I mean at

00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:21,780
least you shouldn't have to wear a

00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,880
cowboy hat so we want to give a voice to

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:25,920
these great projects that exist and that

00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,020
are out there that are bug free and

00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,370
great and they're just not being

00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,480
publicized right

00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:34,400
I mean people should be able to find

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,780
these things and use them so introducing

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,870
this thing that we're right now calling

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,220
Scala decks at the moment it's the ideas

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,670
that it would be a packaged index for

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:48,780
Scala so we'd actually we've actually

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:50,700
already built this mostly it's a so we

00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,950
want to basically have a map of the

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,660
known Scylla ecosystem right now what

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,250
what libraries are out there what what

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,960
what versions of Scala can I compile it

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,300
with what dependencies do these things

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,130
have so the idea is that it's based off

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,320
of libraries that are published and by

00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:07,320
published of course we mean to maven so

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,600
maybe it's a sauna type or bin tray and

00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,610
we we generate this index from from info

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,990
grabbed from pom files grabbed off of

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,230
github and eventually from other places

00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,700
like Stack Overflow as well and and we

00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,110
also want to make it possible for you

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,230
know this isn't an auto magical tool

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:27,809
completely by itself people who own

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,760
these libraries or packages should be

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,860
able to update the configuration info

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,870
about them to add you know also we have

00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,730
this you can't really see it but you

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,040
know community badges for linking these

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,830
things from github back to the packaged

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,059
index stuff like this so career the

00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,460
current status of this thing is that

00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:46,740
we've crawled maven and collected all

00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,360
the known Scala libraries that exist so

00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,040
if you publish something embarrassing we

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,870
might have collected it and indexed it

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,280
so just a heads up okay so we've done

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,570
this we had this data set it was really

00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,370
difficult to do all this to get all of

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,929
this data clean it up and and and and

00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,010
sort of generate some interesting things

00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:05,070
from it

00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,510
so we've got that it exists and neck the

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:08,940
next steps are really to put a nice UI

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,390
on it and to try and figure out ways to

00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:14,610
show more meaningful bits of information

00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,919
and I'd like to you know I'm not the one

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,150
building this there are actually two of

00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,580
the guys we're building it here and

00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,290
since since you know they're here I'm

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,520
not going to steal the Thunder by by

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:25,350
doubling what they've been working hard

00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,660
to build my main contribution to this

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,460
index was more backseat driving than

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,679
anything so I'd like to call them up

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,270
real quick to show you a little demo of

00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,299
what they have so far so like I said

00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:39,299
this is without the you know like super

00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,350
shiny sparkly interface but it should it

00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:42,210
already shows you some really

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,910
interesting information and I hope that

00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,950
you guys you like it so maybe you um

00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,540
masae and John pretty you can come up

00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:51,390
and talk real quick about the current

00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:55,679
status of this thing I'm gilma say I'm a

00:31:51,390 --> 00:32:01,020
janitor at this at the Scylla center I

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:04,890
am taking care of all those library out

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:08,190
there in the in the wall and when I was

00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:09,990
a kid I always thought that the janitor

00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:13,679
is it's the coolest job out there

00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:19,080
because they have a really big key chain

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:21,540
and they have access to all the rooms so

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:26,549
what I'm doing now it's unleashing

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:32,370
what's out there in on maven central ok

00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:34,620
so then let me show you some demo all

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:38,280
right so the first thing you can search

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:42,320
for no libraries for example if I'm

00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,320
looking for it at type level cats

00:32:50,220 --> 00:33:03,460
all right so you got a list of libraries

00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:06,070
and this is a project page um a nice

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,060
feature is that you can you can have the

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:14,590
install string for SBT and we have the

00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:19,570
latest scala duck every label so this is

00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:30,400
a cat GBM but you also have Cat Cat

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:32,200
score so one thing that is also pretty

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,480
nice is that you have the reverse

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,600
dependencies this means that you can

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,240
find all the published project that

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:47,920
depends on on your on your library for

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:51,540
example for example in the akka HTTP

00:33:47,920 --> 00:34:03,520
project we can find on a torrent

00:33:51,540 --> 00:34:08,230
application right here and it's get up

00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:12,520
your poster and this is actually pretty

00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:16,390
nice it's it has a it has a front end

00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:22,630
with s ecology as video that you can see

00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:25,390
that the tauren is streaming and this

00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,220
guy is is based in North Korea so I

00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:32,110
guess he doesn't have an ethic account

00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:35,860
or something so it's really cool to find

00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:37,810
like no libraries but also to find some

00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,080
hidden gems like this for example

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:43,590
all right I'll pass it to John and to

00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,230
tell us how it works

00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:50,880
Thanks thanks again hi everyone I'm John

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:55,030
pretty and with with Heather Guillaume

00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,490
Salah and Horace over the last few weeks

00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,240
we've been working on on on building

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:04,740
this that's index

00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:08,130
it it was a bit of a challenge our core

00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:11,310
data was coming from maven from pom

00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:14,460
files now who here has looked at a pom

00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:16,470
file at some points so mote like I think

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:21,930
almost every hand has gone up that there

00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:24,330
in XML that the data is the data is not

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,580
necessarily clean it generally links or

00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:30,230
is intended to link to some sort of

00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:33,930
version control like a git repository or

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:36,390
subversion potentially but there's

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,010
there's no that no one's enforcing those

00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,890
links are are correct

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:44,520
so we first of all had to grab all that

00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,890
data we tried to get it from from maven

00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,240
central and we got rate limited and we

00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:51,000
checked the terms of the license and

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,670
we're not allowed to do that so we that

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,830
was a non-starter so we we spoke to the

00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:59,400
bin tere bin trailer very helpful they

00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:02,490
they gave us special different

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,340
dispensation to to download all the data

00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,510
from them and and use it they they they

00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,180
they're very much supporting what we're

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,220
doing they actually even provided

00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,220
additional API is to make some of the

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,100
tasks we we do easier so I've been been

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,470
to have been extremely helpful but even

00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,870
having got all those poms we had to we

00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:24,210
had to make sense of the data we had and

00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,490
try and understand them we we did a

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,410
little hack to try and judge what's the

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:29,940
scala project and what's what's not a

00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,610
scholar project by by seeing if the

00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:35,100
project name ends in underscore 2.10 or

00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:37,290
2.11 that that turned out to be a

00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,880
reasonable heuristic for for guessing

00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:44,100
whether something is scholar or or Java

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,920
and then we had to try and try and link

00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,330
these back to to github and try and try

00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,920
and associate the data that was from the

00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,050
pom files with the the source

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,510
repositories and it's not a one it's not

00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:56,820
a one-to-one mapping different versions

00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,890
link back to different potentially

00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,710
different git repositories the data's

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:04,380
are met and Yom spend a huge huge length

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,610
of time trying to make sense of it try

00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,080
to find out what the conventions were

00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:12,660
that people were using to to to organize

00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:14,260
organize their date and organize their

00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,960
projects

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:21,220
so we've made a we've made a first stab

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:24,310
at it and let later on you'll be able to

00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:26,829
see you can check your own projects and

00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:31,359
see how we've done in interpreting that

00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:33,880
but it's a it's not a not a perfect art

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,839
so this will be something which will

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,050
improve over time as we as we sort of

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:43,359
analyze how well we've done so far at

00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:45,820
creating these links what we would like

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,400
to do in the future is is it's add more

00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:52,420
links and enable you as as project

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,400
owners and developers to to correct data

00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,910
where it's where it's where it's

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,980
incorrect

00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:58,960
pomme files of course immutable once

00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,099
they're published you can't change them

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,380
they're out there forever all those

00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:04,420
embarrassing projects that Heather

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Heather mentioned you might have you

00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,140
can't get rid of them

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:10,119
so one thing we might like to provide is

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:14,710
to give you the opportunity to fix fix

00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,660
links to your git repositories or even

00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,790
to mark your your own project as

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:21,250
deprecated your own binaries as being

00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:26,290
deprecated to put a label saying don't

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:29,380
use this so these are all things you

00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:32,500
might like to do add it and embellish

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,470
the the data with links to Stack

00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:38,290
Overflow tags so some projects are

00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:40,569
widely used to the point where Stack

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:42,490
Overflow has tags devoted there's no

00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:45,640
there's no link to those tags from the

00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,140
data that's out there at the moment so

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,829
this is something you'll be able to

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:53,380
you'll be able to add later links to key

00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,960
words so we can associate projects as

00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,720
being for example involved with parsing

00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:03,790
or XML or chasing the JSON tag might

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:06,849
have quite a lot of libraries in it we

00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:08,950
would like to develop it further to to

00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:11,650
provide additional ways of accessing the

00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:13,690
data Guillaume showed you an early an

00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,150
early iteration of the the front end

00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,040
user interface will do more work over

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:21,670
the next few weeks on improving this and

00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:25,060
and having a beautiful beautifully

00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:27,190
designed interface that that will

00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:29,349
hopefully be ready bye-bye Scala days in

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,410
in Berlin so that's over a month away

00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:34,839
but additionally there might be useful

00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:36,970
things you can do with a REST API or

00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,579
from a command line so we'd like to

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,589
explore for example providing a neat

00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:43,210
command-line utility for for example

00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:44,950
just finding out what the latest version

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,800
of a project is getting its reverse

00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:53,349
dependencies searching on keywords or by

00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:55,960
name so that's that's some vague idea of

00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:59,140
the the plans we have but we're

00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,810
interested in ideas when when we get to

00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,339
Scala days we will we will hopefully

00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:06,880
holidays at berlin's I say the next one

00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:08,740
we will hopefully be in a state where we

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,869
can we can release it both as a as a

00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,530
service for you to access and explore

00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:16,770
but also to release the source code and

00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:19,210
we are very keen to get contributions

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,640
now those those can take two forms one

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,829
you contribute code you can you can

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,200
develop features and then create a pull

00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:28,210
request but we'd also like to engage

00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:31,359
with people and find out what you would

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,130
find useful we'd like to hear if if you

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,930
start using the index and find that

00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,609
actually we've we've done something

00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,109
wrong with the way your project is

00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:40,950
indexed or another project has indexed

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:45,369
the way we've we've grouped versions or

00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:47,710
details like this and I'm sure there

00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:49,690
will be cut because of the sort of

00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,520
relatively low quality of the data we've

00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,619
started with I'm sure that we lots of

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,430
work for us to do in in improving that

00:40:53,619 --> 00:41:01,990
going forwards so just just just to sum

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:06,310
up the the project is probably about

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:09,790
halfway through we we will have had the

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:13,569
release ready we hope for about a month

00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,680
time and it's an open source project we

00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:18,400
would we would love to get people

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,560
involved and I I welcome everybody here

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,650
to join in to engage in the conversation

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,470
and suggest ideas everything is

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:29,440
everything is possible so we look

00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:29,800
forward to to hearing those ideas thanks

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,660
guys

00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,500
so I'm happy that they were here and

00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,750
they could show it to you and that I

00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,460
wasn't the one being like look at this

00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,890
I did this because I didn't write this

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,240
was them so and also there are other

00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:43,330
people who are just contributing their

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:47,110
time so something so Joris is a student

00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:49,720
salar is working in washington DC i

00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:51,850
believe they're just contributing their

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,860
time and ideas and helping us with

00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:56,320
things like you know integrating scala

00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:57,910
j/s and react code or whatever they've

00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,920
they've been contributing a lot of

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,310
effort to this so this has been very

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,280
cool a very cool start so far i think

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:07,780
thank you guys and as as they mentioned

00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,410
we're hoping for the release to be scala

00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:13,300
days berlin and i mean John has already

00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,950
sort of alluded to some cool things that

00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,830
could could happen if there's an API

00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:22,150
available you could imagine that there

00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:22,480
would be a way for well this point down

00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,120
here

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,040
Adrian Moore's and I've already chatted

00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,050
about this potential possibility you

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,500
know it could be possible for the like

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,380
mint

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,780
team to upgrade the the community bill

00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,030
to an ecosystem builds that the the new

00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,500
releases of Scala could be run against

00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,330
lots of libraries and we could catch

00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,850
issues without you guys having to ever

00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:45,880
do with it that's really cool other

00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:47,770
ideas you know generate being able to

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,300
when you're generating documentation

00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,740
make some API requests and figure out

00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,420
exactly how to link your documentation

00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,770
to things that exist on the Internet if

00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,080
it's not going to be fully static and in

00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,250
some directory somewhere right we can

00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,720
also make all kinds of other stuff

00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:00,190
available that mean these are all just

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,270
ideas that we're realizing that we can

00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,580
now do that we since we have this

00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:05,710
information available to us we have

00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,900
artifacts and we have source code we can

00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,280
imagine finding a way to parse and

00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,990
display important stuff that we get out

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,060
of build files like for example we can

00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:14,740
put somewhere that hey this library by

00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,930
the way this library is like using

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,670
experimental stuff just a heads up if

00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,320
your company is kind of scared of that

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,150
stuff maybe you shouldn't use this

00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,710
library we can put all kinds of things

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,450
that we can get out of build files

00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,640
potentially since we can you know get

00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,810
back into the source code we could you

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,690
know the sky is limited with this sort

00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:34,210
of stuff and and yeah as I mentioned or

00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,830
as Guillaume showed you can show like

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,540
dependents you can show how popular

00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,620
something is based on all the libraries

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,810
that are published that depend on it

00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:43,000
right so I think this is a cool projects

00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,800
tonight I hope it it keeps on going the

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,450
way it is I'm really excited about it

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,650
that's one thing that we've been

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:49,240
investing our time in a

00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:50,890
side of the mooks but there are a lot of

00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,410
other initiatives on the radar that I

00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,030
think will well matter to people so I

00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,860
think that we're going to be the ones

00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:59,530
ultimately charged with this task of

00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:01,450
separating out the Scala standard

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,280
library into this notion of Scala core

00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:05,200
and Scala platform I'm not going to talk

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,570
a whole lot about that because Martin Rd

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,190
mentioned it yesterday but the idea is

00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,660
that you know the compiler has

00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,140
stabilized and we're really happy about

00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:13,000
that

00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,920
but our libraries have also kind of

00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,450
frozen along with it and maybe they

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,610
don't have to we'd like to maybe open up

00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:22,420
these libraries to people you know

00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:24,460
outside of sort of the the like stable

00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:27,160
compiler group there should be maybe a

00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:28,600
way to define what is corn what is

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,610
platform and separate these things into

00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,670
those spaces and also maybe you know

00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:35,320
must have libraries that you know 90% of

00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,000
projects use maybe we should consider

00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,100
including this in this platform thing

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,920
even if we didn't develop it at EPFL

00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,020
ourselves right so this is the idea this

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,760
is currently a proposal and discussion

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,440
we're not going to go and do this

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,760
without consulting with people this is

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,350
probably an initiative that we're going

00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,180
to take up in the nearest future another

00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:59,340
project that we were just trying to get

00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:01,450
started on do you guys know jsfiddle

00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,650
have you guys learned JavaScript with

00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,690
that because that's how I figured out

00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:06,100
how JavaScript worked really like every

00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,780
time I was confused by some crazy thing

00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,160
that it did some guy was like no no it's

00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,160
because and then you know I got I got a

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,510
link to a job a JSP and this is rampant

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,640
on Stack Overflow this is how you learn

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,200
JavaScript right I wouldn't it be really

00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,470
cool if people could program in Scala

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,780
that way and hopefully soon you can so

00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:25,480
this is a this is a project that we're

00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,950
hoping to try and and and take up and

00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,040
invest a little bit more effort in soon

00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:31,810
but it's sort of the same idea how do

00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:33,700
you how do you run a little Scala

00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,770
snippets in your browser you could maybe

00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,420
even think about potentially using this

00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,550
as like an in-browser repple and Scala

00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:42,340
Lang we could you know do the same thing

00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,170
that people do with jsfiddle on mailing

00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,940
lists and Stack Overflow where you link

00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,410
to these things oh yeah I know how to do

00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,690
that let me show you here's a link right

00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:51,370
and and maybe we can even have much

00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,100
cooler documentation or we embed these

00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:55,480
fiddles and the documentation of

00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:57,910
libraries so that people can experiment

00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,200
with something right so this is this is

00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,029
the idea we'd like to take something up

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,189
like this very soon we've already

00:46:01,029 --> 00:46:04,749
sort of started a little bit so the

00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:10,539
author of this project is Otto Crohn's

00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:13,419
he I think forked lead Howie's Scala

00:46:10,539 --> 00:46:15,669
jsfiddle and tried to make this thing

00:46:13,419 --> 00:46:18,249
that he called Scala fiddle more

00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:19,539
embeddable in different places and you

00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:21,099
can you know like use it in

00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:23,859
documentation and whatnot

00:46:21,099 --> 00:46:26,559
and there's a guy named Jason Calvert

00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:28,209
who has been helping out with some of

00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,529
the design and the ideas a little bit

00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:31,419
but again we're trying to grow a little

00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:32,319
team around this and see if we can sort

00:46:31,419 --> 00:46:33,880
of do the same thing that we've been

00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,249
doing with the Scala index with the

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,439
Scala fiddle project I know there is

00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:40,989
another project that we're going to very

00:46:38,439 --> 00:46:43,599
soon be taking up as its alluded to

00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:44,799
earlier on when I kind of summarized

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,119
what happened in this advisory board

00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:48,669
meeting since we're just getting started

00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:51,009
there's a lot for us to do still but

00:46:48,669 --> 00:46:53,349
we're hoping to pick up what we plan to

00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:55,179
pick up the sip slip process starting

00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:56,829
next month and to try and revamp it a

00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:58,179
little bit to rebuild excitements and

00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:00,130
make this process actually work again

00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:01,359
like I said since this is since we're

00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,459
just getting started and this is really

00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,759
early I don't have a lot of you know

00:47:03,459 --> 00:47:08,979
like concrete answers to how we're going

00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:12,429
to do that but you know more soon on

00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:15,640
that on that front and and finally I

00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:18,009
just want to point out you know you can

00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,929
always be a part of what we're doing in

00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:21,489
some in some way so there are a number

00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:23,409
of companies individuals who've

00:47:21,489 --> 00:47:24,999
contributed funds you actually so these

00:47:23,409 --> 00:47:26,890
these these are our advisory board

00:47:24,999 --> 00:47:29,380
members by the way the companies listed

00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,809
up top right they're the ones that you

00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,189
know really believe in this idea of

00:47:30,809 --> 00:47:36,219
contributing to the overall sort of

00:47:33,189 --> 00:47:37,779
scala community and ecosystem but you

00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:38,949
know if you're a scholar shop you don't

00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:41,229
have to give us money actually what's

00:47:38,949 --> 00:47:43,390
more valuable our pull requests ideas

00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:45,880
getting involved in a project that's

00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:47,529
more valuable than cash in my opinion so

00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,449
beyond the warm and fuzzy feeling that

00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:50,919
it gets you to contribute back to this

00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:52,719
language ecosystem that you use every

00:47:50,919 --> 00:47:55,479
day you get a lot from it you know not

00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,739
only did you fix it back in like the the

00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:58,029
fix that you contributed get back in

00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:01,029
like cycle back into what you're doing

00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:03,729
most likely getting involved in open

00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:05,169
source gives visibility and could really

00:48:03,729 --> 00:48:07,150
help with things like hiring if you're

00:48:05,169 --> 00:48:08,499
looking to hire new developers ever at

00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,729
some point it's really cool to be

00:48:08,499 --> 00:48:10,929
involved in open source of thats case

00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:13,329
people are really interested in that

00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:14,950
sort of company i've noticed right so

00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:16,780
you know if you're a scholar

00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,730
for scholar freelancer consider

00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,160
investing by contributing back in some

00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:23,290
way whether that be you know publishing

00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:25,540
your own library or contributing back to

00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:27,130
actual scholar and standard library or

00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,440
contributing to somebody else's library

00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:31,089
you know get involved that's what we

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,920
would really like to see happen so if

00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:34,900
you're a company and you want to ever

00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:36,099
contribute back you know one cool idea

00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,210
is to allow your developers to spend a

00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:41,099
little bit of time getting back to some

00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,099
some project in this ecosystem

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,380
and and I'm gonna wind down now but as

00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,940
John you know mentioned I would really

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,609
like to encourage people to get in touch

00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:54,310
and to talk to us we're we're here for

00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:56,619
you guys right so at the moment we have

00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:58,060
this Gator channel which you can always

00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:59,800
visit and it's kind of like at the

00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,660
moment of a water cooler or a place

00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,640
where people sort of you know oh yeah

00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,349
this happened and you know the the

00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,210
course might be delayed etc we're giving

00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:08,800
updates on things and and people who are

00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,970
popping into this and then getting

00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,020
involved in one of our projects

00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:12,490
basically so if you'd like to get

00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,050
involved in one of the projects that's a

00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,670
it's a good entry point to it you can

00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:18,880
also you know is that this this email

00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:21,160
address and Bill Boehner's actually is

00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,810
the the community representative at the

00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,869
moment on the on the advisory board and

00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,250
you know as as such he he told me he'd

00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:28,960
really like to collect feedback from

00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,430
people so if you ever want to complain

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,990
about something how it doesn't work and

00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:34,210
how it should be fixed in some way by

00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:36,460
that Scala Center he said he's very

00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:38,829
graciously you know offered to be the

00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,849
guy you can come and talk to about these

00:49:38,829 --> 00:49:41,200
things so you can always get in contact

00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:43,930
with him as well if you prefer to talk

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,790
to him directly and of course if you if

00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:47,950
you forget his name he's the guy at the

00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:50,230
Artemis stand who is sort of the main

00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,780
publisher behind the the programming in

00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:54,760
Scala book so you remember who he is but

00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,800
that's about all I have for you thank

00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,300
you I'm happy to answer any questions

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,359
that you guys may have about you know

00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:06,460
anything Scala center or in general so

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:09,579
thanks okay so just Ryan summarize

00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,349
question basically the the question was

00:50:09,579 --> 00:50:13,569
well first we observe that the Scala

00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:15,099
ecotoxicology system that's developing

00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:16,750
at Scala in general Scala is very uh

00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:18,069
opinionated language there's a wide

00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,109
variety of styles one could choose to

00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:22,630
use and as a result you have like this

00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:24,369
divergence of sort of accepted styles

00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:26,950
and disagreements and whatnot and you

00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:28,330
you ask a Czerny plan from the Scala

00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:31,180
center to try and

00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:32,740
guide people towards some way of doing

00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:35,320
things so there's less maybe friction at

00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,220
some point is that a good summary that's

00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:39,820
a really good point

00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:42,070
and unfortunately we don't have any sort

00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:43,990
of active initiative or project or

00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,910
anything to do that that's not to say

00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:46,990
that we'll never do anything that's to

00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,730
say that maybe we should start a

00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:50,800
conversation about something like this

00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:52,900
I'm not sure exactly the best way to do

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,580
it right because this isn't like a sip

00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,200
for a slip or one of these proposals to

00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:58,030
the language this is like a process

00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,620
suggestion so it's almost like we need a

00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,740
process for a process suggestion I know

00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,540
it sounds crazy but I you are not the

00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:07,300
only person of course I mean I'm sure

00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:08,980
you know we've all gone gone around to

00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,270
different companies and have seen sort

00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,830
of the ridiculous diversions and how

00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:13,630
people do things and sort of best

00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:15,730
practices at individual companies and I

00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:17,470
unfortunately have no answer for that

00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,940
other than yes it is really important

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,740
everybody cares about it and we should

00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:22,060
do something about it but exactly what

00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,860
we have to sort of maybe work out

00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,120
together as a community and we're open

00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,490
we're open to doing something about it

00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,040
exactly what I'm not I don't have the

00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:31,870
authority to say that's for everybody so

00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,730
yes I hope so I hope we can do something

00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:37,840
about it at some point I hope I wish

00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:40,060
that was a more concrete answer so this

00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,370
is basically ready to launch we're

00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,860
waiting we're waiting basically a two

00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:47,110
and a half three weeks for it to go live

00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,250
mostly because Coursera is testing and

00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,920
double-checking that everything looks

00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:53,140
good before they make it public but it's

00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,630
it's about ready to be released and if

00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,670
you'd like to you know a reminder about

00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,040
when it is released I would go to that

00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,690
the Scylla Center webpage and and and

00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,950
sign up and put your name on the mailing

00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:05,320
list because we'll send out an email to

00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,130
let you know when it is live finally if

00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,290
you're interested in that is that the

00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,670
question that you had reactive extension

00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:11,590
no there's no reactive extensions it's

00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,390
basically just like monads and futures

00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,720
and things right now

00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:19,150
so nothing nothing major top no no major

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,980
topics that I didn't list on that slide

00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,720
it's not that we don't ever plan on

00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,190
having that material again it's just

00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,690
that we don't have a clear plan for

00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:27,160
integrating it into our current course

00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,840
material that doesn't mean it's not

00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,390
going to come back who are the companies

00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,580
yeah so back on this slide these are

00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,920
these are the companies so they want all

00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,540
the logos on the top of the slide I mean

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,460
except I mean EPFL we can't be on the

00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,800
advisor you

00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,660
in Perez presence at the advisory board

00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,400
but these are the official advisory

00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,430
board companies so they're all very

00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:51,040
different they all have very large

00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,680
commitments to Scala and need it to

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,500
survive further you know lots of things

00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,119
to exist as it is but you know we have

00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:01,089
everything from consulting companies to

00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,390
as you can see a bank IBM so this is

00:53:01,089 --> 00:53:06,880
mostly the IBM support technology center

00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:08,770
because Scala SPARC is based in Scala of

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,180
course so these are these are sort of

00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:13,300
the companies who say yeah we think

00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:15,339
whatever is important this or that and I

00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,880
mean I you'll be able to see in a few

00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:21,010
days exactly which initiative which

00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,119
company proposed you can see all the

00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,920
details of this meeting that we had

00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:26,109
there's like I said totally totally

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,270
everything is in the open there's a

00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:30,040
github repository it's I showed it on a

00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:31,809
previous slide but that's pretty easy to

00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,859
remember it's Scylla Center slash

00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:40,119
advisory board so this is going to be

00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:42,700
part of this sip slip initiative we're

00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:46,660
not going to just do this and not follow

00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:48,220
a protocol so one we're going to update

00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,869
this sip slip process there's a number

00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,880
of repository well a number there's one

00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:55,200
repository where all these these

00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:59,049
proposals are sitting and we have

00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:01,329
actually maybe Seth you know do you know

00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:02,859
where like where the announcements are

00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:04,299
made for the sip split meetings there's

00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:06,369
like a Twitter announcement or something

00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:07,599
that Josh makes sometimes he's like

00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:10,270
tweeting that we're having a meeting

00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:12,849
it's a it's an on-air hangouts so you

00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:15,010
can just like pop in and like listen to

00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,930
it and ask questions live during it you

00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:18,040
can also watch it offline on YouTube but

00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,849
do you remember where he's announcing it

00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:21,430
or is he just announced about his

00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:22,960
personal ok so basically we are

00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:25,210
announcing it but in an irregular

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,510
fashion on different I don't know

00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:29,380
Twitter versus git er maybe so it's a

00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:32,410
good point we should probably

00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,940
standardize on hey hitting up the

00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,650
mailing list Schuyler internals and then

00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,750
maybe tweeting from Schuyler Lang that

00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,670
we're doing it you know and an hour and

00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,319
you can join and here's the link we

00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:43,450
should we should do that next but in

00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:46,420
general there's always always these sip

00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:47,890
slip meetings that you can sit down or

00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,510
you can you can join because they're on

00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:50,950
air and you can post questions and we

00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:51,670
answer those questions during the

00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,110
meeting

00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,840
did you guys know about that by the way

00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:57,610
who knew about that existing basically

00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,180
