Abstract:
A talk with two main agenda items:
how we came to the decision of basing our microservices off Akka cluster, and
how we implemented this microservice platform - architecture, tips, lessons learned, and a couple of open source libraries we released to facilitate microservice development with Akka cluster, including a piece of reactive feature we contributed to the Akka core.
