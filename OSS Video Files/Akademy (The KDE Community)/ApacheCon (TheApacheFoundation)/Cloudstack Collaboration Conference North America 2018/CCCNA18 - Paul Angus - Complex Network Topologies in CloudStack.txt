good morning everyone

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,199
as so nicely introduced I'm cool Angus

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:17,310
from shake blue and today I'm going to

00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:19,289
be talking about complex networks and

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,750
keeping that and thoughts around that

00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,949
and showing what we're doing in class

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,640
that world about it

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,859
the very brief summary with the number

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,119
that keeps kicking up there how many

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,150
years I've been doing this kind of thing

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,180
is getting depressingly high but

00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,940
basically I work with a blue and my main

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,950
focus is looking at what everyone's

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,920
trying to do with cloud stack for our

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,720
customers and just general conversations

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,400
and then trying to see if I can see a

00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,520
pattern on something that would be of

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,210
use and interest of people that we might

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,250
have thought of before

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,190
so this with complex networks and I

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,690
start off giving an idea of what what

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,409
I'm talking about when I'm saying a

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,039
complex network then because it kind of

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,409
fits in a slight digression into nfe in

00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:14,039
the virtualized world and then talking

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:16,259
about what we've called from one of a

00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:18,270
better name next generation networks was

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:23,609
it kind of sounds caching you put it it

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:27,210
also uses in the real world then it goes

00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,490
nicely into layer 2 networks with again

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,920
another slight digression config drives

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,109
and then just too quick around up and

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,549
look up what which one do and next with

00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:40,770
those networks so the first step yes is

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,609
to talk about what complex networks are

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:47,039
in the first place and what really I'm

00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,590
talking about here things have done fit

00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,800
into a classic cloud stack he's a Rooter

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,370
and a network

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,480
stuff on it or in the case of the papacy

00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:58,180
through each other with a couple of

00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,670
networks all coming off that and we do

00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,650
take a bit of well you do it our way or

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,630
the highway in terms of what you can do

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,370
with networking we've got a very

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,560
specific way that networking kind of

00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:13,270
works and most corporate networks

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,160
enterprise networks just don't look like

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,500
that they've got quite different look

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,610
and feel so just trolling around on

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,530
looking for images of nice diagrams of

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,360
people's networks when you look at these

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,580
you see they don't really look anything

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,190
like what we would normally put together

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,470
into our stack and we've got people who

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,850
do specialists that kind of networks

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,680
that do specialist jobs guys from

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,870
Vitello here and are they're doing

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,580
really interesting stuff with network

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,220
appliances and using cloud stack to

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,300
drive implementing network appliances in

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,310
their infrastructure and then also we

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,200
have the kind of Holy Grail that people

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,270
talk about and look for which is the

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,640
hybrid cloud how can you really have

00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,430
cloud stack working with all of those

00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,660
other kind of clouds or on-site and

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,130
premise networks branch offices how can

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,959
you make cloud stack fitted with all

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:12,700
these things and I said about our

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,880
virtual router sitting in the middle of

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,610
it one thing that is important in these

00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,620
complex networks are the virtualized

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,170
appliances the only major Avenger of

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,959
offenders have now all have a

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,250
virtualized version of the physical

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,070
appliances that people would have been

00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,989
putting in their data centers they all

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,959
see that virtualization is the way this

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:38,620
is going largely and so they've

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,400
introduced variants of their appliances

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:45,370
that are virtualized and if you remember

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,560
those engines the citrix netscaler the

00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:50,940
vp X's have been about we've got no time

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,220
as long as I could remember that that

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,620
has been about as a thing so they've

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,930
long can't have embraced that idea and

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,810
everyone else is getting in on the act

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:07,920
as well so are they only slightly

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,870
off-topic have a talk about NFV because

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,690
it's the big marketing thing that people

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,980
will talk about in terms of putting

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,530
these appliances into networks and the

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,780
key really benefit is we you can deploy

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,750
a one of these appliances really easily

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,000
and you get the template of the virtual

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,850
machine and you start it up and there it

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,310
is and then you sit there plumb

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,970
configuring it and connecting it mostly

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,320
in our software-defined world we really

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,150
want to be able to automate that we

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,310
don't want people sitting there at

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,480
consoles having to do these things

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:50,370
wherever possible so NFB which are

00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:53,520
networked the function virtual network

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,850
function virtualization ie the thing in

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,730
trying to do virtualized came about and

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:02,070
the real problem is that because you saw

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,870
just a tiny list of appliances we have a

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,700
great big list of appliances they all

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,620
work in different ways and how do you

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,840
basically orchestrate all of those

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,220
things so there is a standard and

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,950
interesting is trying to bring about

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,550
standard where all these things talk to

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:25,430
each other and unfortunately it looks

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:27,600
something like this you have multiple

00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,400
components in here all of which work

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,009
together to find

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,630
allow your whatever it is your sister a

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:41,310
SAV and your by Otto a brocade the

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:44,560
Reuter altar that live nicely together

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:47,590
and when you look at it you've just got

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,720
this one instance here which is the

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,280
virtual instance that is actually the

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,289
thing that everything else is trying to

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,860
give you it's the cisco has a as I said

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:03,699
origin VSR exits whatever that thing is

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,680
just sitting there now now that vendor

00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,720
will have what they call an element

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,520
manager which is the thing that then

00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:15,190
passes in configuration data and health

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,770
checks to that system because it is

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,720
proprietary nine times ten whatever that

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,389
thing is it will be proprietary and so

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,050
they create a proprietary thing to talk

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:28,840
to it over the interface between that

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,539
element manager and what we call the

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,449
virtual network function manager now

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:36,760
become standardized so there is this

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,070
standardized piece in the middle which

00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,099
basically connects the two things

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:45,580
together through a a unknown Channel and

00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:48,400
you know principles of working so you

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,530
have to add that in but that obviously

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,090
needs to start the virtual machine stop

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,630
the virtual machine created in the first

00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,880
place

00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,539
because they say it's it's the prior two

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,639
sets of VM template so we get into

00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:05,050
having some kind of infrastructure

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,960
manager and the manager has to manage

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:12,550
something and that's our network and

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:17,050
hardware stack the the guest machine

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:19,030
who's going to sit on now from a class

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,740
that point of view that all looks really

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,500
really complicated everything or why

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,990
would you want to do that stuff but it

00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,300
turns out if you look at the model that

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,780
we've had in cloud stack four-way vo

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:34,840
before that standard was probably even

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,389
thought of we have taken our standard

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,260
classic model we have our business logic

00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:43,370
here

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:48,520
stack Colonel here some adapters and an

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:52,670
actual network alum network room 10 a

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,310
virtual network service provider so our

00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:57,620
driver if you like and as he moves

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,590
through you kind of look at it and go oh

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,080
that fits actually quite very nicely on

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,680
top of that model all those pieces seem

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,870
to be in exactly the same place so we

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,530
actually have already invented our own

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:14,930
nfe a years ago we just kind of didn't

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,450
need to call it that

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:22,760
so at the end of the day in this case

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:24,890
our vnf is just a guest instance in a

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,590
new space that's a virtual router but

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,560
with the second layer of orchestration

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,780
clouds that infrastructure creates the

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:37,810
virtual machine and then something else

00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:40,760
is going in and configuring it for us so

00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,280
we're not actually in classic tones

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,410
quite very far away from this any feed

00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,030
thing that people like to talk about and

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,500
we've got a lot of the building blocks

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:54,080
already there but there are some some

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,840
pieces missing even in in kind of that

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,580
spatial cloud stack you can see that

00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,220
we've said it didn't used to be able to

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,720
have layer 2 network though we've kind

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,410
of been working on that and we've sorted

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,630
that one we still need to have ranges of

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,400
public IPS the rather than the kind of

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,410
getting them piecemeal one by one and

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,300
then having to map them through to into

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,850
the individual virtual machines most

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,300
people want two of them whether

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:22,269
whatever they want the place in cloud

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,370
stacks networks the virtual Rooter is

00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,470
kind of fixed point in the same place we

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,990
can't get it out the way very easily or

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,000
move it to the side and still keep

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,649
functions that you'd want that and also

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,230
that virtual router

00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:38,680
it's our virtual route you can't put

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,050
anything else there very easily and just

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:46,930
in terms of cloud stack or estate what

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:50,230
it's doing so q next generation networks

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:53,380
as which is now cooled them and the

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,209
purpose of them is to allow enterprises

00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,529
or corporate networks or people who

00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,750
would want to do something other than

00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,449
the layout of a network that we

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:04,600
currently do allow them to replicate

00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:09,160
that in their cloud space the virtual

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,779
space so they providers can flow even an

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,880
internal economy you could say yeah all

00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:15,310
that stuff you were doing with your

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,610
physical staff and you had your servers

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:20,350
and you had your firewalls and Wan

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,839
accelerators and all that we can

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:28,660
basically lift that up and replicate

00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:32,259
that in a cloud space so to get there

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:36,149
we're looking at we've got to change

00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:40,089
some bits in there and I'll talk through

00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:42,730
the new concepts that we need think we

00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,639
need to do that and so we're going to

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,290
introduce the idea of topologies and

00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,720
shall explain in a second

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:53,110
then this enterprise topology to fit

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,569
into that a new type of virtual routes

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,970
and explain why they still need a some

00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,670
kind of Rooter in there and then the new

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,310
network types that we think would be

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,589
appropriate and then we could look at

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:10,959
what we do want to do doing already with

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:13,930
that network appliances so for the

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,569
topologies what we thought was well it's

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:20,470
all kind of a bit confusing if you've

00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:21,150
got a isolated network is just is it

00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:23,840
gonna network

00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:27,960
that's okay I've got that virtual Rooter

00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,240
stuff on it shared network okay well a

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,570
VP see we can't call it a savvy PC

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,920
Network but it's got a lot of networks

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,780
so we're kind of using the same Turner

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,040
twice once for the kind of big thing

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,820
around the outside and then once three

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:43,980
little bits inside and then if we go

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,650
into this kind of enterprise topology I

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,470
do that all over the place that's gonna

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,800
get really confusing so we said what if

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,870
we gotta move up a layer and say shared

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,500
and isolated now folks are actually a

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:00,480
type of topology a VPC is a type of

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,760
topology and then this enterprise

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,500
network is at the type of topology we

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,780
can then have all of them and they kind

00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:12,510
of now have buckets and layers that they

00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:15,120
sitting so then we move on to this idea

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,090
of the enterprise topology and also here

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,880
is vastly simplified simplified versus

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:23,490
the things that I'd shown before of what

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,040
people might want to do but simply here

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:30,000
we have this router that I'll come back

00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:32,280
to and then the idea will a user device

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,500
and that user device is likely in

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,560
networks to be maybe a one accelerator

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,280
but it could be just a normal route or

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,440
if I act up for Kade now or Cisco or

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,470
whatever you want to put there and then

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
we said well then there might be this

00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,460
you put a file there maybe it's a

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,710
virtual pix file or sitting there off

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,870
that you might want this layer 2 network

00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,820
which just doesn't have IP addresses

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,030
come on to the explaining more about

00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,950
that in a moment and that will that

00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,200
would be your dmz would tell the pics

00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,700
that that interfaces there is the DMZ

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,250
and then you'll have your corporate

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,380
network

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,300
here for instance and those can all go

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,190
off in different ways and do different

00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:19,600
things and that's just a very simple

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:22,270
corporate a corporate implementation so

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,980
we said okay so we've now got these

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,330
typologies with different types of

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:29,110
shapes of networks to mind together

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,540
we've got the idea that we're going to

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:35,050
have an enterprise one but we still need

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,750
to get data from public space down to

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:41,080
these networks we can't just let people

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,090
kind of say well use this IP address and

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,280
short be fine don't or these are your

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,900
range or please don't use any other ones

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,940
because there isn't that that's not

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,490
gonna work well not for long you're

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:55,570
going to have to protect other users

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,580
from malicious or accidental people

00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,810
basically picking up other people's IP

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,910
addresses we're going to have to have

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,670
some way of doing that and for that

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:06,820
we've we've said we'll have this

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,040
enterprise work for router and what kind

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:13,180
of networking people would call a

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:16,300
handoff so the handoff being this is

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,060
your cable on the end of this cable as a

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,550
whole load of IP addresses and your next

00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,290
hop will be X but what are you doing

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,230
your cable plug it into it every one you

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:29,100
want to plug it into one VM okay fine do

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,990
that if you want to plug it into your

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,910
appliance you're my accelerator brake

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,820
and then put behind that whatever you

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,680
want or you plug it straight to router

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,170
the choice is all yours but what that

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,120
virtual router its job is basically to

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,850
get data so that the IP address is

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,760
assigned through itself as fast as it

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:52,000
physically can and make sure that it's

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,500
stopping other people using your life be

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,020
addresses your public ones and stopping

00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,270
you using other than that we do not do

00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,420
some jobs they've been vastly simplified

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:06,670
simplified but it's got a very specific

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:09,200
job in there and so the south part of

00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,420
this where the user starts to see some

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,940
little whines almost just dangling down

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,580
there network cable that you've given

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,620
them virtual network cable we then say

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,450
vision is the gateway that you would

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,540
connect to this is the range of IP

00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:24,350
addresses you can use go knock

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:28,930
yourselves out

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:31,430
do whatever you want there will be some

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:36,740
world would have to do above that with

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:40,270
routing so the upper northbound route is

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:44,360
nowhere to send traffic we already have

00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:47,780
OSPF in cloud stack so there's already

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,170
support for that so we'll look at either

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:55,070
just using that for the moment or adding

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,600
has it been to something to move it

00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:03,040
forward so that those readers can talk

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:06,860
to the core routers and route traffic so

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,780
now we've got some ideas and concepts of

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,150
how it might all fit together we still

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,530
need to look at those networks they're

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:15,380
little bits of glue that's was sticking

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:17,120
things together and in a normal class

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,340
that world you create network you're

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,780
going to possibly get a virtual return

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,620
you can see you don't wander further a

00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:27,040
router but you will end up with a load

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,630
of IP addresses you've got to assign and

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,470
Klaus that will not assign IP addresses

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,130
if you assign a big range you can't use

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,320
that range

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,770
elsewhere in cloud static right there if

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,750
you assign a tiny little range you'll

00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,610
deploy for virtual machines on there

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,470
even though you're not using the IP

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,730
addresses in that range Klaus that were

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,560
saying yeah but I've run out of IP

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,450
addresses now you only gave before I

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,090
know you didn't expect to use them but

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:59,210
still before so that's kind of very

00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:01,160
constricting and also very messy so we

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,180
came up with the well really what people

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,430
just want is a v-mail

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,400
they want their network cable which is

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,270
can plug in wherever they were

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,860
particularly for things like service

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:17,360
chaining where you're connecting is

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:18,920
purely one Rooter to a ran accelerator

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,870
that's just one cable between two

00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:26,960
places you don't want to hold network to

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:29,210
just need a okay effectively and so by

00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:32,260
taking out all the IP addressing you

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:35,210
then leave it to you to use their own

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,860
Active Directory or iPad find a solution

00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,510
for passing out IP addresses maybe

00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,000
people want to do the more statically

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:43,370
doesn't really make sense but maybe they

00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,390
do but classic is just giving you a

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,920
network you can do what you like with

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,780
and then we thought well that's great

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,620
but some people do want something in the

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:57,100
middle we're cloud stack is giving out

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,320
which is doing that kind of thing

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,410
so we can make it simple for them where

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,350
they can put in their own Reuter their

00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,510
own whatever appliance and we will just

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,120
give out IP addresses but we're allow

00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:13,880
the user to tell us what that ranges and

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,620
what the Gateway is so they can have

00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,950
their route and say right I've treated a

00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,770
router

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:21,130
I've put it on this IP address and now

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,390
bring a network connected to that and

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:26,450
the virtual rooms will be giving out the

00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:29,410
IP addresses with their Rooter as their

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:32,030
gateway which will then hop on out them

00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,800
it's just to give people a bit of a head

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,890
start if they don't know down a cell but

00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:40,340
in for blocks or Active Directory from

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,440
this stuff obviously a Linux box would

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,810
give out addresses just like anything

00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,880
else as well but it's a just a simple

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:52,790
user network and so we come kind of back

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,060
to the drawing a diagram I had earlier

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:58,430
so we now have Enterprise Rooter which

00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,380
is just effectively filtering traffic to

00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,590
make sure only the

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,000
that should get through to us then

00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,770
someone who's probably going to put

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,450
there weren't accelerated there which

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,390
would probably connect to some other

00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,650
network somewhere else they're going to

00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:17,280
put their virtual firewall VPN device

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:19,390
whatever thing they want to put in there

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,160
and then they could create their

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,930
lighting Network off that and say that

00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:28,750
could be a DMZ whether they're putting

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:32,230
over that and then off that another

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,810
l2 network and in this case where is it

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:38,470
here we are someone would have a active

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:41,640
directory doing that DNS DHCP and then

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:46,990
some user instances connected off that

00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:49,570
you know goes well but the idea is that

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,100
this can screw all over the place we can

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,050
be putting networks wherever you like

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,160
this one could have a layer 2 network

00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:58,690
off and could be some other device

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,280
basically you come up with a topology

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,830
you want and you can connect anything

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,270
and put it in any appliance there that

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:09,190
you want and a simple network there

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,590
we're showing where someone's created

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,390
this router of their own and down here

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,900
they've got the simple network so that's

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,690
dealing with the DNS and DHCP and these

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,050
guest instances are just being given the

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,340
IP addresses lying there as the gateway

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,890
remembering that all those IP addresses

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,950
assigned inside that space are

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,250
completely up to the user themselves

00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,470
whoever's designing this network

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,930
they like in that and it's just

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,630
everything specially protected just that

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,750
it is like going to your eyes pay in

00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,850
with your whatever setup we've got your

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,380
corporate offices or data centers and

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,870
they are passed in you

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,790
they cable and out of the Rueter they've

00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,210
installed and said right do what you

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,190
like

00:20:51,210 --> 00:21:01,200
those of you dresses do whatever you

00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:02,790
want so my little digression the layer 2

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,260
networks they were they seemed really

00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,730
popular when we before the ma'am we've

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,820
got a lot of questions about them a lot

00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,580
people are interested in but people also

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,250
said ok but if we haven't got a virtual

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:18,930
router what about the user data and

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:20,790
metadata and we said well handily enough

00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:24,720
the guys in new I've been doing a load

00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:27,120
of work on the gun food drive for kind

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,600
of very similar reason so that's use

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:35,550
that the metadata in that conflict Drive

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,100
includes the instance is hostname but

00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,230
also we kind of went around in a circle

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,580
and say okay well the your VM can always

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:44,220
it can always go after something else

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,110
and ask that thing what it what it

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,400
should do is say how kind of

00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,100
configuration management often works

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,790
would like say actually pop it but then

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,560
we said ah but the VM has just come up

00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,900
the instance has to be able to identify

00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,720
itself to whatever system is going to

00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,260
give its conflict can't say hi Here I am

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,230
Who am I

00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,180
the the thing go I don't know you tell

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:11,790
me and I'll give you whatever packages

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:13,860
and stuff you need so you need that user

00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,070
data metadata to get into the instance

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:21,350
first to then kind of kickstart and

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:23,490
carry on even I Pam systems which work

00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,710
you don't need to pass the MAC address

00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,980
twos they still need a host of the nice

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:35,370
pin what what they're going to set you

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:38,430
up as so the config drive is basically a

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:41,070
tiny little ISO a cd-rom effectively

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,590
with as the guest instance seizure that

00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,490
gets mounted in the

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:51,500
second position of the kind of widening

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,539
stack it can be stored on secondary

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,580
storage but there's also an option to

00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:57,890
have that put onto primary storage

00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,020
instead but the reason being is some

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:04,309
people will say being on secondary is a

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,140
little bit over security risk a lot of

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:07,669
people can get at secondary storage is

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,980
very easy to get stuff in and out of

00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:12,020
this whereas the particularly of block

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,179
storage if it's on primary storage it's

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,159
much harder to read this ISO and just

00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:18,200
see what's in it which was asleep

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,860
include a load of user data metadata the

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:25,010
people of center inside this cd-rom

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,809
there will be two directories that we

00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,429
are clouds that one which contains all

00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,610
the cloud stack metadata as it would

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,409
normally be passed and as it happens and

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,679
opens that one was poor interested in a

00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:47,600
little bit normally we wouldn't dare lay

00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:49,820
a glove on OpenStack but people but we

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,429
need a mechanism to get this data that's

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,169
on a cd-rom over here into our guest

00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:56,600
instance just cuz it's there doesn't get

00:23:54,169 --> 00:24:00,409
it don't do anything just cuz it's there

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,649
and the kind of saving grace there is

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:05,390
cloud in it and cloud in it started as a

00:24:03,649 --> 00:24:07,960
boon to thing and then there so he

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:13,220
ported it over to most of the major

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:15,799
linux oasis and a cloud base of donna a

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:19,700
Windows version so pretty much everyone

00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,260
covered there and cloud in it as allowed

00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,970
to have different data sources and there

00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:27,470
are whole loads them obviously aimed WS

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:29,870
and Azure and Google cloud data sources

00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,610
so they can pick up data from there but

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,679
there is actually a built in clouds that

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,529
one but that's expecting to find the

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,860
virtual router but there is also a

00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:45,010
config drive there

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:48,549
of the data sources and so what config

00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:53,019
drive uses the OpenStack configuration

00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:57,250
for a drive disk configuration drive

00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:59,340
disk they have their own setup of what

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:05,860
what you could put in and where it goes

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:07,779
so going on to a massive now digression

00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,519
I was trying to find just some

00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:12,929
documentation that gave me the layout

00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,309
and I could open the sick one of the

00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,919
config drives and look to see where was

00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,510
a bits of fire went but I thought there

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,190
must be just some documentation eleven I

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,799
said get to know something I'll just get

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:30,970
hold of that and now I went to the

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:33,909
OpenStack user guides and found 18 19

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,130
different user guides our lives on Samos

00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:37,630
not their metal computer it could be

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,220
because that's a way to start container

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:44,590
don't think it's bad dashboard for me

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:50,590
not undecided oh well that's what the

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:53,350
I'm going to put down a shrug but what I

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,720
do know is it does work if you use

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,429
config drive with the later networks it

00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,220
will get its hostname it will get all

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:03,669
the user data pass to it that my cloud

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,830
in it it does work kind of how it's

00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:11,049
supposed to so that's the end of my

00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:13,630
OpenStack oh no nice that so getting

00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:17,649
towards the end if we get back to the

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:19,149
layer 2 networks again our next step is

00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:21,070
to look at them and we've got a few

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:23,190
users who do that or use the later

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:27,220
networks but and want to use it with

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:29,559
systems such as Infoblox our started

00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:32,139
conversations even for blocks about what

00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,269
we might do with them there are two ways

00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:36,970
in which you could pass data there is

00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:39,730
info block telling cloud stack what my P

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,440
addresses issues it's assigned to a VM

00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,260
because people kind of still like to see

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,500
their IP address in the

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,480
as CloudStack UI but also if they're

00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,490
integrating they also want to be able to

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,800
say on that VM what is its IP address

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,020
via the cloud stack API people love that

00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,730
class I gave the I and now suddenly the

00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,800
IP address isn't there because it was

00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,980
assigned over there so we could suck

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,440
that back in or we could do it the other

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,750
way round which is where we create the

00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,750
virtual machine and we to quickly tell

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:14,370
your I Pam your Infoblox we created this

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:17,400
virtual machine with this MAC address be

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:20,040
warned set up your your records of that

00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,750
so when the machine appears it says

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,490
here's what it seems the MAC address

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,890
understands it and assigns it the names

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:29,480
of clouds that's led to a sign but it

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,250
was Infoblox that drove the cycle just

00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,000
actually assigns the IP addresses and

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:38,040
decides what was getting wrong so that's

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,120
the kind of next step with the layer two

00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,220
stuff and I think now just a brief look

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,850
at the network appliances because we

00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,160
went over them and as I said before they

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:53,280
are still just basically guest instances

00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,740
you can go and download for p.m. we're

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,890
often most of them are an OVA and

00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,680
download it and sent it to recenter and

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:04,140
pops answers Here I am I am now a Cisco

00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:08,820
or NetScaler or whatever it happens to

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,960
be but in class Deb is alone we don't

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,490
people probably don't want those

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,810
appearing in their list of virtual

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,850
machines they're kind of a different

00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:18,360
thing and we certainly don't want

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,830
probably some value a company wouldn't

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,150
want many users start seeing this

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,750
virtual machine in they aren't playing

00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,640
with it

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,930
it's we want it somewhere else and want

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,940
it to appear in our list of network

00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,740
things so we're gonna have to just put

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,200
some kind of flag in somewhere to say

00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:34,740
these are network appliances of some

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,010
sort but also an 11 network appliances

00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,600
often have multiple discs which is a bit

00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:42,420
of a problem for us

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,390
so we have wanted to deal with that I

00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,730
also show

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:51,660
example in a second extra configuration

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:54,169
data the network appliances often need

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,299
something some knowledge

00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:57,259
more than just how many sinking you and

00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:59,239
how much RAM

00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:02,889
they'll have been especially designed in

00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:05,749
some way to do more than just beer

00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:07,850
actively and not guest instance there's

00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:12,440
going to be other stuff going on but

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:15,739
always is so to look at an example of

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,019
this cisco sa there is just a single

00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:22,960
line of what it calls extra convict here

00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:26,509
which needs to be passed into the

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,690
startup the vmx that kind of defines the

00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:32,600
virtual machine in the first place

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:35,690
there's also a whole load of questions

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,249
it asks about what's my hostname

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,779
supposed to be actually wasn't my IP

00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:41,330
address supposed to be

00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,220
how many interfaces do you want me to

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,999
have all sorts of things that are

00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:50,269
questions that are stored in the UI

00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:53,799
template itself and when you deploy it

00:29:50,269 --> 00:29:55,850
you get asked and then within the VMware

00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,899
environment the vCenter will inject all

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:04,519
that into the final vm x descriptor of

00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:06,649
the machine so we need to deal with that

00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:09,769
stuff to really be able to use network

00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:12,980
appliances well we've got the building

00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:17,059
blocks taking shape we already have a

00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:18,710
multi-disc OVA s-- that we can import so

00:30:17,059 --> 00:30:21,019
as a portlet show pull requests there

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:25,249
again two masters that's in merge so

00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:26,960
that's there already very shortly and

00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:28,850
probably the next couple of weeks we'll

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,580
have to pull requests in for sending

00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,940
extra configuration data to virtual

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:39,580
machines that's been worked on by

00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:44,299
Dingaan ii and that's going to work for

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:46,279
k vm VMware and XenServer there will be

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,779
a security around that where you've got

00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:50,359
global settings to say whether an

00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:53,299
administrator can pass extra data to vm

00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:54,390
and whether a user is allowed to put it

00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:56,790
somewhere

00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,700
you say particularly users or particular

00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,940
accounts can con because obviously you

00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,500
can't do damage if you start passing

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,240
low-level hardware stuff through to a

00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,820
virtual machine started up it can start

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,750
getting in the way but that will become

00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:16,650
a choice of the cloud operator whether

00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:19,140
that's even allowed by anybody or not it

00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:24,840
will depend on what they use case for

00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:27,420
this kind of feature a bit it's also so

00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,200
that that is generic it means anything

00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,230
you want to add to that VMs or to the

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,630
XML of a KVM machine you can add at

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,580
start I'll just say this is extra stuff

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,810
I want you to store and always pass

00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:46,440
through when you start this virtual

00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:48,240
machine so that was my gonna overview of

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,730
where we're trying to go and what we're

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,790
trying to do with these networks it's it

00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:56,850
makes some it's a very good onboarding

00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,710
for corporates and various companies are

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,040
trying to do more than just the network

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:04,800
piece start off with maybe their endgame

00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,260
will actually be some kind of container

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,540
services and what-have-you but they

00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,730
still have their what's called it legacy

00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:13,710
everyone likes to then legacy

00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:16,490
infrastructure which they could

00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,840
basically lift up keep all of the

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,610
expertise of knowledge that they have

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,850
and maybe all the licensing that paid

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,890
for and move it into the cloud just lift

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,970
it up copy it over here and do the same

00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,540
again and maybe you've been using

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:32,370
reusing bits of conflict they had before

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,020
and that's going to allow an adoption

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,420
and then they can sit in this cloud

00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,010
space and star cream containers as well

00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,050
maybe connecting that into that Network

00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,730
and then you figure out actually we can

00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,750
get rid of those services that used to

00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,220
write contain our studies and

00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,760
migrate rather than have to have a big

00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,260
bang

00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,120
move over and also if it's all people

00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,520
who may not be looking to make any kind

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,560
of change any couple anytime soon and

00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,480
just go well if I can have all mine

00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,860
all the stuff I had here but having it

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,140
in the cloud and I don't have to do it

00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,210
someone else's way I can carry on do it

00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:09,040
yet the way I've always done it but now

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:11,330
it's virtualized that's the kind of

00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,490
direction we're kind of trying to take

00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,580
all this at the moment it doesn't

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,740
replace and mean that anything that used

00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,950
to be there has to go or will go

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,900
it just gives another option of how

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,240
people can work this cloud stack and the

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:33,370
trade networks and doing whatever it is

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,370
they want to drive any questions on that

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:44,200
awesome so the obligatory we're hiring

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,690
so if you know people who are looking to

00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,160
work on Klaus that work on futures just

00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:52,990
write codes and do that stuff make some

00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,330
of this kind of thing happen and some of

00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,070
the other stuff that people will be

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,770
talking about please come and see

00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:06,400
preferably me cuz there's noises in it

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:06,700
you introduce a just me only me that'll

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,760
be great

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:19,809
oh and that was it thank you very much

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,809
