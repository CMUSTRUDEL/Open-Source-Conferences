Apache Ignite is a powerful in-memory computing platform. The Apache IgniteSink streaming connector enables users to inject Flink data into the Ignite cache. Join Saikat Maitra to learn how to build a simple data streaming application using Apache Flink and Apache Ignite. This stream processing topology will allow data streaming in a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant manner, which can process data sets consisting of virtually unlimited streams of events. Apache IgniteSink offers a streaming connector to inject Flink data into the Ignite cache. The sink emits its input data to the Ignite cache. The key feature to note is the performance and scale both Apache Flink and Apache Ignite offer. Apache Flink can process unbounded and bounded data sets and has been designed to run stateful streaming applications at scale. Application computation is distributed and concurrently executed in clusters. Apache Flink is also optimized for local state access for tasks and does checkpointing of local state for durability. Apache Ignite provides streaming capabilities that allow data ingestion at a high scale in its in-memory data grid.
