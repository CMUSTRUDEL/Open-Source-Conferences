The world of business applications is evolving. Monolithic applications are being split up into smaller microservices and deployed into virtualized environments. Engineers are striving to achieve responsiveness, resilience and elasticity at the same time improving separation of concerns and deployments via CI. The tradeoffs are usually more complex operations, harder dependency testability, lower developer productivity in some cases and cognitive overhead as well as infrastructure costs. We will discuss how our team at Netflix is settling in the middle between monolithic and microservice architectures getting the best of the two worlds. We’ll go through different phases of the application development lifecycle from initiation to production deployment as well as we’ll talk how Apache Karaf enables us to achieve the aforementioned properties of the systems we build.
