Emerging data-driven use cases in the manufacturing business often require continuous integration and analysis of sensor data to identify time-critical situations. Apache StreamPipes is a new project in the Apache Incubator which aims at providing a self-service industrial IoT toolbox to enable non-technical users to connect, analyze and explore IoT data streams. It provides many connectors for industrial communication protocols and a library of reusable algorithms to analyze sensor measurements or camera images based on simple rules up to machine learning methods. A variety of data sinks allow for easy exchange with third party systems, including many Apache IoT and Big Data projects (including Apache PLC4X, Apache Kafka, Apache IoTDB). In this talk, we give an overview of Apache StreamPipes (incubating) and interactively show how to extend the IoT toolbox and create a custom data processor using the integrated Software Development Kit.

Patrick Wiener currently works at the FZI Research Center for Information Technology in Karlsruhe. His research interests include Distributed Computing (Cloud, Edge/Fog Computing), IoT, and Stream Processing. Patrick is an expert for infrastructure management such as containers and container orchestration frameworks. He has worked in several public-funded research projects related to Big Data Management and Stream Processing in domains such as manufacturing, logistics and geographical information systems.
