Apache cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) is an open-source Natural Language Processing system for extraction of information from Electronic Health Records (EHR). cTAKES consists of a number of components that work just with English documents. We integrated two important tools (HeidelTime and FreeLing) into cTAKES that provide language analysis functionalities (Temponym Tagging, Morphological Analysis, Named Entity Detection, PoS-Tagging, Parsing, Word Sense Disambiguation, Semantic Role Labelling, so forth) for a variety of languages. Also, we adapted HeidelTime’s grammar and FreeLing to the Medical domain in Spanish. Due to having different type systems in components of cTAKES and HeidelTime and FreeLing, we had interoperability challenges that were solved by adapting the native type system of cTAKES for HeidelTime and FreeLing’s Wrapper.
