00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,279
good morning

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,119
good afternoon good evening whatever it

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,239
is where you are

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,920
welcome to the second day of apachecon

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,239
2020. it's uh

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
it's really a delight to see all you

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,320
people here

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
i wish i could actually see you um this

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
is

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
this is the point on the second morning

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719
of the event where i always say

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,399
uh how did you enjoy the event so far

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
and everybody yells something from the

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,440
audience and i really miss that aspect

00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,280
of events

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,800
but there are things about doing this as

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
a virtual event that have been

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,159
so much better than anything we could do

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,760
in person

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,479
uh yesterday we had the first

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
apache con session in hindi ever and

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
that was

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,400
amazing we had a lot of content

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,159
yesterday and earlier this morning

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,640
in mandarin and we have a session later

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,200
today maybe tomorrow i forget in spanish

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,479
and so

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,119
it's just the the virtual platform

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:34,159
has opened us up to an enormously larger

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,159
speaker and attendee audience we have

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,720
more representation from africa this

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,640
year

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,479
than we've ever had before and i'm so

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
pleased about that

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
so there are some silver linings to

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,560
doing this

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
online for sure and i want to share with

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,439
you

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,200
uh just for a moment what our plans are

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,240
going forward

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
we are watching major tech companies and

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,680
their travel

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,799
restrictions on their employees and as

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,360
of right now

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
we are fully expecting that the 2021

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
event will also be virtual

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,879
so tell your friends we can have a uh

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
even bigger

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,480
turnout next time um

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
we'll definitely be updating this as we

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,200
as we get closer to that but that is

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,879
currently our plan with corporations

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
like google and facebook and ibm

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
having travel bans extending through

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,440
june so that's our thinking going

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
forward

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,959
i want to start by thanking our sponsors

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,160
as you all know we can't do this without

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,160
our sponsors

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,760
and we have so many sponsors that help

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
the foundation

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,599
these uh listed on this next few pages

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
are ones that are specifically

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
sponsoring this event and helping us

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,400
make this happen

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,560

ibm and imply please

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,239
take a moment sometime today to visit

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,159
these sponsor booths

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,840
thank them for sponsoring us and also

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
look at their goods and services so many

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,560
of these organizations

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,000
have built enormous infrastructure on

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
top of the work that we do

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,680
at the apache software foundation so do

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,560
go by and see what they're doing

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,480

now while i'm thanking sponsors i want

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,080
to take a moment to repeat something

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,639
that i said earlier today

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,840
uh i have a a huge thank you to go out

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:47,040
to the other people that made this event

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,720
possible and those are the track chairs

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,919
every time you're attending one of these

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,880
sessions

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
it's because somebody from that product

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
project

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,840
community stepped up to put together a

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,440
track of content

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,440
they worked with the speakers they

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,680
ensured that everybody was informed and

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,320
they put together this content

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
and they're essentially running many

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
conferences on their own i i simply

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,720
could not have done this

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,280
without the 26 individuals who have

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,520
stepped up to be track chairs

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,440
i also want to thank my friend and

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
colleague ruth seely who helped with so

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
many of the logistical aspects and

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,680
sponsor relations in this event

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,759
and my friend and colleague brian

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,759
proffitt who has been handling a lot of

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
the stuff behind the scenes on social

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
media

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
helping people test in the uh the test

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,160
room

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,840
and many other things around making sure

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,759
that this platform works the way that

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,919
it's supposed to so a huge thank you to

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,919
them

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,280
the next thing that i wish to mention is

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,440
that one of our sponsors

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,240
muse dev is running a bug bash

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
now i uh i'll be sharing some some more

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,800
statistics about this

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,759
with you tomorrow the last time i heard

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
there were five

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
teams that uh have signed up for the bug

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,440
bash

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
for those of you not familiar with it

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,560
musedev is a code analysis

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,720
tool so this is cool technology that

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,600
looks at the source code of your apache

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,720
project

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
and identifies potential problems in the

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,600
code

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,440
and the bug bash is teams competing to

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
address these problems they'll be judged

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,960
on

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
the frequency and quality of their pull

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,400
requests

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,479
to these projects and then those changes

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,080
will actually go into these projects

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,960
making them better for you

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
the user so that's pretty exciting there

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
do

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,000
look at ask.apache.org

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
bugbash for more information or drop by

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,759
the bug bash channel on

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,280
the slack instance i'll mention slack in

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,599
just a moment if you don't

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,680
already if you aren't already familiar

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,840
with that

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
now one of the things that we do when

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,280
you come to our

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,840
live events as we greet you at the door

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,639
and maybe give you

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,759
a t-shirt we can't do that this year

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,039
but we do have a t-shirt anyway i'm

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,840
wearing mine

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,360
isn't it awesome and uh this was this

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,960
was designed by one of our community

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
members ruth silly and what you'll

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
notice

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,639
is if you look close this is all one

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,639
continuous line

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
and that is symbolic of the way that

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,319
we're all connected

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,880
together through the apache software

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,000
foundation and open source communities

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,440
so it's uh both a lovely design and also

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,639
symbolic of what we do here

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,479
the other thing that we give you at

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,639
conferences is a uh

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,560
conference badge and if you if you look

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
behind me you'll see that that i i

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
collect

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,280
apache con badges i've been collecting

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,000
apache con badges for

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,599
for 20 years now so it was important to

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,440
me to have a badge for this event you

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,560
can get your own badge

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,680
at s.apache.org

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,520
aca h dash badge and

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,599
uh you can customize that and print that

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,800
download that and print that so you have

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,800
your own event badge

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
during the event there are a number of

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,720
ways that you can connect

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
with other attendees and also with the

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,879
uh

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
the event planners the first of these is

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,039
obviously the chat that is right next to

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,680
you

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
while you are watching me there are

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,440
chats that are

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,680
global for the whole event and also per

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
session so you can discuss with people

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,800
that are in the session that you're in

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,599
what's going on on stage

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
we also have a slack instance for those

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,240
who like

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:50,080
to chat on slack and you can join that

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:53,040

a room for each session i'm sorry not

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,920
each session each track

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
so you can go in that track and talk

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,080
with other people that are attending

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
that same

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,480
track um we have the hallway track which

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,640
is listed in the sessions and i was in

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
there for several hours this morning

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,360
having ad hoc conversations with other

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,320
attendees that was really productive

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,440
i encourage you to attend the hallway

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
track

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,480
and we have polls i notice in the chat

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,240
that suvendu just mentioned that this is

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,440
his first apache con

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,959
one of the polls asks how many times

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,640

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
together are making this

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,399
a really exciting event because one of
