A hands-on deep dive on using Apache NiFi + Edge Flow Manager + MiniFi Agents with Apache MXNet, OpenVino, TensorFlow Lite, and other Deep Learning Libraries on the actual edge devices including Raspberry Pi with Movidius 2, Google Coral TPU, NVidia Jetson Xavier, and NVidia Jetson Nano. We run deep learning models on the edge devices and send images, capture real-time GPS and sensor data. With our low coding IoT applications providing easy edge routing, transformation, data acquisition and alerting before we decide what data to stream real-time to our data space. These edge applications classify images and sensor readings real-time at the edge and then send Deep Learning results to Apache NiFi for transformation, parsing, enrichment, querying, filtering and merging data to various Apache data stores including Apache Kudu and Apache HBase. https://www.datainmotion.dev/2019/08/updating-machine-learning-models-at.html

Tim Spann is a Principal Field Engineer at Cloudera in the Data in Motion Team where he works with Apache NiFi, MiniFi, Kafka, Kafka Streams, Edge Flow Manager, MXNet, TensorFlow, Apache Spark, Big Data, IoT, Cloud, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Tim has over a decade of experience with the IoT, big data, distributed computing, streaming technologies, and Java programming. Previously, he was a senior solutions architect at AirisData and a senior field engineer at Pivotal. He blogs for DZone, where he is the Big Data Zone leader, and runs a popular meetup in Princeton on big data, IoT, deep learning, streaming, NiFi, blockchain, and Spark. Tim is a frequent speaker at conferences such as IoT Fusion, Strata, ApacheCon, Data Works Summit Berlin, DataWorks Summit Sydney, DataWorks Summit DC, DataWorks Summit Barcelona and Oracle Code NYC. He holds a BS and MS in computer science.
Sunile: As a open source first champion in the Data of Anything space, I have lead and enabled unreasonably successful data strategies for several premier fortune 100s. I simplify technical solutions through ubiquitous language for complex business challenges. Evangelism of open source adoption with a maniacal business centric solutions approach earned me the Hortonworks 2016 Technical Leadership Award. With paramount passion, I am a business enabler who has built from soup to nuts habitually secure, dynamic, scalable, distributed, versatile, and remunerative enterprise grade analytic and transactional solutions.
