00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,200
most important things

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,240
a big thank you to our sponsors we could

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,040
not do this

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,040
without our sponsors and so i want to

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,759
call special attention first of all to

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,640

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
educational event

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
is a critical part of that mission and

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
it's a part that

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
i've been able to play for all these

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,479

more to say about musedev in a moment

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,640
but i also want to take this opportunity

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,160
to give a special thank you

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
to the people that have helped me make

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
this event possible

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
and that is our track chairs these are

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
people that stepped up

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
to craft the content around their

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
product commune their project

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
communities

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,720

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,080
speakers into this

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,959

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
this event

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,519
and that would simply not have been

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,480
possible without our track chairs

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,200
i also want to uh make a special thank

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,760

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,360

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
aspects of this event

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799

so a huge thank you to these people for

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,360
helping me make this happen

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
next thing i want to mention very

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,720
important

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,120
our event is being run under the apache

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,840
software foundation code of conduct

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
and we take this very seriously we

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,400
expect that each one of you

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
has read and will abide by this code of

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,120
conduct it is linked from every page

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,159
on the uh the main event website at

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,120
apachecon.com

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,560
and we will be removing people from the

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
platform who do not

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,799
abide by this code of conduct so just

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,239
need to understand that that's what we

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,239
expect of our community here

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
the next thing that i want to mention uh

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,479
ordinarily when you walk in the door at

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,520
apache con

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,240
we give you some apache swag perhaps a

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,080
t-shirt

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,479
this year of course we can't do that and

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,240
we do miss seeing all of your smiling

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,800
faces at our event

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,880
but we do have a t-shirt which you can

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
order at the url that's on your screen

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,199
i'm actually uh

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,320
wearing it right now isn't that lovely

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,240
and you can order that at

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,840
the url that you see on your screen

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
we'll also be mentioning that on

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,080
on social media and in the various chats

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,800
if you don't have time to write that

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,800
down right now

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,120
another thing we do at in-person events

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,280
and as you can see i'm a little bit

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,360
obsessive about this i collect apache

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,080
con badges i have a large collection of

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
them on the wall

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,639
here and i wanted to make sure that i

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,360
had one for this event as well

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,840
if you go to the url on the screen you

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,639
can customize and print your apache con

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,520
badge in case you too collect conference

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,320
badges

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,240
so that's gonna look like this and i

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
need to find some card stock to print

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
this on at some point

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
during the event there are a number of

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,000
ways that you can connect

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:42,479
with your uh your fellow attendees

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
there is of course a chat on the hop in

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,199
platform itself

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,039
this chat is both there's a global chat

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,320
and then there is a per room chat so you

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
can talk with people that are in the

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,240
same session that you're in

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,440
and people across the entire event

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,680
we've also stood up a slack instance

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,280
and there's again a url on your screen

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
there which will again be mentioned

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,000
in the chats after this is over if you

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,120
don't have time to write it down

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,440
in that slack instance there's a

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
general room called apache con there are

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,160
also per

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,919
track rooms and many of our sponsors

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,039
also have a room there if you want to

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
have kind of a

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,199
quieter chat with one of these sponsors

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,199
about their products and services

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
in addition to this there is something

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,919
called the hallway track

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,520
now if you've been to in-person events

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,280
you know that the conversations you have

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,720
in the hallway outside the sessions are

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,039
every bit as important

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
as the sessions themselves so we've

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,039
created a hallway track which you will

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,080
see

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,479
in the session listing and

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,680
please do join in there and have

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,639
conversations

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
with your other attendees another thing

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
that we've done

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
is made some polls you'll see this at

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
the top right

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,599
of your screen uh if you click on polls

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,479
we've asked a couple questions there to

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,720
get some idea of who you are

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
last time i checked i noticed that 89

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,599
percent of you

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,120
this was your first apache con and

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,479
that's that's really exciting to me

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,680
because making this

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,720
event accessible to a larger community

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,720
is has been a a goal of mine for many

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,599
many years so it's really thrilling to

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,599

chat and one other thing that i really

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,720
want to draw attention to today

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,000
is the bug bash one of our sponsors

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,039
muse.dev is running a bug bash

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,240
and here's what that means news.dev

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,919
is a code analysis application

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
so what they've done is connect to some

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,599
of our github repos

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,720
and run their tool and identified some

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,440
bugs in the code

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
yes some apache code does have bugs in

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,759
it

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:32,000
and what you can do as an attendee is

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:35,200
