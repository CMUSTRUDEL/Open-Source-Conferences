Named Entity Recognition is at the core of all complete natural language processing tools. Out of the box clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) uses a dictionary containing part of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) that covers most common clinical terms. But it also comes with a custom dictionary creator. If you think that your clinical research is directed, then you should probably have a directed dictionary. UMLS subsets, non-english dictionaries and novel custom dictionaries have all been successfully used with cTAKES. This is an overview of cTAKES named entity recognition with the essential what, why and how of custom dictionaries as the centerpiece. Also discussed will be configuration to use discontiguous spans and subsumption of short terms.
