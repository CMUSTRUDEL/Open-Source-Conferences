	Advanced Dictionary use in Apache cTAKES
Sean Finan, Jeff Miller

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Named Entity Recognition is at the core of all complete natural language processing tools. Out of the box clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) uses a dictionary containing part of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) that covers most common clinical terms. But it also comes with a custom dictionary creator. If you think that your clinical research is directed, then you should probably have a directed dictionary. UMLS subsets, non-english dictionaries and novel custom dictionaries have all been successfully used with cTAKES. This is an overview of cTAKES named entity recognition with the essential what, why and how of custom dictionaries as the centerpiece. Also discussed will be configuration to use discontiguous spans and subsumption of short terms.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,359
okay

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,599
uh this is sean flynn uh if you

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,760
haven't seen one of these c-tape

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,520
sessions already i'm just going to tell

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,360
you

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,920
to put questions and comments in the

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,079
chat jeff miller will be

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
acting as the moderator he will collect

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
them

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,760
vet them collate them etc and pose them

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,760
later after i'm done speaking

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,399
okay so this is about advanced

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,520
dictionary use in apache c

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,680
takes okay

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,640
so my original plan was to talk about

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
the default apache ctx dictionary lookup

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,840
module

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
also called fast dictionary lookup

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,520
however and this is actually a good

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
thing

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,640
several other presentations will go over

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,200
both the defaults and customization

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:33,040
of the fast lookup module

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,560
so uh it's kind of silly for me to do

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,880
the same thing

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,600
as of course all of you are going to

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
watch those

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
other presentations uh and in addition

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
cmac just

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,399
spoke quite a bit about it so my new

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,759
plan

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,119
is to talk about a new case sensitive

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,799
dictionary lookup engine

00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:01,280
yeah nobody knows it exists right

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:04,560
it it does i checked it in last week

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,799
so uh there have been a lot of

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,440
conversations both in the past

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,440
and recently about problems with the

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,879
default dictionary lookup

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,400
and how it makes all kinds of mistakes

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,000
regarding uh case

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,360
what should be case sensitive

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,360
words so

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,640
i had when i created this new dictionary

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,560
lookup three main goals

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,599
one was to obviously add case

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,319
sensitivity to term discovery

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,040
the next was to make customization of

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,400
the runtime dictionary

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,560
look up easier and i'll talk

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
try to explain that a little bit later

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
and the third is to make

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,840
creation of the actual dictionary

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
database

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
more transparent to the user

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,440
okay so case sensitivity the new

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,640
database has three primary lookup tables

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,400
one with all uppercase terms and

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,040
as you might guess this has lots of

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,480
acronyms and abbreviations

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,959
one with mixed case terms

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,040
and this has lots of brand name

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,239
medications

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,040
not brand and then a

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,319
third lookup table with lower case terms

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,200
just all lowercase

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,480
and this is kind of a catch-all for

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,080
everything in the clinical document

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,200
if the node is all upper case no text is

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,400
all uppercase

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,120
then all three tables are used in order

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,319
again with mixed case all three tables

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,879
are used

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,959
lowercase all three tables are used now

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
this sounds a little goofy

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,799
but i will try to explain why this is

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
done later

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
now since all three tables are used

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,319
obviously something might be found

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,799
in more than one table so

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,959
we have conflict resolution performed by

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,879
a best match to a table

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
in other words if something is in the

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,879
upper case

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,920
all uppercase table and all lowercase

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,919
table

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,680
what is it in the text is it all

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680
uppercase or is it all lowercase

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,240
okay so some examples on the left

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,080
is a well not clinical note but

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,520
basically a bunch of lines that i stole

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,400
from a clinical note

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
i threw them in like this because they

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,600
fit my need

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,600
of having uppercase

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,840
terms so the

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,080
first line with first with further

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,400
seizure spinal tap and culture

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,840
csf the one with capitalized csf

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,880
was from the original document i copied

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,520
the line

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,919
lowercase csf to see what it found

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,199
on the right you can see what it found

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,800
for each line

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,800
when csf was capitalized it did

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,680
identify it as a term when csf was lower

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,720
case

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,000
it left it out now

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,240
one thing that happens

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,919
is a clinical document will be written

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,440
by somebody who wants to yell

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,479
and so everything is in uppercase

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,639
obviously we need to test this

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,840
without further seizure spinal tap and

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,680
culture

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,840
csf seizure spinal tap and

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,880
culture are all uppercase in in

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,840
this sentence they should be

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,000
found however using the lowercase lookup

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,680
table

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
as i spoke of previously the lowercase

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
lookup table

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
is still used as kind of a catch-all and

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
it will

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,400
allow the identification of all these

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
terms even though

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,440
they are all in upper case and not

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,600
in the uppercase lookup table by the way

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,120
so we move forward denies stis

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,240
and abnormal paths now notice that sti

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,720
s is mixed case

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
it does find it you can see so on the

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,919
right

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,080
if you have a lowercase it does not

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,440
because hopefully no one is writing that

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,880
all in lowercase

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,520
same thing for hiv rpi

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,199
r it finds them upper case does not find

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,720
them lowercase

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,080
c b c uppercase not lowercase

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,120
eeg uppercase not lowercase

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,160
so as long as

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,440
the clinical note appropriately has

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
uh acronyms or abbreviations in

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
uppercase

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,319
they should be found if they are in the

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,280
uppercase lookup table

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,280
of the dictionary

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,400
now this is a

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,639
example that has been brought up

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,479
as something that's obvious and

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,280
obviously wrong

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,720
in the previous dictionary lookup there

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,000
is a medication

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,360
named today

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,479
and as you could guess

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,880
today as a word is

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,880
all over various clinical documents and

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,520
we don't want

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
uh for every mention of the word today

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,120
as a

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,560
time you know right now to be

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,440
identified as a medication

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:57,520
so today is actually mixed case

00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,280
in the umls dictionary source

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,800
and so it is put in the mixed case table

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,199
of the dictionary lookup for ctx

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
as we can see in the first sentence the

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,000
patient

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,440
is taking the medication today with a

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,199
capitalized t

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,199
it is identifying today as a medication

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,560
the same thing in the lower case the

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,759
patient is taking

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,639
the medication today it does not

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
identify it

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:30,639
as a medication excellent

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,399
so many problems solved however

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
today the patient is taking the

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,479
medication

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,320
aha today is capitalized because it's at

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,279
the beginning of a sentence

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
and the dictionary look up incorrectly

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,440
identifies it

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,560
as a medication but hey i mean

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,160
what do you want all right so

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,640
runtime customization the default lookup

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,399
request parameters

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,279
for runtime

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,000
performance to be set in two different

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,720
places

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,880
one is a lookup parameter xml file that

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,760
most people can never find

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
and the other is the user environment or

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,200
you know as most people

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,160
currently set it in piper files

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,720
okay the new case sensitive lookup

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,839
allows parameters to be set in one place

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,839
just a piper file

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,480
the xml file that is used by the default

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
dictionary lookup

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,399
is kind of verbose and requires you to

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,600
you know

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,160
self-descriptive as it is uh it

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
has a lot of parameter names and values

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,839
with

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,240
tags etc the

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
piper file that performs the same

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
function

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,279
is not as verbose and i think easier to

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
use

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,640
for someone who is not a software

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
developer

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,160
all right so on the left we can see an

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,839
example

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,360
of the xml file on the right the

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,399
new piper file the

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,480
xml file has a lot of

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,880
tags with keys and values you can see

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,120
them in yellow and white

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,800
and white those are all just labels

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,959
and then you know the gray part that's

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,480
just some

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,480
comments that i have in there

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,320
with this xml file you can set 16

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,440
parameters for the dictionary lookup

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,279
on the right this is a piper file

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,480
everything in gray is either a

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,680
comment or the setting of

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,839
a parameter

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,360
that is not actually required because it

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
has a default

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,240
in the diction in the case sensitive

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,600
dictionary lookout

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,880
everything that looks white right now is

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,240
a setting for customization

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,560
now here you can set not 16 parameters

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
but

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:12,480
25. it's a

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,480
much more customizable dictionary lookup

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,519
alright so here's some snippets from the

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,760
xml file

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,360
again it's self-descriptive however it's

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,760
kind of verbose

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,160
uh to name the dictionaries you know it

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,160
requires four lines

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,560
and specifying that you want a

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:36,000
jdbc dictionary you know you've got this

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,000
really long reference to a java class

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
on the right we have the configuration

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,040
pilot file you just

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,959
set the dictionaries and a name and a

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,399
type on the left again we have concept

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,560
factories

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,839
that's what you actually use to say i

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,880
want an

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,240
rx norm value to be put into my concept

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,320
so i can

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,079
reference it later you have the left and

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
you have the right which is what is in

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,519
the piper file

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
it's a little more brief

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,320
the consumer this uh is what again

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
a lot of people don't even know it

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,560
exists the

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,920
current default dictionary lookup you

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,360
can

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,360
have it provide you with

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,040
everything that's in the document even

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,360
if they have overlapping

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:33,360
spans for instance if the document has

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,480
breast cancer then ctakes will give you

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,680
one concept of breast cancer and then in

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
the same span

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
the concept of cancer even though

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,079
they're you know

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:49,600
the same thing there is a way to

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:53,120
set c takes to use subsumption

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,120
in the default dictionary that's

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
kind of goofy again you have to do it in

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,079
this xml file that nobody even knows

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,440
exists and you have to point to a ctx

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,839
class

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,959
in the new one you just set a

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,839
parameter and the last snippet i'm going

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,600
to show you

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,240
this is actually set by an environment

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
uh setting in the default dictionary

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,880
loop

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,600
cup and it is called exclusion tags

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,360
now uh it was mentioned in another

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,440
presentation that

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
the dictionary lookup will use parts of

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,240
speech to

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,920
validate uh terms

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,440
that it tags as concepts in the

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,639
clinical document now this

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
exclusion tags

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,079
has a list of pen

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,079
tree bank part of speech

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,079
abbreviations

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,560
and unless you look up the pen tree bank

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,320
and see what the list is

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,680
and actually understand syntax

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
then this might not be too easy for you

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,160
to deal with

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,720
if you want to change things

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,480
on the right the new one you just say

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
look up verbs look up nouns look up

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,720
adjectives adverbs

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,160
yes or no uh if you want something that

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
is not one of those

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,380
parts of speech then you can specify the

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,519
pen tree bank

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,839
[Music]

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,839
abbreviation a list of them in other

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
logos

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,240
dictionary creation okay um

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,240
the default dictionary lookup creator

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,880
gui is a little confusing

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,880
the goei panels list umass codes for

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,360
tui's and different source vocabularies

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
without any definition of what they

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,279
really are

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
so if you're not familiar with the umea

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,600
umls

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,000
and semantic types this is really kind

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,279
of

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,320
uh confusing in addition it has lots of

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,160
internal logic

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,240
that is not documented it does a lot of

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
finesse shall we say with what it

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
actually reads in

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,639
from the umls database and what it

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,800
actually stores into the ctas

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,560
database the case-sensitive lookup

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,920
dictionary creator

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:27,199
is an update to this it looks extremely

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,639
similar but the gui panels list

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,759
not only these umls obviously

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,519
codes but also their definitions it

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,880
doesn't have as much

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,959
secret internal logic instead it relies

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,720
a lot more on what the user

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:48,079
selects in the gui alright so

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
here are a few screenshots

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,639
[Music]

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
the first thing you do at the very top

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,560
is select your

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,199
cta's installation directory then your

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,240
umls

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,120
installation directory now everything in

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,120
the table below

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,240
these are

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:14,000
uml's vocabulary abbreviations

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,040
and then next to them their actual

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,720
names their versions and the number of

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,839
kui's that exist in each of them

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,560
in the previous dictionary creator it

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,839
was just

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,480
that column that says code

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,839
so unless you look up all of those

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,240
things individually

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,880
this is a little difficult to make

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,839
you enter your dictionary name and then

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,240
you know

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,120
move on to the next tab which is on the

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,639
right

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,880
and this is semantic types

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,920
the tui which is a code for a semantic

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,000
type then the actual name

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,079
that's easy to understand then the

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,120
semantic group for that for instance

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,839
acquired abnormality is a disorder

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,039
anatomical structure isn't that

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,839
antibiotic is a drug

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
the previous creator just had the column

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,919
that says

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,600
tui and again unless you looked it all

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,400
up

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:22,319
you were kind of in the dark

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,360
types this is new it was not available

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,600
in the default dictionary creator

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,799
um and this is part of what replaces

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,320
all of the secret internal logic that

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
the original creator had

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,360
it kind of chose these for you and did

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,400
some finesse

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,799
performed some you know modification on

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,679
the way that synonyms were stored in the

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,720
database

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,240
without letting you know this allows you

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,000
to

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,919
more intelligently choose what you want

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,200
to put into the

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,200
dictionary database it gives you the

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,960
acronym under the tty you could look

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
that up if you want a lot more

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,600
information

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,080
but to the right it does tell you the

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,160
text type in other words

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:21,760
you know acronym drug product

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:25,840
generic drug name these should be fairly

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,880
useful and self-explanatory

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,799
the last tab is just language these are

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,320
parsed out of your

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,039
like everything else in the previous

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,640
tabs these are parsed out of your

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:42,080
currently installed umls database

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,679
when i installed mine i just had it

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,360
bring in english and it and spanish

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,559
you can also have it bring an italian

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,480
german swiss i think etc and then those

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,960
would be listed here

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,400
i should probably write the name so that

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,080
people know what eng

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,080
and spa actually mean but i'll get to it

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,080
here we go contact some more info write

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,679
questions

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,520
either in this chat window and i'll try

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,039
to address them now or

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:19,440
to the dev uh dev list

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:23,200
or user list go to our website

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,280
and definitely if you have questions the

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,360
fastest way to get an answer might be to

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,120
go to the seats wiki and see if

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,520
anything is on there that can already

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,520
help you

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,840
okay back to

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,320
yes i realized that was a lot of brand

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,679
new

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:15,600
information uh presented in a

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,600
pretty short span of time

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,840
sean can can you hear me yes this is

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
jeff um i have a question while we're

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,480
waiting for you to type um

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
for the uh the the xml versus the piper

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,280
file

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,200
um where there was a slide where you had

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,159
the uh you're comparing the piper file

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,919
to the

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,440
xml file that's generated for each

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,559
dictionary that's created

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,919
right um were you

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
were you saying that um

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,600
were you referring to a separate xml

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,840
file on the previous slide

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,840
or was that always that file

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,120
uh maybe you could go if you're able to

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,840
go back in the slides

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,840
right sure let's see

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:11,440
okay can you see what i'm doing

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,919
yep okay are you referring to this xml

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,440
on the

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,919
left yeah that that's the

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,240
that's is yeah that is not the xml file

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,480
generated by

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,600
is or is it i can't i can't see that

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
text

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,440
yeah it actually is uh

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
okay yes yes i think the one thing that

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,520
i did change

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,919
is if you can see at the very bottom

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,400
that

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:42,080
long string of white that's the

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
class specification for

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,080
uh what's what perform subsumption

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,600
okay so i guess what you're so what you

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,360
were saying is that for example right

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,280
now i believe exclusion tags

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,799
you can't set that in the default xml

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,159
file you can only set it in the piper

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,240
file as far as i understand and you're

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,000
saying you kind of followed that forward

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,159
for new configuration items as well

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,159
for the new one exactly okay

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,039
yeah and i as you can see here i

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,840
tried to really simplify it for people

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,840
that aren't

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:31,200
familiar with the jargon shall we say

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,200
does anyone else have questions

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:43,520
i'm kind of surprised by the silence

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,919
this is a big change

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,440
and oh by change i do not mean that this

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,400
is the default this is an

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,400
optional uh dictionary lookup

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,440
i have another question i'll ask sure

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,880
um speed wise is this compe is this

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
similar in speed to the

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,520
to the default i mean i imagine it's i

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,120
imagine it's a little bit slower

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,080
it's actually uh from what i've tested

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,720
it's not any slower and part of the

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,480
reason

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,480
is i think that

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,200
even though things are split into three

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,280
tables there isn't much

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,720
overlap between the tables okay

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,280
there's a question about where the code

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,559
is currently ah the code is in

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:37,120
trunk i do want to release it with

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:39,360
ctx5 but again it will not be the

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,600
default lookup

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,440
however i think it is a very useful

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,640
option to have around

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,400
so if you're familiar with the

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,159
everyone out there if you're familiar

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,360
with the ctake's

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,159
subversion or svn repository you can

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,200
find it there

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,840
it's part of the ctakes dictionary

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,520
lookup

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,200
fast module i did not give it its own

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,960
module um

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,320
for various reasons that i'm not going

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,480
to get into now

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:16,720
but if you are not familiar with how to

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,080
uh reach the svn repository

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,880
go to ctax.apache.org

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,880
and there is a downloads page and the

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,200
link to that repository

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,200
is in the lower right i believe

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,279
uh there's a request if you could post

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,039
if you could post this on the

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
user endeavor list the code the path to

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:41,600
the code

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,630
yes i can do that yeah i would like to

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,520
uh when we move into

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:49,200
[Music]

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,400
say putting together a release candidate

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,559
for c takes five i want to you know

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,520
put together a list of all of the new

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,880
things

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,760
uh that not only need to be publicized

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:06,240
for ctx 5 but also need to be

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,240
tested documented what have you

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,760
great there's a

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,080
comment that we should probably have a

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,520
module for doing ner evals and some

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,039
standard data sets that's easy for

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,000
people to test out new innovations like

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:21,360
this

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,240
from timothy miller yes we definitely

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,760
should we have

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,240
um in fact

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,279
i think what we could do is put

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,080
something in

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,880
examples and use the example notes that

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,200
exist in c

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,200
takes

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,520
so i when this comes out you

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
is is it would it be possible to use the

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,960
new gui to create an old dictionary or

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,039
are they going to be separate

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,440
they're separate and the old gui still

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,159
exists

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,440
like i said i've not done a full you

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,360
know replacement

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,360
uh this is just a new option

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,600
are there any other comments or

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,600
questions

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,279
i know just from the comments that i see

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,039
on the message board that

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,080
this should come in handy um but

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,919
yeah i hope so i mean you're correct

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,919
there's been a lot of discussion on

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,440
uh case sensitivity and problems with

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,840
the current dictionary

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,679
i know that you've been uh pretty active

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,360
in those discussions

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,400
um so there was really a

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,799
lot of impetus for me to do this and get

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,159
it done

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,799
sooner rather than later yeah i think

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,240
the um

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,080
the more trans to google with more

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,320
transparency um it's great

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,279
a couple more questions here concerning

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,039
source control

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,039
do we have plans to switch to github

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,520
all right uh that's a really good

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,919
question um

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,799
apache does have a mirror a github

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,480
repository that is a mirror of the

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,850
subversion repository

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,840
however um

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,480
[Music]

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,679
updating has not been very frequent for

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,840
one reason or another

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:20,159
and the biggest problem that we have

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:24,080
with the github um

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:27,440
kind of uh standard mode of operation

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,480
is that github really wants you to put

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,080
in

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,960
text because as you can imagine it makes

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,480
modification

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
easier it only has to keep track of the

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,520
modifications not an entirely new file

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,360
so there is a size limit on

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,640
files that are binary

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,440
our machine learning training model

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,039
files

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,559
are by and large binary and

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,200
a good number of them are

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,960
in size they are past the limit of what

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,080
github allows

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,080
so uh

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,279
we've had a lot of problems trying to

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,039
get them in and

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,559
and when there's a change trying to get

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,559
the change in and approved

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,440
however what i think would be nice

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,720
is if we had we kept the models on

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,720
subversion

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,399
uh and we could somehow put the rest of

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,000
the code

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,840
on a github mirror and you could either

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,679
you know use github and then check out

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,720
the models on subversion or

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,520
and this is you know the more useful

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,000
thing

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,799
uh you could you know check out ctags on

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,720
github

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,200
and then or the code and then when you

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,960
build it maven is going to bring down

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,760
those models for you anyhow

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,840
someone's suggesting one of the get

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,960
large file system for large models

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,000
um yeah there are

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,159
i guess there are there are ways of um

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,919
pointing to other storage for larger

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,559
files one of the one of the

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,440
if if we switch to git will it uh github

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,559
will we would

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:11,760
would that replace the email

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,960
with um issues or some

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,000
or would you still have the same um

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,880
dev user and oh

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
uh yeah i see what you're saying if

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,399
that's a good question

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,080
i mean we would still have the devon

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,039
user lists

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,760
uh we would still have bug tracking

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,000
through

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,399
uh whatever we use right now i can't

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,399
remember

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,640
but i don't know if we would have to set

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,159
up the github repo

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,399
to either forward bugs and

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:50,240
comments or turn them off completely

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:53,520
i'm not a github expert

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,559
there's a suggestion to use the i2b2 or

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,679
n2c2 for medication

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,799
medication um i'm not

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,799
i'm not physology ner is that pathology

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,320
i've seen several tools measure their f

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,399
scores over those data i think this is

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,240
in reference to um perhaps this is in

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,720
reference to uh

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,840
doing some ner evals on standard data

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,360
data sets

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:21,360
right uh actually we have done

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,720
evals using sharp and share data sets

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,960
which come from challenges i2 b2

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,520
um i don't think we've actually used

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,679
anything

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,880
for comparison or testing however i

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,240
should state that

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,200
i2b2 for a bunch of the projects they

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,320
actually use c takes and the c takes

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,720
dictionary lookup

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,880
so you know they must trust it a little

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,880
bit

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
uh

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,760
yes uh peter says that

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,279
yuma moved almost to completely to

00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
github but jira and my english did the

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,000
same

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,279
uh gorgana i've been pronouncing your

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
name correctly

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
um yes we have a number of gold

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,440
annotation data sets that we use

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,279
um semival share some eval and clinical

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,279
tempo

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,000
um i've noticed one of the reasons i had

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,960
asked

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,240
about the the forums is because i

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,200
sometimes have difficulty

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,399
searching them or sharing sharing things

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,159
the way that i would like them to be

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,080
to sort of be visualized to other users

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,840
and i was wondering if a switch to

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,760
github would

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,679
um or or maybe another system would

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,679
would help other folks as well

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,279
people people sometimes they post links

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,320
to it things thinking that

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,279
it's being rendered but it's not right

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,120
yeah actually i feel your pain searching

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,799
the dev list

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,880
or for things that have been mentioned

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,559
in the dev list is not only painful but

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,320
once you do find a thread

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,320
it can be extremely hard to read

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,760
it would be nice to have something like

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,600
uh you know the github paradigm of you

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,880
know throwing everything into a little

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,480
box and a gui on the web

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
we're gonna ask what is the apache

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,840
software foundation policy on switching

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
to github

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,120
i don't know uh i've

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,640
honestly i've always been happy with

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,360
subversion and our current

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,420
you know primary repository so i haven't

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,720
looked into this at all

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,360
[Music]

00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,680
but i believe that there's a question

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,789
that anyone could write to

00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,789
[Music]

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
forget what they're called basically

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,640
apache infrastructure

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
and you know pose the question write

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,720
some comments

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,960
um state you know your affiliation with

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,480
c

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,159
takes what have you and uh you know

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,159
i think anyone could research this

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,880
peter says that only the source moved

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,159
there many apache software foundation

00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,840
projects moved their main code

00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,840
development to github

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,840
ah okay and this is in reference to uh

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,880
yuma um ruda and

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:28,320
bug tracking correct

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,000
i peter his follow-up comment said that

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,760
so it's okay and officially supported by

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,799
apache that's what peter's

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,799
uh statement was right peter

00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:43,440
klugel and peter uh abramowitz

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,760
on github would be nice for peer review

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,559
uh or and he asked whether subversion

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,679
has a similar process

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,679
uh yeah i don't know of a way to do it

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,159
i'm subversion what i've always done is

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,120
go

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,640
to the uh you know someone post

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,640
something

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,399
in and i can't remember what our bug

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,039
tracker is right now

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,399
uh you know i've ended up downloading it

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,159
and then you know

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,159
manually going through the steps of

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,560
putting it in there

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,000
branches and pull requests and

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,599
everything else that

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,800
github and you know underlying it get

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,919
can do for you they really are great i

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,040
do use github

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,440
and get on other projects and i i do

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,480
enjoy it

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,960
i just don't know what capabilities

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,839
would

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,839
you know pull in from github

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,760
i don't know i'm i'm actually friends

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,440
with one of the managers that could help

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,119
i could

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,119
could always see if i could pull strings

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
but

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,480
are there any other questions

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,839
okay

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,650
well i think this is the last ctek's

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,839
presentation of the day

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,560
[Music]

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,480
um

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
i am certainly willing to stay on the

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,200
line

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:31,839
and answer questions until they are

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,839
no longer asked

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,599
sean there's a this is a question that i

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,560
have again

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,079
it's kind of going back to the first

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,880
question i had since no one else is

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,599
asking is

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,280
a little bit off topic but um there is

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,400
another xml file

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,640
that that is sometimes used

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,480
to set settings for for annotation

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,320
engines correct

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,810
um like the abstract oh yes

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,800
it's a larger file

00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,359
[Music]

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,880
sorry go ahead are you talking about the

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,000
descriptor files that

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,760
uh are at a higher level

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,520
used to set up the pipeline itself and

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,040
all of the annotators that are within

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,760
the pipeline i

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,119
i think there's an xml file that

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,520
describes

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,640
like some of the default settings um

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,760
for example the default settings right

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,280
now wherever this

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,359
wherever the default setting right now

00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,880
is that says what the exclusion tags are

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:48,720
i feel like that is in another xml file

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:54,400
right that that is in a descriptor file

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,560
which um are kind of

00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
they're an old i'm i'm going to say

00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,839
older i think there's still a standard

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,599
for some people

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,720
but um they're an older method of

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,960
setting up

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:12,400
pipelines for ctas and

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,200
i never really liked them

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,520
because i can't stand trying to find

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,280
things in a series of xml files

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,200
and then you know trying to run through

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,000
and make sure all my parameters are said

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,240
and the

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,480
formatting hasn't you know messed up

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,839
anything etc

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,880
so i am a convert i use

00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,800
piper files now which

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,200
pretty much completely replace the

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,800
descriptor files

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,800
and they're you know i think you can

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:51,200
still see it on the screen

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:54,160
what is on the right

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,720
and there there is a page on the c-takes

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,240
wiki

00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,440
about piper files uh there are actually

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,720
newer capabilities in pipers now

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,920
um you can add various views

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,440
um and a couple other things i i think

00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,800
but so there will have to be a new

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,079
wiki entry for ctx5

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,359
right well that seems like

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,000
it um for questions at least for this

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,599
session

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,599
thank you sean thank you for moderating

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,280
yeah there is one more question um about

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,400
if the slides will be available

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,520
after publication so

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,560
i am going to put the slides

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,560
on the ctek's website uh

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,640
i don't think the slides themselves will

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,800
be available through

00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,200
apache or apache con the presentations

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,720
as they have been recorded are supposed

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,720
to be available and i think there will

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,440
be youtube versions so

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,760
uh that should be easy to find but i

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,640
will put the actual powerpoint slides

00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,640
uh on the back on the cta's website

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,359
all right thank you all right thank all

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,079
the attendees

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,400
uh it's really good to have questions

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,119
and

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,079
comments and useful discussion

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,839
especially this

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
github stuff i have learned a lot

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:29,839
okay bye all

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,560
