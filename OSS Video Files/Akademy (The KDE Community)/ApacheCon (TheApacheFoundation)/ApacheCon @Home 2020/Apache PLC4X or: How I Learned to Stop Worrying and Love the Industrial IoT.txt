	Apache PLC4X or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Industrial IoT
Julian Feinauer

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The Apache PLC4X project left the incubator last year and is one of the younger projets of the ASF. It is a set of libraries for communicating with industrial programmable logic controllers (PLCs) using a variety of protocols but with a shared API. At pragmatic minds we had the first (known) productive deployments of PLC4X in industrial projects. As many may know, there still is a gap between the very IT affine Open Source world and the OT or shop floor world in the industry. So, at the beginning, these projects sometimes felt like Alices adventures when she fell down the rabbit hole. During these projects we entered a world that is completely different, sometimes strange but very exciting.

Julian Feinauer studied mathematics at the university of Stuttgart and received his PhD in mathematics at Ulm University. Besides his interest in open source and big data he had many contacts with timeseries data, storage and evaluation. In 2016 he founded the company pragmatic industries GmbH with focus on industrial iot and industry data processing.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,039
um

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,199
hi and very warm welcome from my side

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
let me trust me a bit uh very well

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,640
welcome from eyesight

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,600
to my talk apache plc for xor how

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,520
i learned to stop boring and love the

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,760
industrial iot

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
for everybody who was in the previous

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,239
talk or session from

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,399
chris learned a lot of uh

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,719
details and if you if you saw on

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,280
apachecon last year probably

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
we talked a lot about details of ps4x

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
and how it works and

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,840
why it is so cool and today this talk

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,400
is not so much about details but more

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,720
about the application

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,040
psc forex kind of opened up a new

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,080
way new possibilities for applications

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,200
would we

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,640
as um i.t

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,119
people never did in that way before um

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,840
so today i want to talk a bit about what

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,080
we learned during this way

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,600
and what you probably will learn if you

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
start with some kind of industriality

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,940
projects

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,110
using plc forex

00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,110
[Music]

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,799
so um

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,520
who am i um some people

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,720
may know me my name is julian from

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,680
germany

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,360
i'm pretty involved with the asf

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,880
one of the first projects i joined was

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
the ps4x project

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,600
actively joint um and i'm active in the

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
iot and our industrial iot area how i

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
would call it

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,280
and i like databases um

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,879
as you can see so these these are

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,760
projects i'm really

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,480
involved in or trying to contribute as

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
good as possible

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,120
okay um so coming back to the topic of

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
my talk

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,080
um here are two things

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
two components i want to talk about in

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,879
this talk

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,040
and the first one is apache plc4x um

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,480
whoever for all the people that were

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,280
already in the in the previous session

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
from just

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,959
they may know what plc forex is but i

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,560
just want to quickly sum it

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,800
up again basically it is

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,160
a collection of uh of libraries

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,000
to communicate with pfcs

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,080
for two reasons or two things are i

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,800
would say rather new compared to all

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,720
existing solutions one thing is that

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,080
there is something open source or with a

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,800
business friendly open source

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
license to talk to plc's and the second

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,120
thing

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,640
is that you have one common api which is

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
something pretty powerful

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,800
um i mean it's totally obvious in the

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,159
database where nobody could live without

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,280
something like jdbc

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,959
because we need to reason at a bit of

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,920
time about what database your client

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,680
probably wants to use

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,599
and then this is something which is

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,480
totally uh totally

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,799
standard in the industry it is someone

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
which

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,799
annoyed us and therefore we we tried to

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,200
design

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:44,799
a pc fix after that model basically

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,000
so here's a very very quick overview

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
chart so basically you

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,680
write your application or we have some

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,360
default integrations of email

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,400
applications

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,680
which all go to the plc forex api and

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,080
underneath the api there are

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
different drivers and there's some kind

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
of driver discovery

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,879
which works pretty similar to how jdbc

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,840
works

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,159
so that application programmers should

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,200
not

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,400
know too much about the plc is used or

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
involved

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,479
they should just know the connection

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,199
strings basically

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,400
um and this is proved to be a good

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,479
concept in a database world odbc jdbc

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,440
and this also is quite nice here

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,400
so coming back to my initial slide where

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,600
you know

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,520
what apache pl6 forex is basically

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,960
brings us to advantages common api and

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,360
it's open source

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
um but the second thing i want to talk

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,479
about

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,400
in this talk is industrial iot

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
so you might ask i mean all of you know

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
iot

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,520
internal things yeah but why is there

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,039
such a term as industrial iot i mean

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,160
what is different in industriality than

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,800
regular iot applications why

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,440
why is there even separate terms for it

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,520
i mean

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
there are tons of iot applications and

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,560
not every application gets it to terms

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,440
like internet of health application or

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
internet of

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,880
mobile things or whatever only the

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,479
industry gets one

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,600
on special term iiot why is that

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,400
i mean why don't we we take a page out

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,479
of our

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,160
internet or things book and look at one

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,680
of those

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
well-known well established applications

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,880
that are out there for i don't know

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,759
all those things that are out there that

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
are connected sending data to the cloud

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,320
um

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
chris just showed us a pretty nice home

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,280
automation home automation

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,800
uh talk and i mean there's

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,280
there's a lot of technology out there

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
and many people know how to do it with

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,240
the right tools

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
so what what is the thing here that

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,560
makes

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,400
industriality a bit a bit different

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,720
than regularity and when

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,840
i talk about the journey we did i

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,680
sometimes refer to alice some of you may

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,340
know the book

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,880
i like the book

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,319
[Music]

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,520
and when we started our journey

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,160
to to uh the shop floors of this world

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,840
to guard a date had to do analysis on it

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,840
um we were of a in a

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,039
great perspective we were a bit like

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
alice um

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,479
sitting in front of this rabbit hole

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
considering if

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,600
she should jump in or not then she

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,759
decided to jump in and this is basically

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,039
what we did um so who are

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,199
elsa's this picture is me is us it's

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
also you that because you will join me

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,240
now in this trailer through the

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,319
rabbit hole and what is the rabbit hole

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
the rabbit hole is uh

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,720
trying to do it stuff or even open

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,240
source stuff

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,319
in the industry in the traditional

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,400
industry

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,199
which is a pretty crazy thing overall

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,080
and i want to take you with me on this

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
journey

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,919
and just tell you some of the findings

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,599
we had probably

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,000
some some short success rules

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,960
or some learnings at least we had we're

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,120
not finished yet

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,039
we will still learn a lot of things but

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,840
but i can tell you at least

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,240
two or three years of experience in the

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,759
field

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,000
so the first thing we are seeing here

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
by the way you see a lot of movie quotes

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,199
here the first

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,160
thing we are seeing here is not it but

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,199
it's ot

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,560
ot some of you may know what

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,960
ot is and some of you may not ot at

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
least

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,000
is not id and the first and biggest or

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,599
big mistake you can do is to think that

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
ot is like id but just something

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,400
different

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,680
and for all of you who don't know ot um

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,720
algorithms like what is ot ot stands for

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,240
uh operational technology which is

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:16,639
kind of a term which

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,240
emerged as an alternative to

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,520
iv for information technology and ots

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
sorry have to look on the other side

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,479
because everything is

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:32,320
is basically mirrored in front of me

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,640
is ot is about industrial equipment

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,839
um and this especially means the

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,440
difference to the

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,599
traditional i.t systems world and

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,039
um there's also this nice term the

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,560
quotas from wikipedia

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,920
which is i.t in the non-carpet

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,600
areas or non-carpeted areas

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,200
and there's some truth in this statement

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,560
because this is also a bit

00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,080
sometimes like the ot guys see us id

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,720
guys living in a comfortable

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,600
world where perfume is nice and carpeted

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,560
and they are the rough world of

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,080
machinery so this this is something

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,800
which we will meet again later just a

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,600
minute but just

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,000
to keep this in the background uh in the

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,279
back of your head

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,640
so what is uh ot about lt

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,959
is not about pcs i would say but it's

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,880
about plc's we will come to that

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,680
later it's about scada systems about

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,959
cnc's

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
um about you know coming with the chris

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,040
about

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,279
building management systems um

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,240
lightning controlled energy monitorings

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,519
and one

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,240
last thing slow down for a second

00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,279
transportation systems

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,720
built for uh

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,279
the built environment

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,080
no we will not do apache vms i think i

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,920
probably

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,880
if lucas is here in the talk he might be

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,519
interested in something like that

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,200
okay so this is what ot is about not

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,920
about

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,360
some of the pc's sitting there uh being

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
used for production

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
purposes um

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
so now that was the theorem plc and the

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,600
term plc is pretty

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
central for plc forex of course

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,160
difference in the name

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,000
and what is a plc a plc you can look it

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,440
up as a

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,440
programmable logic controller

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,839
so it's something you can program of

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,800
course which can work on some kind of

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,720
logic

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
and which is a controller which controls

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
things useful

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,399
usually it's a heart of a machine that

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,640
controls motors

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,519
and yeah all kind of other stuff and

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,079
you may be tempted to think of it being

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,720
a small computer because it has a cpu in

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
it so

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,399
of course it's a small computer

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
but it's not not really that true i mean

00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
there are

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,079
several things that a plc is really

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,279
really

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,200
really good at one thing is that being

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,480
programmable i mean of course a

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,519
non-profit plc would be

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,600
weird at least but also at

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,640
controlling systems so they have fixed

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,200
cycle times

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
they are so robust that they live for 20

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
years without

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
interruptions um but there are some

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
things

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
which a plc is not so good at and

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,399
basically

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,160
it's everything else so

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,920
it's it has very few computational power

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,120
every mobile phone and probably even the

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,399
old nokia phones we grew up with

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,120
have uh more power

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,680
very small program memory you may not

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
remember that

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,200
some of you may remember the times when

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,320
you really had to be careful

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,839
uh if your program doesn't get too big

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
to be able to to bring it on your

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,480
embedded device

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
very few memory uh ram memory

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
and things like connectivity this

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
what is connectivity at the shop floor

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,959
level

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,959
the plc sits there

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,040
so um this is basically a plc and this

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
is the main thing we're talking with and

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,440
it's

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
no computer although it has a cpu it's

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,519
no computer and this is an important

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,760
thing

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,839
to note well i don't know if it runs

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,800
around stupid i mean it should be able

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,800
to i don't know if

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,240
someone ever did that um

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,519
okay so there we are

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
we are the id guys on the under i don't

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
know from your perspective it's the left

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,120
side that the

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,639
the nerdy guys um

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,360
um sitting around having nice ideas what

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,279
to do

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,399
and then there's the other guys on the

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,760
other side of this

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,959
nice river

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,040
and what plc

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,279
forex does so basically it did and was

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,760
why we joined the project is

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,800
um it built the bridge

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,360
build the bridge from i t to other way

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,399
around

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,000
it doesn't matter what so before there

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
was

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
all the problems i will tell you about

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
now and the rest of my talk didn't exist

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,399
because

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,200
there was no branch so nobody invaded

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,120
the other the other side and nobody

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,279
well had issues with this side um

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,959
but as plc forex builds the pressure

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,760
probably another nice statement would be

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,959
open to

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,760
the pandora's box

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,959
lots of problems occurred so really an

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,959
important thing

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:46,720
for all of us from the i.t side is to

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,760
to uh realize that

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,680
psc4x only solves the physical

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,079
connectivity problem

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,440
just allows us to go over to the other

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,800
side but

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,440
by the other side is a bit different on

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,160
our side here

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
i will bring you some examples that that

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
we

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,040
in one and the other way uh uh yeah head

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,320
like this

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,079
um we were talking with clients and they

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,120
said uh we have these issues and

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,120
it was quite obvious that um using some

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,000
kind of machine data you could be able

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
to help them

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,560
at machines were not even that old they

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,839
were 10 years old which is not that old

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,839
i mean the machines out there which are

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,320
30 years old so 10 years is

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,800
quite nice what kind of computer did we

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,600
have 10 years ago

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,320
or basically the same as we had today i

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,040
guess

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,880
and we said okay then let's go and we

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,240
had to leave this plc for x thing so

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,000
we are totally ready um then the next

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,240
thing they said was like

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,279
um okay here's the air is

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,399
too free to connect where's your part

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,800
and we were like whoa and

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,079
i mean probably some of the younger

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,680
colleagues or listeners may not even

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
know what this is

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,399
this is a thing which was pretty big

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,360
back then we used it to plug in our

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,360
joysticks sometimes

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:16,399
so our obvious reaction was

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,279
okay what what are we doing here um

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,760
i probably have to uh so as i found a

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:26,399
bit again

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,199
stealing my slides to show um

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,399
yeah exactly to play mobile games uh i

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,440
don't know what the thing was originally

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
invented for

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,120
so uh these are situations

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,399
that happen today after the day you go

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,360
to a factory then

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,959
this is a conversation that could

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,959
totally happen there um

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,720
i had a situation where we said okay

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,680
now we we said okay let's focus on some

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,759
something which is uh

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
ethernet based at least where you have

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,959
this kind of block going in the thing do

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,560
you have it and it's like yeah okay the

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,079
new machine over there has it

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,920
and then we went over to the new machine

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,240
over there and said okay nice

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,519
uh we can we can connect the thing

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,120
just tells the ip and those guys were

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,160
like

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
what do you mean it's this machine right

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,959
in front of you

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,880
and we were like yeah yeah we know but

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,639
what's up you know

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,839
this machine here um and this is

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,759
just an example um

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:33,440
which is here to show you

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,600
that it's not only

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
the physical layer but but there's more

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,519
to it

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,079
i mean we can't do the connectivity but

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,360
but

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,480
iit and ot still

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,639
um are different that there are

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,240
differences and i want to to

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,360
show you some of the of the difficult

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,199
difficulties uh

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,480
we saw there one thing is the cultural

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,919
uh the cultural differences so

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,120
um things like i mean for us

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,760
for all of us here it's certainly

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,280
obvious certain ips and on mac address

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,600
but for some people working in the

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,839
industry i mean they never use that

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,679
thing

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,520
and although the ot guys

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,039
they just know how to keep their stuff

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,919
running and

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,880
um they're very very infrequent changes

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
in the network

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
so they also don't use dhcp or something

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,400
um

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,840
and there are cultural differences

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
things which are totally common for us

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
and if you if i mean if i would ask here

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,799
and do a poll like

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,120
do you know what an ips everybody would

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,320
be like ah is he dumb or what

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,640
um but if you go there i mean it's just

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,960
not

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,799
uncommon knowledge the same uncommon

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
knowledge if i would ask you

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,559
uh if you know what profibus is and you

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,120
would be like what profibus

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,240
i don't know probably a bus for

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,799
professionals

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,240
um and those guys are like yeah that's

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,720
the mostly used

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,080
protocol how can you not know profibus

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
um

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
so yeah there's a cultural difference um

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,799
which we have to admit

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,960
and not everybody is as it fluent as we

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,960
are

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,520
next thing is we don't speak the same

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,960
language

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
there are some things which are totally

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,000
common knowledge of

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,600
us and which we think is totally obvious

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,280
like ethernet

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,640
iop all that stuff and they don't

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,799
um understand what we mean and vice

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,160
versa

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,520
and i mean many examples

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,280
but one example i prepared some example

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
one example i can give you

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,640
programming we already do programming of

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
course we do programming

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,919
so what is programming well of course

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,200
it's having your

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,400
ide open some kind of code git or

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,960
well as we ended in very rare cases um

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,679
so the left side the iss programming and

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440
they're like

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,840
oh what are you doing they are writing a

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,600
novel this is programming

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,160
and what you see here something called a

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,799
letter diagram and this is how plcs are

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,240
programmed

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,480
i mean there are some ways to broker

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
this also with what they call structured

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
text which is

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,200
something quite new in area but usually

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,720
they use this kind of letter diagram

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,240
which represents uh electric

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,320
circuits um

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,679
like this is what they mean if they say

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,520
programming so if they would say

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,280
oh i can give you the plc broker if it

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,919
helps you it's like yes yes because

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
you know all those languages and you're

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,960
like

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,880
well but this is not programming this is

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,000
drawing

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,120
um but this is this is one example for

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,120
for

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,640
the different different words and

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,840
different technology

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,960
and another another thing which is which

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,520
is even nicer is

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,039
important some things are important and

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,320
what is important for us

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,000
oh there's a major bug this is important

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,840
of course we have to fix it

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,480
and those guys don't feel anything at a

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,880
mixture pack those guys

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,640
those guys start to getting pulse when

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
there's something burning in the factory

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,799
this is important but not something in a

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,640
computer

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,640
these guys are from the real world and

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,240
that's this and now we can can go back

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,039
up to the to the example of the

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,720
with the carpeted area and this is how

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
sometimes they see the world i mean they

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,440
have

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,320
issues they have tons of steel standing

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,679
they're

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:37,039
crashing being loud noisy all that stuff

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,360
um and we have like okay

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,240
there's a bug when someone enters

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,159
something dumb

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,360
the program does something dumb it is a

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,640
bit out they see us

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,919
um sometimes so so um

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,559
yeah there could be numbers more

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,440
examples of what can go from

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,480
wrong when talking to these guys but but

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,200
this is

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,840
just another example the the thing we

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,880
have to

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,600
understand is in a factory

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,720
there's usually one main goal and this

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,440
is to produce

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
some kind of a product or parse and ship

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,320
them out

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,080
this is what matters nothing else

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,799
matters everything else in the factory

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,240
is there

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,679
to support this process producing parts

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,360
and shipping them out everything else is

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,559
yeah it's a nice add-on so so

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,919
if they think about software or

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,360
something this is something which helps

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,280
them helps them do their process but

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,440
nobody cares about the software itself

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:39,360
and even less than than in regular id

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,600
and if the computer stops working

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,000
then they will just continue production

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,159
and then

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
don't do anything for documentation or

00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,280
something because

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
that's the one metric they are looking

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,760
at every day is

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,919
how many parts did we produce uh

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,960
which cycle times did we have all those

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
things

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,080
and if you say something like yeah but

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,039
the computer crashed so we had to and

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
they like

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,960
totally what computer you you paid to

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,039
produce parts not to

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,760
look at the computer and

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,640
this is really might say this is what

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,039
they're coming from

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,840
and uh this also um

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,600
yes has some kind of thriff in it of

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,520
course we're always seeing the ideas

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,120
but those guys are seeing the other side

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,159
those guys are seeing

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,159
production or not production so

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,960
important for them is something totally

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,240
different than for us

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,120
so coming back to one of the original

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,559
flight after

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,600
um yeah showing you

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,200
some of the the things we

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,640
we observed are some of the uh things we

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,640
we realized during this this work i i

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,200
initially said that the talk

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,919
indicates at least that we have some

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,480
kind of

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,480
knowledge on how to be more successful

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,720
with industrial iot products

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,600
now than we were three years ago and

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,760
that's

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,039
totally true and

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,280
so i collected some pinpoints

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:18,960
or yeah learnings or whatever

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,360
um to to

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,280
be more successful when you want to

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,880
start an industriality project

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,360
project or when you think about

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,720
solutions for industriality basically

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,799
just look me at myself again

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,520
it's more personal like that of course

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,640
so uh

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,159
yeah and what nick states there is

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,559
totally true i mean that's the only

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,960
thing

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,320
which is interesting for them how many

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
parts produce

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,080
if you produce enough powers money is

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,080
fine if not

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,760
so one thing of course we hear the

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,559
apache con and the talk

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,400
is named something with pc fix of course

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,960
one rule to be successful is to use

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,240
open source they're totally obvious for

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,679
us of course

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
but there's some truth in it and

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
you can you can come across some weird

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,159
situation that we had

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,559
even the issues that we had in some

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,640
protocols like opcoa which is

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:18,799
um which which is an open specification

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,240
but there was an issue

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,159
um but there was an issue

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,600
with an implementation inside the plc

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,400
because the pro because the

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,159
the project is still pretty new or the

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,279
protocol circuit he knew

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,159
so we had to redraw fit basically this

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
back in

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,200
our library to be able to communicate

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,120
with this plc because remember

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,120
nobody cares about why something is not

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,240
working with your

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,039
corporate area pc thing because the pc

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,400
is always right

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,559
of course the pc is running there so

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
it's ten years so and you are there

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,400
since

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,120
two hours so of course the psc is right

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,200
right

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,240
um so this helped us a lot to

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,919
to uh do fast release cycles and it's

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,640
not in the pc first community that we're

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,799
usually

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,039
uh i don't know it takes one week after

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,039
the new release until we are on our own

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,559
ford release where we already have the

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,600
newest fixes

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,320
in there or yes findings

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,120
so for us it's really important to be

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,390
able to

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,279
use plc forks like that

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:26,720
[Music]

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:30,159
and next learning is

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,799
plcs are not just

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,919
computers in different housings i

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,200
already

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,559
talked a bit about it but but really

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,679
plc's are not just computers

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,880
another situation we observed what

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,159
we observed frequently is a plc expose

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,720
some kind of server for some kind of

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,320
protocol

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,159
so you can think about it like rest

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,919
which which is obviously wrong but this

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,679
is how your initially would think oh

00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,720
yeah it's just a server so i can just

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,840
query it

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,840
yeah of course you can just query but

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
i initially said usually they have fixed

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,760
cycle times of 10 milliseconds or 20

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,080
milliseconds

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,200
which are very important that uh data

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,919
are held otherwise

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,159
they doing a full stop because usually

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,200
they start some kind of motor which runs

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,000
10 tons of steel somewhere and they are

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
certain

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,279
that in the next 20 milliseconds they

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
are back to check

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,080
if it's already close to the wall and

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,640
stop it or not

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,320
so this is really crucial second time

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,720
but

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,080
if you send too many requests to the plc

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,120
because you think like uh it's just a

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
rest thing i'm just

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,720
asking asking nothing then it could

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,279
happen that the plc

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,080
slows down the cycle that much that it

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,919
goes to an emergency stop

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,400
because when those things were built

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,279
nobody thought about the case where

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,559
someone with a

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,080
regular pc just sends thousands requests

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,919
a second

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,080
because that's nothing you would do in

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,600
an industrial setup

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,159
and this was a big learning for us

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,840
because we just said okay let's just

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,880
do a loop and ask this thing things and

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,240
but but really terrible things could be

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,080
could be happening the worst thing would

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
be some kind of accent or crash

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,200
but the second bursting would be a stop

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,960
of the machine because when the machine

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,480
stops in a production

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,480
that's always pretty bad

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,240
and

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,399
another lesson be pragmatic i mean

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,039
we are pragmatic minds so we are always

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:41,360
preventing by definition basically but

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:43,279
um simple things are more robust than

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,520
complex things so if there's a simple

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,240
way to do it then do it because

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,480
things will terribly go wrong always and

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,520
usually when they go wrong this

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,200
yeah something something bad happens so

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,120
it's really important to be pragmatic

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,960
and to to really think about

00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:04,559
can you do it even simpler probably um

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,240
and something to those guys always

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:12,000
do or always also reasonable

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,799
and be ready for adventures

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,399
because i mean we had no project which

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,679
ended the way we thought it would when

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,880
we started it

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,039
because i mean we have a lot of this

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,799
waterfall versus epsilon but those guys

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,320
usually are always agile

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,480
doing everything on the job if someone

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,080
comes in and they plug in the stuff then

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,520
they think about okay what do you

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,320
what to do next i'm not saying they are

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,360
chaotic but that's usually the way they

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,200
are building their stuff

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,559
do one step the next step the next at

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,480
the next step and there's no one

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,960
coming with an architecture diagram of

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,520
okay this this is how the

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,399
how we should set up this this extension

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,440
that thing

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,679
so um usually those those

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,880
projects evolve and another fact may be

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,559
that we're opening up

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
lots of new possibilities that nobody

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,440
fought about so

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,600
when we're showing the data they're like

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,559
oh cool now we could also do

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,679
this and that with the data um and

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,720
you're like yeah of course

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,960
so so you really should be ready for

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,240
for adventures so first thing is of

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,840
course your mindset and second thing

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
also probably in your architecture

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,840
so um

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,480
ss yeah we're coming closer to the end

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,919
of my talk

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,039
so the very very short summary

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,760
probably of what i can say you when

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,039
doing this

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
it ot projects or industrial iot how we

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,360
call it

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:44,640
is it's about programming on technology

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,320
and mindset even more than is

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,159
with regularity projects because in

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,320
regular id projects

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,919
there is usually some kind of common

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,360
sense there are usually

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,640
everybody has same expectations uh

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,120
knows what what we're talking about

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,120
knows

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:07,039
the limits of technology and what not

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,120
um and

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,320
in these projects as two words come

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,679
together which

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,679
which are really uh yeah from have two

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,399
totally different perspectives cultures

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,640
histories um you really have to be

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,760
prepared to have an open mindset

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,320
to and very simple things like

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,440
don't think they are done just because

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,480
they don't

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
know what the ip is or they still use

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,919
aries232

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
that's not because they're dumb i mean

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,799
it's just because their job is something

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
totally different

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,919
keeping a machine running and not caring

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,360
about

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:45,279
cables computers protocols new

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,039
if the old stuff runs then keep it

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,039
running there are machines out there

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,880
running still on doors

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,039
why should you do an update it works and

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,279
it's air kept so what

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,880
um so mindset is really really i mean

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,840
those people i think have some

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,720
experience with it guys or consultants

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,080
coming in there from their carpeted

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,880
floors down to

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,559
to the production and telling them oh we

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,640
know how to do your job better

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:15,440
and they all failed of course because

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,640
it's a tough job they have

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,880
and therefore i would say it's it's

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,880
way more important than other projects

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,320
to to have the right mindset

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,440
and an open mindset um and

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,279
i mean it fits quite nicely um to an

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,240
apache con it's a nice

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,039
apache con summary slide to talk about

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,640
the mindset being

00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:41,679
open being uh yeah

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,320
helpful mind all this stuff so this is i

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,360
would say

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,880
the summary of my talk just

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,200
always keep in mind that they have a

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,200
different view of the world than we

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,679
all have this basically concludes

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,320
my talk and i am open for kind of

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,840
questions suggestions discussions or

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
sharing with you on a beer

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,880
but this silence drives me crazy

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,960
like chris i guess this is something you

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,440
can fix you can fix

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,440
at least

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,840
so um i will uh therefore give us some

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,760
questions

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,480
of the slides i will share the slides

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,320
somewhere i think we can drop the

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,919
we can drop them somewhere as speakers

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,640
but also that the recording will be

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,279
available and if not

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,760
just being me i mean i was clever enough

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,840
to

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,440
not have some references on me on the

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,720
slide

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,600
but uh but you may find me my name is

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,240
julian

00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,679
from the ps4x team and if you look on

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,039
the mailing list you may find chris

00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,720
first and particularly second is myself

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:04,320
i thank you all for those compliments

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,799
you are just such a lovely lovely

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,799
audience

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:15,120
okay i would say this is basically it

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,120
is there anything else i can do for you

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,240
well at least i can make you see me

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:28,240
drink one

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,240
this could be a very cold refreshing

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,679
so i guess i will sign off on time

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,120
that everybody has some time to

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,519
join the next session of the iot track

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,960
um let me have a quick view what this

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,039
will be

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,880
oh solving iot and edge connectivity

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,720
with apache projects

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,559
this is something i think we definitely

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,600
should have all have a look

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,480
so thanks everybody uh for sticking

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,600
around with me

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:19,919
and all of you a good day or good night

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:19,919
