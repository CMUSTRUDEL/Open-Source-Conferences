IoT and Edge solutions are all about connecting distributed systems together. But different use cases need different kinds of communication technologies. Luckily, Apache Software Foundation hosts multiple projects in this domain that can solve even the most challenging problems. Bonus point? They work great together as well, providing a great foundation layer for all your needs. In this session we'll discuss common communication patterns and where they fit IoT and Edge solutions. We'll dig into the Apache projects that enable them, such as Kafka, Qpid dispatch router and ActiveMQ. We'll discuss the differences and show where different approaches make the most sense. Finally, we'll explore how these projects can work together and provide a foundation layer for a wider ecosystem targeting specifically IoT and Edge use cases. We'll give a brief architecture of Eclipse Hono, EnMasse, Strimzi and Skupper projects. All based on Apache technologies. We'll see their benefits and place in the wider cloud IoT and Edge ecosystems.
