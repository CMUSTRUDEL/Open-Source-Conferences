Description: 
	Fostering strong, open source communities that benefit all of us

Catherine McGarvey, VP Engineering, VMWare


We all desire strong open source communities, but what does that even mean? What are health metrics that you can track and measure to see that you are making an impact here. Let's explore the different open source communities approaches as case studies. What actions can you take to help make your community more inclusive?


Catherine McGarvey is the VP of Engineering at VMware, leading engineering for developer facing communities. She has had the privilege of being involved in a number of OS communities including Apache Geode, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, cloud foundry and knative.

kim hwang speech i'm talking about

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
inequity

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,479
and the importance of addressing that

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,439
within our communities and within our

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,960
companies

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,360
and i think that was really really great

you to watch it

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
so i'm going to be speaking on a

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
parallel topic but a little bit

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,920
different

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,680
talking about fostering strong open

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
source communities that benefit all of

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
us

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
so firstly i'm a vp of engineering at

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,880
vmware i'm part of

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,799
team chanzu so i focus on all of the

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
developer facing products

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799
as part of the tenzi portfolio and i

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,320
love that that's my scope

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
because that's my where my heart and my

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,079
passion is as a developer myself

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
and that's my twitter handle if you're

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,720
interested

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,240
so i wanted to start and so to give you

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,159
a bit of my background and

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
why i value open source and sort of how

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
i came across it

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,479
so i've been doing software development

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
for just over 15 years

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,879
um i started off in c plus plus doing

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
sound and audio codecs um developing

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,280
apps

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
back in the day when that was the the

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,599
most common way to do software

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
development

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,120
and really focused on windows apps and

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,120
linux apps as part of doing that

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,599
i then started to get into python and

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
this is where i really first encountered

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,920
any open source in the in the sense of

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
the word we're using today

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,040
um and that was in using the django

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,360
library

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,599
i did a lot of.net in that time as well

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,879
and some transaction sql

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,400
and really focused on gis services so

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,400
a lot of mapping work i'm in that role

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
i then sort of switched languages again

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,599
and really looked into ruby on rails

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,879
a whole bunch of javascript frameworks

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,800
they seem to be sort of growing every

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,599
day back when i was doing that work

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,440
uh node.js backbone react and objective

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
query language and i was mostly focused

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,480
on websites so sort of

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
change the scope and change the language

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,680
at the same time

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,760
and then i've had two children and so my

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
maternity leave for my first child i

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
learned some spring and my second learn

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,480
some swift and also sort of

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,720
spent a bit of time playing around with

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,920
kubernetes

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,319
i'm sharing that background because i

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,120
wanted to really start on on the why

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,720
i find talking about the why we invest

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
in something or why we spend time on it

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,280
is really important

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,760
because it hones in on the importance

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,000
of the actions you take outside of that

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
way

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,840
so i taught you my background because i

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
want to talk about where i first

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,239
encountered

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
the negatives of not working in the open

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,239
source community

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,799
that first job i had and straight out of

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
college

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,480
doing c and c plus plus

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,319
we had set it up so that it was a c plus

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,799
plus development shop

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,840
and back in that time period it was a

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
real focus on

00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
how large your executable was because

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,519
everyone was

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
downloading at internet speeds for not

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,959
what they were

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
and we were worried that customers would

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
move away from

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,560
using our products if it took too long

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,640
too it was too large to download

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
um either with internet speed etc this

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,840
was back in australia and

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
australia's infrastructure at that time

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,359
i wasn't great so

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
and something else that was impacting

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,280
that so

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,000
the founder of this small startup that i

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,880
worked at it was about 20 people

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,880
and decided because of download size not

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
to use the standard template library

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,800
with c

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,680
plus plus so as a result

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,320
um internally we as a group spent a lot

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,280
of time rewriting the basic things in a

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,320
sort of a common

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,800
internal private library

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
and this is everything from sound card

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,759
drivers

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,240
which maybe is better in c anyway uh to

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,600
basic networking and string interaction

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,520
and so one day i found myself writing a

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,160
float to a string conversion

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,240
now it was a wrapper on another method

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,199
and it occurred to me i was gaining

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,759
all of this knowledge all in an area

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
that

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,280
wouldn't matter it wouldn't extend

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,039
beyond that current job and that current

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
role that i had

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
and so it was really limiting me to

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
spend all this time

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
investing in this common library that i

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,919
just couldn't apply elsewhere it's not

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,479
like i would

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,960
take that on to that next job so this

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
for me

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,160
really speaks to the benefit it's much

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
more extensible than

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
private repos now that may sound

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,960
simplistic to you but for me as i

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
thought about

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,039
gaining a knowledge and learning

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
something i'm having it so limited to

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,360
one current job

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
really limited my outlook

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,440
the second thing i'll share that i find

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
really valuable is opportunity to learn

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
from other people's code

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,479
if you've been around the software

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
development library

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,320
software development community for some

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
time and you've been working on a

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,880
project for some time you may have

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
encountered this experience and that

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,400
moment where you do a get blame

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,360
you know you're on a shared project with

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,440
other people and you see your own name

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
it's uh it's wonderful in some ways and

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,720
that you know you've grown since writing

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,280
that code and you can see your own

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,560
progress

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,639
that fast feedback as it exists and

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
but how much nicer is it to learn from

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,280
other people's code

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,000
it's faster and and you maybe not have

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,360
that cringe

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
worthy moment when you realize the

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,400
mistake you might have made

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,919
and then this this third one kind of

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,280
feels very self-explanatory i've sort of

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,280
seen this come out

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,039
um when you do a code reviews or paired

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,759
programming or you get someone else's

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,759
input and

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,759
immediately you're like oh that is such

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
a much better idea

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
and this benefit of doing things out in

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,240
the open this way

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
means that the code design is just going

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,840
to become better or there's more

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
opportunity for it to become better

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,919
so i share the why i now want to share

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,960
though what you should measure

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,039
and then i'm going to spend a bit of

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,400
time on a couple of things here so the

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,680
health metrics for growth

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,199
so the first thing that's really

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
interesting as we talk about health

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,599
metrics

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,440
is the governance model and i know

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
within apache that's kind of fairly

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,599
uh standard in other communities that

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
can be really different

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,199
and if you're interested in a good case

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,800
study in understanding

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,039
the things that govern or might change

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,880
within a community i've got two examples

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,440
up here k native recently have gone

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
through

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,199
quite a few discussions in this space of

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
what that governance model should be

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,240
what that who should be on a steering

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
committee what the scope of that

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,840
committee should be

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,639
and of course istio went through

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,639
something similar

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,680
the next metric that i'd recommend you

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,360
thinking about is responsiveness

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,840
what does the mailing list look like

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,080
what are those uh pull requests what's

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,680
that feedback cycle for them

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,960
now and i'm talking about these metrics

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,800
and these are really focused on

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,199
communities that want to grow

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,560
recognizing that not every open source

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
community is in the same state

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,479
so this is really focused on those that

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,680
are desiring a growth in their community

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
and in this space of

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,639
further development

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,599
the next one that's interesting is the

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,080
contributor activity and count

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,520
within the kubernetes community this is

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,120
kind of broken up into

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,400
a core 80 of the contributions are

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,400
regular 15

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,680
and a casual and within your own

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,199
community it might be interesting to

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,280
have a look at this breakdown

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,400
of what does what does those casual

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
committers look like

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
are you getting frequency with those

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,400
casual committers and then you're

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,400
growing and expanding

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
um the next piece there is commit

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,959
velocity how active is it like a little

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,680
graph of the top right

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,279
that highlights apache geode and just

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,040
what it what the commit velocity has

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,160
been for it over the years since it was

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,480
open sourced

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,160
so you can see like active communities

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
are generally more likely to attract

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,480
growth

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,760
within them and then release frequency

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,880
is a really interesting one if that

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
makes sense for the project you're

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,320
working on

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,160
um quarterly weekly monthly what's that

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,440
release frequency and the hope is that

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,640
it's consistent

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,760
that's the intent so it's predictable

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,880
so next up we've got inclusivity and

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,040
this is probably where i'm going to

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
spend a bit more of my time like kim i

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,560
really

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,399
value having um equity

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,920
within our communities and i want to

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,120
speak to some simple things you can do

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,440
to help with that

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
the first one is code of conduct

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,519
enforcement

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,880
so you might have a code of conduct but

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,240
are you actually enforcing it i'm going

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,160
to spend a few minutes talking about

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
that one

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
not enforcing it is the same as not

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,680
having a code of conduct

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,279
so the value really is in actually

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,640
utilizing what you put together

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,959
how do you address difficult

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,720
contributors how do you respond when

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,760
someone's on a mailing list

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,399
or in a form in some way

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,279
and and i think the best way to say it

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
is difficult

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,839
i'll leave you to define that further

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
and then do you have diversity in your

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,120
leadership

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,120
um different people come with different

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
perspectives and the benefits of having

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,480
that diversity is it'll leave you

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,480
open to thinking about the inclusive

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,760
community that you want and the diverse

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,760
community that you want to grow

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,399
what is the onboarding experience how

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
hard is it for a new person to join your

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,920
community what are the things that

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,600
you've set up to enable them to join and

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,040
to

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
add value early

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,760
and uh there's a really good link i put

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,720
at the bottom and i'll share it with my

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,680
slides that

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
actually speaks to these metrics in a

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,160
more

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,079
thorough way that i have here on this on

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,600
this slide and actually talks about

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,399
different considerations you might have

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
as you go through it

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,560
how to ensure these are not vanity

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,560
metrics

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
okay so thinking now we've got our

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,760
metrics

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,120
we sort of understand the value and

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,079
hopefully you've internalized your own

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,640
values

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,279
uh we've got metrics now let's actually

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,920
talk about

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,600
implementing uh that inclusivity piece

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
of those metrics

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,880
one interesting piece for me as i looked

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,640
at different communities

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,839
is there um one of the communities that

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,880
i was involved in

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,279
and had this concept around the apache

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
way

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,560
so if we speak about open which is a

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
concept i'm sure

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,079
most people in this school is familiar

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,839
with it's defined as technical decisions

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,120
are discussed decided and archived

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,600
publicly

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,680
in the team that i was involved in the

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
mantra within the team was if it didn't

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
happen on the mailing list it didn't

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,519
happen

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,399
and now this was great because it was

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,680
definitive

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,040
and it matched that open definition

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,959
but actually if you read ahead on my

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,760
slide as you can see if if you think

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,040
about basic

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,040
human patterns of behavior and

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,160
communication strategies and you limit

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,519
everyone to written form

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
and it can have really negative impacts

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,440
and

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
a couple of examples i'll give you that

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,279
i saw play out is

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,040
there a long email chains that were

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
turning non-constructive

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,240
sometimes with email you get into a

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,600
habit if you can respond the quickest

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,600
and you feel like the conversation might

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,440
move on without you so that can make you

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,240
perhaps more tourists in your response

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
to make sure

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,639
you get your perspective in there's no

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,079
movement to chat in person

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,399
call or at any time um

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,240
as a result what started to happen as

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
long time contributors

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,279
kind of didn't want to be on the mailing

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,959
list anymore

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,040
that's the real negative that's starting

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,800
to sort of really impact your community

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
i'd say the other way that this could

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,320
play out is perhaps new contributors are

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,279
on that mailing list and also seeing

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,839
that behavior

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,880
that may impact whether they want to

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,600
stay so

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,800
what might that community do differently

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,639
and

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
there could be daily or weekly public

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,160
discussion time it can be scheduled

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
and you can say what are the open issues

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,360
or topics that we're working through and

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
use that as an opportunity to discuss

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,760
things

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,360
i think changing that mantra to if

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,880
it didn't happen in the public it didn't

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,480
happen might be a better way to think

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
about this to give a bit more freedom on

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
the how

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,360
but still stick to that same desire on

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,600
the openness

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,440
so this is important because how you

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
behave directly impacts

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
who you attract to your community and if

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,920
you want to grow my hope is that you

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
want to grow

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,360
in a way that people feel valued and

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
part of the community

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
and not just growth there's a difference

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,200
between those

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,040
and it's difficult to really just grow

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,040
without that first step anyhow

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,120
the there's a great book building

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,040
successful online communities

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,800
evidence-based social design by robert

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,880
kraut and paul resnick

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,720
and a key takeaway they had was that

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,000
people sanction misbehaviors

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,760
because in the long run uh doing so

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
improves the welfare of the groups in

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,720
which they are apart

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
so by directly and enforcing your code

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
of conduct

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,000
you are improving the welfare of the

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
group that you're part of

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,720
by choosing not to enforce or not to

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,720
engage when there is an issue

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
you aren't helping the welfare of your

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
group

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,079
you aren't helping it potentially grow

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
you might be dissuading new members from

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,480
staying

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,920
so with this in mind we've talked

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,279
through values we've talked through

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,560
match tricks with talk through

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,160
inclusivity

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,760
i have three key tips for you to

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
consider and walk away with

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,680
so let's say you've put your metrics in

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
place um you've internalized your why

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
you probably had that done already

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,399
um what are the three things you should

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,199
actually start to do within your

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,079
community

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,360
to really create an impact here um now

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
of course if you don't have a code of

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
conduct or you haven't reviewed it

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,000
recently that would be

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,839
like the step zero but i'm gonna move on

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
from there and give you a couple more

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,160
tips

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,160
this is really important um we're

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,920
talking about growth

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,519
it's really critical that you guide the

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,680
time the time of your core team and

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,079
maintainers your contributors

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
if the core team is spending all of

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,880
their time

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,000
uh engaging on newbie questions

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,519
or prs that maybe aren't sort of up to a

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,440
level they need to be

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
um when you haven't sort of introduced

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
some level of

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,839
support in that model you're gonna have

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,680
challenges growing

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,270
so plan for how you can scale and

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,480
support your team

00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,920
[Music]

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,920
you might have sort of sensed this

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,519
coming as i talked about code of conduct

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,079
but review and establish patterns of

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,320
behavior

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,279
for all members not just the new not

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,800
just the

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,040
existing members and this should happen

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,160
regularly this is not a one-time event

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,160
have a look at your

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,360
last few mailing lists conversations or

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
have a look at your last through

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,279
discussions

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,839
how healthy were they how inclusive were

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
they

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,519
what sort of language was used what sort

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,440
of terms were discussed

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,120
where people shot down for having an

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,320
opinion rather than it being an open

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
discussion

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,720
you know we're not always going to just

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,320
agree on everything but my hope is that

00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,519
we can have civil discussions and

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,519
debates

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,240
um and use proof of concepts to prove

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,240
out value

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
and the third one is lower the barrier

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,680
to entry what does that process look

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,800
like

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,199
for a new person coming onto the team

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,399
how do they get engaged and how do they

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,320
get started without

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,519
impacting those that core team members

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,040
or that contributor

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,800
what are those tasks that you're

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,880
identifying for them to pick up

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,399
what's the guide for them to get started

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,800
how many steps do they have to go

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
through

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,360
to actually get involved um the more you

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,920
lower it lower that barrier

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
and you know and keep good systems in

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
place

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,720
the easier it is going to be to grow

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
your community

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,120
that's a three guard the time of your

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,880
core team and maintainers review and

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,079
establish patterns of behavior

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,839
and lower the barrier to entry

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,360
i've put some couple of resources here

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,959
if you want to learn more do you think

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,079
about health metrics i've got the link

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,639
in there for

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,759
uh that good debate describing them two

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
good books

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,040
and to consider you know there's a bit

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,880
of history involved there's a bit of

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,400
case studies as you go through them

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,000
uh working in public the making and

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,959
maintenance of open source software by

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,199
nadia

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,199
at eggball and then building successful

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,199
online communities evidence-based social

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,199
design robert crowe and paul resnick

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,439
and that's really all i had so welcome

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,039
any questions

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,039
or um can hand it back over

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,360
