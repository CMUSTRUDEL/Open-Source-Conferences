	In-Memory Computing Essentials For Software Engineers
Denis Magda

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Attendees will be introduced to the fundamental capabilities of in-memory computing platforms that are proven to boost application performance and solve scalability problems by storing and processing unlimited data sets distributed across a cluster of interconnected machines. The session is tailored for software engineers and architects seeking practical experience with in-memory computing technologies. You'll be given an overview (including code samples in Java) of in-memory concepts such as caches, databases, and data grids combined with a technical deep-dive based on Apache Ignite in-memory computing platform. In particular, we'll cover the following essentials of distributed in-memory systems: * Data partitioning: utilizing all memory and CPU resources of the cluster * Affinity co-location: avoiding data shuffling over the network and using highly-performant distributed SQL queries * Co-located processing: eliminating network impact on the performance of our applications

Denis Magda is an open-source enthusiast who started his journey in Sun Microsystems as a developer advocate and presently settled down at Apache Software Foundation in the roles of Apache Ignite committer and PMC member. He is an expert in distributed systems and platforms who actively contributes to Apache Ignite and helps companies to build successful open-source projects. You can be sure to come across Denis at conferences, workshops and other events sharing his knowledge about the open-source, community building, distributed systems.
