Description: 
	Double inflection point: Open Source meets AI
Sam Lightstone: Chief Technology Officer for AI Strategy, IBM


Abstract: Machine Learning is almost as old as the electronic computer, but the domain has experienced a massive infusion of energy and investment over the past 8 years. During this time the open source community has simultaneously developed a wide landscape of rich, sophisticated OSS packages for machine learning and deep learning such as Apache Marvin-AI, DLlab, Spark, MLlib, MADlib and OpenNLP. In this talk IBM CTO for AI Strategy, Sam Lightstone, will explore the confluence of these two disruptions and the possibilities that lie ahead for dramatic advances in AI, computation power, distributed computing, and a sea-change in computer science.

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,320
our next keynote presentation

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,160
uh is actually a colleague of mine since

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
his company acquired mine a little while

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,800
ago

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,160
this is sam lightstone who is the chief

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,440
technology officer

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,640
for ai strategy at ibm thank you for

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,960
joining us

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,800
and sam's going to talk to us about the

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,199
intersection of open source

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,160
and artificial intelligence so without

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,079
further ado

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,079
let's go with sam here

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,760
okay wonderful thank you are you able to

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,960
see my screen okay yes i can see it

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
okay i'm gonna step off stage now all

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,799
right

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,320
uh welcome everybody and and um

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,439
thank you for joining today and it's my

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
pleasure to have this opportunity to

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
speak at apachecon

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,240
actually pretty exciting for me and um

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,640
hopefully this will be of some interest

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
to you

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,840
so let's jump into it i want to talk

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,799
today about this interesting double

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,240
inflection point

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,280
uh where open source meets ai

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
um we are living now

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
at the brink of a new era it's not

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,799
always obvious to us

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,320
because our lives haven't yet changed

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,119
too dramatically because of it but

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
actually

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,640
we're living at this remarkable

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,360
inflection in inflection point in

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
history

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
some of you may know this man this is

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,799
arthur samuel he was a research

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,159
scientist at ibm in the 1950s

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
and i don't know what they actually paid

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,479
him for but he had a dream

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,159
to create a system that could play

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,600
checkers you may say well

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,600
who cares about a machine that can play

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,680
checkers in the 1950s

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
but actually it wasn't just a game that

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,799
could play checkers he wanted to create

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,600
a machine learning system

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,360
a system that learned from experience

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,840
the more experience it had

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,239
the better it got the more games of

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,560
checker it played the better it got

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,840
and he created this machine learning

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
checkers game

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
um really the first of its kind and he

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640
coined the phrase machine learning in

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,440
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,280
in 1962 his machine learning checkers

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,200
game played a regional state champion by

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,440
the game of robert neely

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,959
and one and although probably nobody

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,640
noticed it at the time we can look back

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,840
and say that was a pivotal moment in

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,000
history where a machine being a human

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,360
a human expert at a game of tactics and

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
strategy

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
and arthur samuel was just one of many

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,800
seminal thinkers in those days the 40s

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,720
50s and 60s

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
other names are very well known to all

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
of us alan turing herbert simon

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,840
marvin minsky and others none of those

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,680
people those seminal thinkers those

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
founders of machine learning ai

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
probably knew what the story arc would

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,159
be or the role that open source would

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,120
play in all of it

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,239
but actually today almost every industry

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,519
that you can think of

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,680
is being disrupted by ai

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
um i've listed just a few here but you

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,239
know name

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959
name your field of interest whether it's

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,120
an industrial topic or an academic topic

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,720
physics and chemistry and drug

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
development fraud detection

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,920
you know weather forecasting you name it

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,680
it's all being

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
disrupted today by ai

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,280
um now in particular when it comes to

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,480
apache apache is really at the

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,760
forefront of a lot of this and at ibm

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
we're actually quite proud of our

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,799
association with apache

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,239
um starting in 1999 we helped with the

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,040
formation of the apache software

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,120
foundation

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
contributing uh thousands of lines of

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
code to the original apache web server

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,840
and since then we've contributed to many

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,439
many projects you can see here a list of

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,280
some that we are very actively

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,560
contributing to today

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
so um apache actually is at the

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,720
forefront

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,319
of a lot of this new era of ai

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,959
and many of the foundational components

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,920
of apache make it possible to do ai

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
today

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,640
now i want to talk about this inflection

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
point a little bit and show you some

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,920
data

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,040
what you see on the left is the growth

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,120
in apache

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,079
project code that's related to data ops

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
and analytics

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,919
machine learning ops and so on all the

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
all the machine learning

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,280
related componentry and its growth on

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,160
the left

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,960
over the last uh more than a decade on

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,280
the right hand side you can see the idc

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,639
projection on the ai business growth now

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,919
they're pretty strongly correlated it's

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,199
not a perfect correlation but it's

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,919
pretty tight

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,600
now you know correlation does not imply

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,639
causality but

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
i actually believe that there is

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,800
more than just a correlation that's

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,479
going on it's actually a dependency

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,759
the growth in ai depends hugely

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,560
on the willingness of the community

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,759
to bring machine learning and and data

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,919
ops

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,639
to the to the world through a community

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,360
process of open source

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,919
there is no domain of computer science

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,919
that has

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,960
that has been growing as quickly as the

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,520
domain of ai

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
has been growing since 2012. it's

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,360
unprecedented the past 50 years nothing

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,880
has moved this fast

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,280
and the only way that we know how to

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,800
move fast as a community is to work

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,039
together

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,960
at the only efficient model that we know

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
for working together on software

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,320
is open source that's why the open

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
source

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,919
uh is so vitally important to ai

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,280
and that's why the apache foundation and

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,160
all those components that we know and

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,680
love you know

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,960
spark and mlib and uh apache parquet

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,440
and apache kafka you know apache arrow

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,280
all

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,720
these and you know in emerging packages

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
as well much

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
that are you know directly related to

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
machine learning algorithms

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,360
all this is not just coincidentally

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
correlated

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,680
it's a complete dependency ai can only

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,400
move as fast as it's moving

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,919
because of the open source community and

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,880
the apache foundation is playing a

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,280
tremendous role in that

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
all right so let's talk about how we got

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,800
here a little bit

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,039
because a very interesting story you

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,680
talk about some of these foundational

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,759
thinkers you know marvin minsky and

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,880
arthur samuels and alan turing

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
all that was you know 40s 50s 60s and in

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,560
fact when you look at

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,840
a lot of the popular algorithms and i've

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,280
listed some on the left

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,360
machine learning algorithms and deep

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,520
learning algorithm there's sort of

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,600
dozens if not hundreds of these machine

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,360
the deep learning algorithms

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,759
uh based on neural networks deep neural

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,319
networks what's interesting about these

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,680
things that you see on the left

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,000
most of them were embedded in the 50s

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,919
60s and 70s and the deep learning

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,599
a lot of it in the foundations of it

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,520
anyway um

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,319
artificial neural networks and back back

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,919
propagation and so on in the 1980s

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
so what happened what happened you know

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,080
it's sort of a curiosity

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,560
this isn't new tech it's actually old

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,759
tech how do we get here

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
well there are three things that

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,960
happened to bring us to this moment in

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,680
history

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,520
um the first was the rise of big data

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,319
which really happened

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,759
in the early 2000s the internet comes of

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,840
age

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,199
digital transactions become the norm

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,800
people start pooling data

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,880
from their operational systems or

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
transactional systems into larger

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
collections called data warehouses and

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,520
then

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,800
data lakes and all of a sudden we have

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,560
digital data

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
that we can start doing machine learning

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
on you know in the 50s 60s and 70s

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,960
there's a lot of data and there's

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,520
handwritten data there's typewritten

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
data

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,599
there's no digital data they're very

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,360
very slim digital data

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,199
what happens in the early 2000s as we

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
get this like huge increase

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,720
of digital data and that's incredibly

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
important for the advancement of ai

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,479
because these algorithms that we just

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
showed previously are hungry

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,960
for digital data the second big

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
inflection point that comes is

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,960
the advent of low-cost compute

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,800
in 1997 ibm creates a deep blue computer

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,479
that beats gary kasparov at chess

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
so this big super computer you know

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,599
fills half a room

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,280
um but today today you know you've got

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,039
a cell phone probably in your in your

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
hand or your pocket right now

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,039
that has more processing power measured

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,919
in gigaflops than the super computer

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,599
that be carried

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,360
gary kasparov in 1997. more processing

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,599
power than a 1997

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,360
supercomputer in your pocket and for

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,440
pennies literally for pennies you can

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,959
log on to a public cloud

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,080
and lease thousands of

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,760
cores i mean the equivalent of thousands

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,479
of your cell phone

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,839
for very low cost so the processing

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,720
power that's available to us now is

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,480
incredibly

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,600
incredibly available incredibly cheap

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,880
and you can just pay for it when you

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
need it and so on

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,880
so that's a huge inflection because

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,720
again all of these algorithms

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
are hungry for compute whether it's cpu

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
or gpu or

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,600
specialized asics but still we don't

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,640
hear too much

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,519
until this third inflection point 2012

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,680
which began with imagenet imagenet was a

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,800
global challenge that was started by a

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,080
computer professor by the name of

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
fei-fei li

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519
who is the sequoia professor of computer

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,200
science at stanford university

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
and she started this organization

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,560
imagenet where

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,640
you know different research groups would

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,320
show up and try their algorithms

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
on an arbitrary collection a large

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,640
arbitrary collection of digital images

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,399
and the challenge was can your ai

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,279
algorithm figure out what is in the

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,320
image you know

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,519
an image of a of a boat a broom a cat

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,720
two people smiling

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,720
whatever and then suddenly

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,040
in 2012 a research group out of the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,800
university of toronto

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,880
um really the research led by a grad

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,480
student by the name of alex kravesky

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,240
and his uh supervisor

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,320
um jeffrey hinton and the two of them

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
bring together this this new algorithm

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
based on convolutional neural networks

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
that creates a quantum leap forward in

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,640
the in the result on the imagenet

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,800
challenge

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,079
and all of a sudden everybody worldwide

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
all the research groups wake up and they

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,079
go wow

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,680
wow what just happened okay

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,000
so um since then the world has really

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
taken off with ai at ibm we're excited

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,560
to have

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,560
a very broad portfolio of ai technology

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,480
you know i won't deliver the details too

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
much here but you know we have

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
we have tools we have pre-built models

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,279
then we have

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,160
uh ai-powered solutions that are

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,320
embedding the two lower layers

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,279
but the key point is this it's all built

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
on open source

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,279
and a lot of it from the apache

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,320
foundation whether it's spark ammo lib

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,760
and kafka and so on um

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,839
let me just share with you a few fun

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,200
examples interesting examples from ibm

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,120
and other companies

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
and the few minutes that remain we've

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,480
created uh project debater

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
an ai system that can debate with human

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,120
beings on topics of serious social

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,120
consequence

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,720
not just you know what's the weather

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
outside i don't need an ai to tell me

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,600
that i can look out the window but to

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,079
debate with human beings

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,440
live and it only needs 15 minutes to

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,720
prepare on a debate topic

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,519
amazing you may have seen

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,959
rai in action at the u.s open fielding

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,279
questions about you know

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,279
tennis history and tennis great tennis

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,360
questions of you know was the greatest

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,880
uh rivalry of tennis players of all time

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,920
and so on

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,839
um we're featuring our ai technology

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,240
with bloomberg's intelligence squared

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,760
on their new that's debatable program

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
synthesizing input for

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,839
thousands of people on opinions on

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,079
debate topics and summarizing them in

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,240
natural language

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,760
um we're also bringing ai to espn

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,839
fantasy football with our trade

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,680
assistant you know use ai to get better

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,440
more intelligent trades of players

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,120
on esports um those are some fun

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
examples and of course we're solving

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
important business problems as well

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
across the industry but all of it

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,320
building on open source building on

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,839
componentry from the apache foundation

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
that we're also proud to be strong

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,880
contributors to

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,680
i want to show you one fun example from

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,880
a few

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,120
[Music]

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,160
a few creative uses of ai let's look at

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,320
this first one from nvidia and

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,600
in this example you're going to see

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
we'll start with some

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
images that are real people have a look

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
at these faces you can tell these are

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,519
real people you can see elements of

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
gender

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,639
elements of style elements of age you

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,079
can see

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,399
you know they're they have some clothing

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,440
that they're wearing and so on these are

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,480
real people and these are

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,160
photos taken from an online um online

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
celebrity database

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,399
now let's have a look as well at some

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
people who were created

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
fictional people who are created after

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,079
training on that database

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
generate images created by an ai called

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,680
a gan

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
again is a generative adversarial

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,120
network

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,800
these people are fake they never existed

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,079
they're created purely by the gan

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,639
after training on the celebrity data set

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,200
you can see the same elements of age and

00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,200
gender

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
and style you can see every whisker on

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,720
these guys faces you can see

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,000
hairdos and it's not just the faces

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
notice that some people are wearing

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,079
jewelry

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,399
you can see the a little bit of the

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:13,200
clothing that they're wearing and so on

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,519
it's really quite remarkable and

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,120
let's very quickly watch how the gan is

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,120
built up

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
progressively over time now it actually

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,639
takes about 20 days

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
to generate these kinds of images on

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
high powered gpus

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,639
but we're going to speed it up here into

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,839
about 15 seconds for you

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,839
and have a look at that image on the top

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
middle

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
and after about 19 days of training you

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
get this photorealistic

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
image of a of a man and it's really

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,199
striking if you were to see this guy's

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,279
face

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,160
in a magazine you wouldn't stop twice to

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,680
think that that was a fake

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,279
and similarly as people are doing that

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,199
for photorealistic images people are

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,959
doing it for artwork is an example of

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,959
madame de bellamy which was

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,000
sold at auction at christie's about two

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,720
years ago

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,560
um created entirely by ai and there's

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,279
lots of these examples of ai creating

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,160
music eric quick and poetry and so on

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,079
so you know i hope this has just been um

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
a little bit reflective for you

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,600
the 1970s were the era of the mainframe

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,000
where digital transactions became the

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,720
norm

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,279
then came the pc era and the networking

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,680
era

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,839
where we grew the developer community to

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,000
over a million people
