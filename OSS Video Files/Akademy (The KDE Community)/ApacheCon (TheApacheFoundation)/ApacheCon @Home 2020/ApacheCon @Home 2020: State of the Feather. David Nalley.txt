00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,519
good morning folks

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
i also want to welcome you to apache com

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,559
at home

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,480
i will admit i had a little bit of

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,880
skepticism when

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,000
this first was pitched as a virtual

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,760
event

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,840
one of the things that i really enjoy is

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,440
getting to spend time meeting new

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
community members

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,160
and hanging out with old friends that's

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
actually been one of my favorite parts

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
of apache con

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,719
and this year for obvious reasons we

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,160
can't do that we're doing it all

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,840
virtually

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,559
but then i started to see some of the

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,120
potential and

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
even some of the impact that rich and

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
ruth and

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,560
and others have been able to put

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,400
together i'm personally excited

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,640
because this year we have more people

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,119
attending from more places around the

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,280
world

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,040
we have more content than we've ever had

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,400
and in more languages

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,600
than we've ever tried to attempt so

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
lots of lots of awesome opportunity

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,680
that's come together because this

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280
virtual apache con

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
so to those of you who are attending

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,799
your first apache con and i just heard

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,640
rich say that that's uh over 89

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
i think uh welcome

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,360
i think this year will be a little

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,000
different but i think it's going to be

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
exciting

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,840
and i hope that you're going to take

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
advantage of not just the immense amount

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,560
of content that's going to be here

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
but also the unprecedented amount of

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,479
access that you're going to have

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,720
to people who work on this software

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,320
people who use the software

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,920
the community around it and i hope that

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,520
like you you will be spending as much

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,520
time in the hop-in platform

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,079
and slack as possible and that's what i

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,360
plan to do over the next couple of days

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,239
and i hope that i get a chance to

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,720
converse with many of you

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,000
that said i'm not really here to talk

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
about apache con

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
i'm sure rich is off wondering why i'm

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
changing from

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
talking about the apache software

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,440
foundation to covering

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,239
content that he just covered but i'm

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,800
really here to talk about the asf

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
and normally at this point i'd bring up

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
a slide

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,760
that would have lots of statistics and

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,040
we'd start delving into things like code

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,120
velocity

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,599
and project statistics and those are

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,959
important and i will get back to them

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,560
but in the past six months or so

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,680
the conversations that i've been having

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,760
with people have been a lot of concern

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
how is the apache software foundation

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,080
weathering the pandemic

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,040
what's the impact is it going to go

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,959
under

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
and so i want to start by talking about

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,440
the organization itself

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
and because so many of you are new to

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,200
apache con

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
i want to set some fundamental

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,879
understanding and expectations of what

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,159
the asf is

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
so the apache software foundation is a

00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,159
501c3

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,280
non-profit public benefit charity

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,080
we work to release open source code free

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,239
of charge

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,920
for the public good and we've been

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
around for a little over 20 years

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,640
and as a

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,239
non-profit as a charity that doesn't

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
sell its software we give it away for

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,000
free

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,959
that makes us entirely dependent upon

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
our sponsors

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,480
and our sponsors are incredibly generous

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
to us

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,000
and they allow us to operate and

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,440
this year with the pandemic going on

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
frankly there's been

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,200
uh there's been a couple of sponsors who

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,680
have

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,840
been impacted by the pandemic they've

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,080
had either

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,319
uh reduce or in some cases even

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,480
eliminate their sponsorships

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,200
but we've also been very fortunate to

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,360
to acquire a couple of new sponsors and

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,479
during the same time period

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,479
and so uh it's also important that you

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,680
understand that our fiscal year

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,000
was ending about the time that people

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
were

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
beginning to understand that this was

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
going to be a long-term

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,800
high-impact health event that's going to

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,600
impact the world

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,479
and so we had a budget already planned

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
we had a budget

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,919
ready to go to be approved by the board

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,840
of directors

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,000
right as the world health organization

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,880
was declaring a global pandemic

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,919
and so we threw that out we started over

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
and said

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,120
what can we eliminate obviously we're

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
going to eliminate lots of

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
travel because there's not going to be

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
an in-person apache con

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,960
we can eliminate a lot of other things

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,880
and we reduced our budget even more

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,479
to become more frugal

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
and you know we generally operate

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,600
frugally anyway

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,680
but but we cut even more for this year

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,360
and i'm happy to report that the apache

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,240
software foundation has

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
roughly 15 months of cash reserves in

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
place

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,360
and that gives us confidence that we can

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
continue to operate

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,199
and again we're very thankful to our

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,880
generous sponsors who

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
continue to fund us and allow us to

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
operate but

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,320
even with this degree of uncertainty

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,440
that that the world's in

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,600
we feel like we're in a very good place

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,440
so then after people ask about you know

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,639
the financial and organizational health

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,360
of the asf

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
their next question is okay that's great

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
but

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,880
does anyone care about open source in

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,960
the midst of a pandemic

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,479
is anyone working on it are you shipping

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:56,160
software

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,520
and you know there's a lot of uh

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
there's a lot of concern that you know

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,160
people are just not going to work on

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
that especially when you're talking

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,840
about an all-volunteer organization

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,600
like the asf is but since the world

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,759
health organization declared a global

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,360
pandemic on march 11th

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,639
apache projects have produced

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,000
almost 500 software releases and

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,880
that has generated 1592 release

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
artifacts and that's just since march

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
11th

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,039
if you look at the number of active

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,080
committers

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,759
active commits that are happening

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:37,360
the pattern is is pretty consistent with

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,680
with what was happening before and

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,400
that remarkable consistency is pretty

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
amazing to me

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,400
you can see that roughly the same number

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
of people

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,520
both committers and authors of code has

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,360
stayed

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:57,120
pretty consistent over that time

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,599
and i had a big slide up uh that had

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,479
uh interesting statistics like the fact

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,039
that we have 227 million lines of code

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,000
under our stewardship we have 200 top

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,000
level projects

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
this year the apache software foundation

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,080
graduated

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,400
eight top level projects so they

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,919
essentially moved from the incubator

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,599
they had proven themselves and the board

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,280
of directors established them as top

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,599
level projects

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,680
so we continue to grow the number of

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,919
projects that are

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,039
that are producing code and have met our

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
standards

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,120
we still have another 47 projects that

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,840
are working their way through the

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
incubator

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,240
and trying to establish themselves as

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,000
top level projects

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,919
but i also want to talk about something

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,319
that's not as exciting

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,960
this year in the past year we've moved

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
14 projects to the attic

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,520
now the attic isn't where we go to throw

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,800
away old projects or old code

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,879
the attic is where code moves

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
when the underlying project community

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,919
decides that the project has reached

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,240
the end of its life or the community

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,919
ceases to be able to govern itself and

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,080
maintain itself and that's an important

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,080
uh distinction that the code may be

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,840
incredibly high quality it may be very

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,680
usable but we want to set an expectation

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,720
with our users

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,240
because projects and communities have

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
life cycles

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,000
and we want our users to have confidence

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,680
that when they're consuming

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,159
software from a top level project that

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
there's an uh expectation that someone's

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,680
going to be around to fix bugs

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
that someone's going to be around to

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,240
take care of security issues

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,800
and we also want to set the expectation

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
when that's not the case

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,000
we consider that part of the

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,120
responsibility

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,279
for our stewardship of this uh massive

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,320
amount of open source code

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,040
and uh you know it

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,200
it brought to mind another conversation

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
that we recently had we had a

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
little bit of a soul-searching

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,600
discussion

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,800
involving exploring what made the asf

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
valuable

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,200
and what made us unique are we

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,440
continuing to add value to the ecosystem

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,399
and so lots of lots of things were

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,120
tossed around as

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
things that we add to the conversation

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,279
uh

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
you know we produce high quality

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,680
software we produce high quality

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,839
software that's permissively licensed

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,920
our decision making is transparent and

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,320
based on consensus

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,080
the people who do the work get to make

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,120
the decisions

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,560
we care so much about the people that

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,600
one of our mottos is community over code

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,040
and we have this history of producing

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,120
uh having good uh intellectual property

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,640
hygiene

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
but the word that stood out to me the

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,800
most was that we've earned

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
trust and it's not like all of the other

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,440
attributes

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,279
of the asf and its projects

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,519
instead that trust has been earned over

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,480
a number of years people know what to

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
expect

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
they know what to expect when they

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
engage with an apache project

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,160
they know what to expect when they

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,600
download apache software

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,480
and i think that speaks volumes but as i

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,600
considered that

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,760
more i realized you know that's

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
something that a collection of

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,000
volunteers and a collection of

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,959
volunteers that has changed over time

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,600
has been able to achieve over a period

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,240
of over two decades

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
and they have still earned and retained

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
that trust

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,839
of the public i think that speaks

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,600
volumes about both the past

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
and the future of the apache software

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,079
foundation it has me excited about

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
what's coming up next as we continue to

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,880
grow

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
and i'm sure that like me as you're

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,360
going to be attending all of these

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,000
uh sessions at apachecon learning about

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,200
new and interesting bits of technology

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,519
uh that that's going to be fascinating

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,480
but i'd encourage you to take some time

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,279
engage with

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,880
these members of the community because

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,399
those volunteers are what makes this

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,519
possible and what makes the apache

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,200
software foundation such a special place

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,040
thank you so much i look forward to

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
engaging with you both on half on

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,440
slack

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,200
thank you david i'm going to step away

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
for just a moment now and bring our next

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,839
keynote speaker on stage in just a

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
