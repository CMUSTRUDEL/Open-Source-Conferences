by thanking our sponsors none of this

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,840
would be possible without our sponsors

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,520
and these are organizations that provide

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,960
both financial support and also

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,920

sponsors that have made all of this

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,119

that

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,959
this conference is being run under the

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,360
apache code of conduct

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,760
if you look at the apache con website or

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,720
at the url that you see on your screen

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,959
you will see that code of conduct we do

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,599
expect that attendees of this event

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
will abide by this code of conduct and

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,239
treat

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
other people on the platform with

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,280
respect and dignity and politeness

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,360
failure to do so will unfortunately

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,480
result in people being removed from the

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,319
event

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,159
so please do look at that code of

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,400
conduct and understand that we take it

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:22,800
extremely seriously

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,120
