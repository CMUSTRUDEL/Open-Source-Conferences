	Heating Up Analytical Workloads with Apache Druid

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Apache Druid is a modern analytical database that implements a memory-mappable storage format, indexes, compression, late tuple materialization, and a vectorized query engine that can operate directly on compressed data. This talk goes into detail on how Druid's query processing layer works, and how each component contributes to achieving top performance for analytical queries. We'll also share war stories and lessons learned from optimizing Druid for different kinds of use cases.

Gian Merlino is CTO and a co-founder of Imply, a San Francisco based technology company, and a committer on Apache Druid. Previously, Gian led the data ingestion team at Metamarkets (now a part of Snapchat) and held senior engineering positions at Yahoo. He holds a BS in Computer Science from Caltech.
