Apache Airflow is a Python-based workflow management system that can be used to actively monitor and execute transactions on blockchain networks like Ethereum. This presentation is an introduction to Apache Airflow followed by a demonstration of a production deployment. Apache Airflow is an excellent tool for anyone already familiar with Python. Its ability to process jobs and handle errors makes it a good choice tool for managing activity on blockchain networks. The goal of this talk is to demonstrate how Apache Airflow can be used for environmental scanning and batch processing transactions. The demonstration will cover using Airflow and Python for monitoring and executing ERC20 token transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
