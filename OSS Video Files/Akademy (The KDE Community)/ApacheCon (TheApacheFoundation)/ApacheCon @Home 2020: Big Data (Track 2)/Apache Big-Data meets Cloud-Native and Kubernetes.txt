MÃ¡rton Elek

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Apache big-data projects / the Hadoop ecosystem is widely adopted and very popular so the Kubernetes / Cloud-native tools. Surprisingly there are only a very minimal number of projects in the intersection of the two words. This presentation explains why could it be, shows the key problems to run Apache Big-Data projects (such as Hadoop, Kafka, Flink, Spark...) on Kubernetes and gives a demo of a possible solution.

Marton Elek is PMC in Apache Hadoop and Apache Ratis projects and working on the Apache Hadoop Ozone at Cloudera. Ozone is a new Hadoop sub-project which provides an S3 compatible Object Store for Hadoop on top of a new generalized binary storage layer. He is also working on the containerization of Hadoop and creating different solutions to run Apache Big Data projects in Kubernetes and other could native environments.
