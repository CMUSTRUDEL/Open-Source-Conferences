	FOSS Never Forgets: An Introduction to Free and Open Source Solutions for Data Processing and Management with an Emphasis on Fault Tolerance
Katie McMillan

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

This talk will provide an introduction to data processing and management in two of the most popular Free and Open Source Solutions: Hadoop and PostgreSQL. The talk will link these solutions to current challenges in big data, with an emphasis on the fault tolerancy of each solution. It will then show how the solutions can be used together, using Foreign Data Wrappers. By combining the functionality of PostgreSQL and Hadoop with Foreign Data Wrappers, one is able to apply ACID properties to processes (transactions) in Hadoop.
