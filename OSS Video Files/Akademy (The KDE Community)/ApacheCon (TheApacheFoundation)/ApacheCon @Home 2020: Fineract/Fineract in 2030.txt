00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,640
first of all welcome to the second day

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
it's uh it's a great it's a great

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
pleasure to be here it's this

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,800
yesterday was a very interesting day we

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,920
had a lot of

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,960
a few panels a few presentations

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,160
it was a great day um and after

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,039
we we met on the birth of a pet of a

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
feather

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,680
session i think that that was most the

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
most

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,440
for me the most incredible time and

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,879
been able to chat with you all of you it

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,879
was amazing

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,879
um it it it almost felt like we were in

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,799
in the lobby in the hotel after the

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,080
conference sharing a beer or something

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,760
it almost felt like that almost almost

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,200
it was very good almost yeah so the idea

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,920
of this panel

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,400
i know that 10 years in technology it's

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,840
it's a

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,439
it's too long shot but the the idea is

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,640
to be a little bit um

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,600
is to have something that uh allowed us

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
to think

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,159
uh long and far away so uh

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,840
we all want to see this community uh

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,640
for 20 years 30 years or more and and we

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,119
know that we have a lot of a lot of

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,079
things to share and to to to add to the

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,240
world

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,640
and but but but we need to start

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
thinking on the long run

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
now there is movement on what is the

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
next

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,520
delivery how we are going to ship this

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,040
this solution

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,000
but also while that happens also we need

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
to think

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,079
uh what we need to do

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,759
in in in five and three five eight

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,599
ten years to to make ours our community

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,080
sustainable to make our community

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,080
survive

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,959
so what what do we need to do in in

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,400
order to to make this

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,080
this community uh stay longer and and

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,680
and and and be

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,080
a relevant software community

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,120
in the fintech world and in the finance

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,280
world

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,080
um the the open the the

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,239
digital and core banking industry it's

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,200
an industry of 20 billion dollar per

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,640
year

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,120
and and that that it's a huge industry

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,080
so uh banks and financial institutions

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,640
are spending

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
20 billion dollars per year on new

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,800
technologies

00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,640
new developments and and

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
i know and i just for for my experience

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,000
and

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
what i know from the community we are

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,239
just

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,879
getting a tiny tiny fraction of that

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:18,640
revenue as an open source community so

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,840
what we need to do to in 20 in 10 years

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,120
uh be the linux as they are as

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:30,239
as as as the as the

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,720
um the the the the the fintech community

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,840
what we need to do in order to our

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,879
community

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,239
uh be relevant and compete with the big

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,720
vendors

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,440
of preparatory software and and make

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,720
everybody use

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,920
finra what we need to do for

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,760
seeing i don't know chase manhattan and

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
change the entire the entire core

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,439
banking for

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,599
for finra so those are the questions

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,799
that that i want to address here

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,120
and um i will start

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:08,239
uh by uh letting you introduce yourself

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
for a couple of minutes and i will start

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,840
with

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,120
with gabrielle gabriel um

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,840
so uh you you are from the phoenix

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,759
community

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,320
uh an uh uh a a brother or sister

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
open source community so what we can

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
learn from other communities how we can

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,199
collaborate together

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,440
and and how we can potentiate together

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
as open source communities

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,080
first of all if you can introduce

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,400
yourself and then answer the question

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,280
absolutely and javier first of all

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
thanks for

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,479
having me here and really nice to meet

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,800
all the other panelists

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,520
a quick introduction on me i think first

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,040
of all i'm really happy to hear

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,840
the questions that you're asking they're

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,400
very ambitious and i think that's

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,000
the right time to ask ourselves this

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
type of questions

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,600
it's certainly questions that i've been

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,720
asking myself

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,360
a lot maybe not necessarily just

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,400
specifically about finra act but

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
just generally going to what i do i'm

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,560
the executive director of finance the

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,360
fintech open source foundation

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,919
um we've been spending the last five

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
years

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,360
to create a really awareness

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
in the financial services industry which

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,240
has been historically a big

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,280
consumer of open source as much as maybe

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
they

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
sometimes seem to not know or not

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,080
realize

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,880
um but really the last five years have

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
been spent

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,039
to create the awareness that

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,240
contribution is actually

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,120
what ultimately will deliver value to

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
some of these large corporates and so as

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
a foundation we

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
we were a 501c6 foundation until about

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,160
six months ago

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,639
when we recently joined the linux

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,680
foundation so we are now the umbrella

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,520
under the linux foundation for pretty

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,319
much anything related to financial

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,840
services and

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
whether that's open source open

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,360
standards we have about 100 projects

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,440
under the foundation um

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
i have a sweet spot for apache in my

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,960
heart as i am

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
and now i married this apache committer

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,919
i haven't

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,520
uh committed for a while but certainly

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,880
that's that's where i

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,319
started and learned uh the the apache

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,960
way and just the the

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,639
you know the art of open source i would

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,840
say so

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,319
um you know i think for me personally

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,120
and just professionally we are measured

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
on

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,840
the growth of open source in financial

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,560
services that doesn't mean

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,080
only phenos that means how we can

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,720
collaborate with other

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,759
adjacent communities like finra and so

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,000
i'm really happy to

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,880
to be having this conversation um

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,479
without com

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
you know without without clogging the

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,960
conversation here i think

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,960
um the main again

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,120
how do we get this collaboration to

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,520
happen i think it's always going to be a

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,199
combination for my experience of

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,080
you know our bottom-up grassroots

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,639
uh collaboration across communities you

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,199
know

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,840
even though i run a foundation which is

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,479
of course very largely corporate driven

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,680
i think a lot of our success has been

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,800
due to the fact that

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,800
we brought the true transparency

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,520
meritocratic

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
you know through very much the apache

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,280
way that i grew in

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,599
into a world that you know five years

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,360
ago would look at us with very different

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
eyes that it does right now and so

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,560
definitely we need to continue fostering

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,960
the sort of the grassroot collaboration

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,360
but i think it's also important uh if

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,319
you look at you know other communities

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
say the big data community and loop you

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
know

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,919
the commercial support behind certain of

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,199
these efforts again when

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,560
is within again the right framework of

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,319
open source

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
i think it's also important and that's

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
really what i what we've tried to do

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
in phenols for the last five years i'm

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
sure we'll talk about

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
more in detail so i want to give a

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,039
chance to the other panelists to chime

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,039
the most

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,880
innovative countries and the startup

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:36,719

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,080
yeah and and also you had a

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,880
quite a big experience working with the

softwares and now you are

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,279
coming to the open source so what things

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,399
do we need to see

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,160
in the community to compete with the the

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,760
big names of the industry like the

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,360
temenos the infancy

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,279
saps so what things do you do you think

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
that we need to bring to this community

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,839
to

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,800
to be relevant okay and also if you can

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,519
introduce yourself before yeah

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,560
definitely

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,600
so um as you said i'm david

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,399
i'm from israel from tel aviv

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,760
i'm the co-founder of hyper core and

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
rtcode

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,920
articode is a development software

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,120
company basically a project company

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,279
and we had experience uh

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,480
in the last three years working with

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,480
finrac for two years

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
building projects for for people we've

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,959
collaborated with fita as well

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,959
um and uh recently we've decided to

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,000
create hypercore which is

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:52,160
um a new startup company um

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,680
which is using uh finrac as its core

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,800
uh core system so we've actually

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,920
decided to to bet everything

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,480
on finrac being the

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,519
good financial core and this is as

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,760
you've said

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,800
um part of my or this decision

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,279
um was after um

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,399
me myself i was in the past the

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,519
developer

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,079
in one of the second biggest bank in

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,360
israel

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,959
who were launching a digital

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,320
um a digital uh financial

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,720
uh or a digital bank basically a new neo

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,360
bank

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,240
um under their umbrella and i've had

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,519
the i don't know if it's this it's the

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
joy or

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
i i had the opportunity to experience

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,079
working with

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
with the biggest vendors

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,160
and yeah basically i was very

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
unimpressed to say the least

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,240
as i'm a software developer for for the

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,920
past 12 years i'm an

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,040
open source uh developer part of a

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,839
large javascript community uh doing like

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,959
various

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:13,200
different things um and

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,600
it was a very concerning to see like

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,320
what

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:21,839
are like how those systems look like

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,440
and really after i've

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,480
uh basically seen finrac

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,320
finrax um you know uh

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,680
approach to developing um

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,959
you know the the best tool set possible

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,600
uh or or even like the most

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,040
up-to-date approach to developing a

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,079
financial core

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,959
um right from the get-go as a

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,560
something that is very easy to deploy um

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,079
very easy to use

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,920
because it has like a very rich um

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:01,200
rest api um and also like finraxian

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,240
with its microservices approach um

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,200
that basically uh

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
when when it started definitely was uh

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
the

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,680
the very buzzword of the future

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,920
um um so

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,680
so yeah i really like the agenda i

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,240
really like the direction that

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,560
that finrak um has finnop community has

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,959
and this is why we have decided to to

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,160
bed up everything on finrac and build

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,360
on top of interact and what i do

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,880
think is that like we're already

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,000
offering a better

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,720
solution than than the biggest

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
vendors out there um what we are

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,040
currently lacking

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,720
is is is more like

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,959
um uh embracing

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
off of those banks like this is

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
something that gabrielle has talked

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,959
about as well

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,079
um getting uh the large corporations to

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,440
to actually

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,560
engage with with open source um and this

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
is something that

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,079
i think we are currently lacking our

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,160
approach

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,519
hypercoars approach is actually going

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,120
for

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:18,880
the non-banks first going for

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,880
the smallest lenders or or financial

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,279
financial institutions out there that

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,959
are currently

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,279
it's a very large market i think it's

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,480
like 30 of the of the

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,680
global um

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,800
of the global assets uh

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,519
being managed and landed over around the

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,720
world

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,560
um so so it's a very large market as

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,920
well and we are starting there

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,839
um and what we are delivering to those

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:54,160
to those corporations are uh basically

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:57,760
automations and rich user experiences

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
which are i think the the direction to

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
go in

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,720
not like get give uh

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,440
the same or or try to compete directly

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,800
with

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,760
uh with those large corporations but

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,560
but just like give the best possible

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,560
solution

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,600
and and yeah provide

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,639
um an alternative way

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,600
that is more open and

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,639
we are hoping to to contribute as much

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,560
as we can

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,600
um it's part of the process as part of

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,600
like us learning the use cases

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,279
yeah that that's very interesting and

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,279
then of course the the the non-banks and

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,480
the small financial institutions are the

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,560
ones that are

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,600
taking the risk to be the the first

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,320
movers on on the open source

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
so sarah

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,320
what do you think that that that we need

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,360
to to

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
to do in order to to be relevant in the

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
next 10 years

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,160
do we need more features do we need to

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,600
decide if it is

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:10,320
finite one dot x or finite cn

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,320
the the roadmap what is your opinion on

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,880
this

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,920
nice to see you guys out here definitely

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,079
we would uh we all would have to uh

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,040
focus on the functionality aspect of

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,600
interact one point

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,399
x i mean which is kind of like a stable

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,680
product

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,600
um which most of the uh

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,480
you know like financial institutions

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,560
would are using right now

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,759
and specifically some banks which i have

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,600
personally

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,160
and which our foundation have worked

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,600
with across the world they

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,360
are they are pretty much interested in

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,440
using so if definitely the feature wise

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
we have to kind of like focus on

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,120
actually like putting a lot of time and

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,320
effort on one point x only

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
cn is not out there so that but cn is

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,160
yet to

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,000
uh grow um we as

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,079
are like a couple of our team members

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
are also working on improving uh

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,360
finraxion

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
um we've already proposed couple of

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,000
solutions out there on the list i mean

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
thanks to james

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
i remember we were having a phone uh

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,880
session a couple of

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,839
days ago for bringing us back to you

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
know like from the

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,680
development side to do the to the actual

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,880
realities

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,240
um so uh definitely features why is

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,839
finrac 1.x

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,839
is well and requires i think couple of

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
more features like for instance you know

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,680
i mean as you guys are

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,720
probably more aware of them what we need

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,759
to have on top of it um

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,040
and like talking about cncn

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,519
the promise of cn is about the

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,600
performance and scalability

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,440
which i i think the the promises

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,000
it can be delivered through finrac one

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
point x also at the same time i mean you

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,199
know like

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
it's not like that it's a big um you

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,720
know kind of a trade-off there happening

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,079
on cn because when we go to the micro

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,040
services stuff

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,720
it's kind of like pulling uh back the

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,000
whole um

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
you know the technical team or the

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,120
operations teams to actually one point x

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,919
because when they realize that there's a

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,319
lot of

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,839
um you know there's a lot of going on

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,160
there um

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,679
and why not we just simply use so it's

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,559
so our approach should be that we need

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,720
to make it

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,959
more simpler i mean i remember working

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,000
back i mean on me force x when it was

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,039
kind of like

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
really um i mean i for you guys to

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
for everybody else to know that i

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,720
actually started working on me for sex

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,320
when it was

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
you know like uh like the fifth

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,080
generation or sixth generation

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
and those times when you know changing

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,960
apis and those things were like a little

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,960
bit different as

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,080
now in apache finra and that journey

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
from last five years has been

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,919
tremendously different you know

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,240
um i've personally like uh developed um

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,080
uh like i mean written thousands of

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,880
lines of code for banks and per

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,400
like financial institutions and uh

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
definitely there is a change but in the

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
next five years what i see is that if we

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,679
focus on a lot of

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,960
streamlined effortless development you

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,880
know like for an instance if somebody

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
wants to kind of like

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,880
create effortless api they just should

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,559
it doesn't really require them to kind

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
of like write a lot lots of code you

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
know

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,640
it shouldn't require them to kind of

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,760
like learn

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
um something new it should be able to

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
happen you know

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,240
on on their existing framework um i

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
think another

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,400
interesting thing which i see is that

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
the integration of the language you know

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,720
different kind of languages

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,280
uh definitely that's happening through

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,320
uh

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,640
rest apis and we don't really need to uh

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,919
sort of like focus on it so one of our

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
talk is actually about

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,080
uh the presentation is about introducing

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,720
encryption from uh

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,200
from a different point of view in in in

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,760
finra

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,520
like so right now security of data

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
privacy is not a part of interactive

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,240
this is

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,160
something which i would personally like

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,080
to see i'm a big proponent of data

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,200
privacy i work with bitcoin and stuff

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,640
so um i mean i put my time there so i

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,080
kind of understand how financial

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,400
institutions

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,320
are sort of like putting their pedal on

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,640
data privacy these days

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,320
so this is where i personally see in the

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
next five years definitely there's a

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,080
bunch of other things which we all can

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,400
kind of like you know imagine

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,720
and future is like endless i mean it's

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,880
not limited to the sky i mean

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,559
you know and we all are sitting in

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
different world and we have experiences

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
of those worlds and when we merge them

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,799
we have finra

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
you know so this is how it is i see in

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,280
the next couple of years

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,480
yeah yeah thank you sir

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:38,760
so um james

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,840
it's been a a long road since

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,039
2002 when you first

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,520
created the white paper and and and

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,280
so what do you think is going to the

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
next 20 years so

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,960
for you i'm proposing an even longer

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,440
shot so

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,000
what for you what is how is going to

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,600
look the next 20 years how is going to

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,840
how would you imagine the next

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,840
generation of this software and this

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
community

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,960
we can't hear you

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
i think we have to uh as we did back

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,799
then try to surf the track

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,280
you see coming um and the big trends

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,240
that we've

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,360
that we saw coming was you know it was a

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
it went from client

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,480
server architectures to cloud to cloud

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
architecture

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
we could see that starting to evolve we

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,000
had we had terrific advisors telling us

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,120
oh that's definitely going to be there

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,039
um and so we designed for that

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,120
and we saw the api movement really take

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,880
off and so we designed for that

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,159
and so what are the trends that we

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
really are

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
need to track now and and i would

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,559
propose there are a few of them one is

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
you know even more ubiquitous

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,000
connectivity

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:57,760
um is going to drive um a lot more

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,640
um applications available to more and

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
more people

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,240
there are still many places in the world

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,000
i mean i know it's not our reality

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
but there's certainly many places in the

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
world where it's hard to get a data

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,559
signal

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
and many people do not have smart

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,400
devices and so

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
you know not everybody's going to have a

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,720
smartphone and they

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,919
and so but they might have data and so

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,840
what does that data

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,280
talk to and so then we have to think

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,600
about what are those

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,200
interfaces that we're going to have so

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,679
those are some of the big trends we have

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,760
to look at

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,679
connectivity being one of them where the

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,960
device is heading

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,720
and then the other thing is is the

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,720
business models and i you know yesterday

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
i talked about the platfins the big

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
financial platforms

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,679
where they do payments and accounts just

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
as

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,400
a necessity a building block not a

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
profit center not a not something that

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,360
they're trying to make money on but an

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,840
underlying thing

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,960
and so that is something that is

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,360
shifting

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,360
you know there are tens of thousands of

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,120
banks globally right now and and

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,880
and all if you count all the small

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,760
credit unions i mean

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,600
there's many many um of these small

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,360
institutions

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,480
but what role do they play when you have

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,880
you know an account on your device and

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
the ability to send payments to anybody

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,080
and you can do that through one of these

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,720
major platforms

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,880
um and you're doing you know and so

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,360
these are the trends we have to look at

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,320
to inform our strategies for where we're

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,600
going

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,679
um so as i look out

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,720
i mean i think one thing one key value

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,039
we need to have

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,480
is reaching out to other projects and

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,720
having a relationship

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,200
with you know for example i think

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,000
identity is a really fundamental

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
building block for financial inclusion

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
and

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,159
financial access there's still plenty of

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,080
people

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,600
in the world even in the united states

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,559
that don't have a bank account there are

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,600
banked and unba

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,000
and under banked populations so we have

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,840
to build

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,600
those connections to other projects like

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,760
identity we shouldn't build

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,159
identity ourselves we should reach out

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,799
to other projects for that

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,679
there's ai and machine learning and

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,080
insights that we can gain

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,760
and and functionality that can be added

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
to finrac

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
and those things can be added by

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,440
reaching out to those

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,480
projects those open source projects to

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,679
bring in you know the federated type of

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,799
um of machine learning

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,480
algorithmic um computation that that

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,039
could really build

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:36,799
um a whole set of new kinds of disruptor

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:39,200
banks and fintechs right and

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,880
uh and so those are two things and then

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,320
i guess the the third thing

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,679
is continue to innovate with the

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,720
the banking industry and help

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,880
them see the value of having

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,679
finrax sit on top of their existing

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,400
stuff i mean so much of the world of

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,559
banking is

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,640
is layers upon layers of systems right i

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,400
mean one of the problems back in

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,000
if i can bring in some ancient history

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,480
one of the problems that i worked on

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
a long time ago was the y2k issue and

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,600
the reason why it was so difficult is

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
that you had cobalt programming that had

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,360
been written in the 60s

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,120
and 70s that was still there it was

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,679
underlying these banking systems

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,799
so banking systems have a lot of layers

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,480
of stuff

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,720
and these things uh may not be clean

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,320
but we have to recognize that they are

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,840
that they're there and so how can

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,000
banks really um innovate well they can

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,279
they can bring in fenrac and finret can

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
be their channel

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,039
can be their their way that they become

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,200
more relevant and innovative

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,400
um in today's world and in fact we're

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,720
already seeing this

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,679
and and i you know from where i said i i

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,120
know which

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,880
global banks are looking at this um and

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,640
which banks are already starting to play

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,159
around with this

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,159
if we could get them to join us openly

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,600
they're kind of doing it in a i think a

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,919
kind of furtive way

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,440
we need to you know get finos and

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,200
gabrielle to tell us

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,960
how are we going to get those big banks

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,400
to to say yeah oh yeah

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,799
we're using open source yep we are um

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,000
that would be a major shift and that

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,320
would bring in

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,640
the kinds of financing and the kinds of

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,600
effort um and concentration

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,559
of of of coding that would really drive

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,520
this forward

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,480
so um that's a long list already i'll

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,000
stop there and

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,080
let's have a discussion well but surfing

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
surfing the the trends it's something

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,919
that it it sounds like uh

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,279
it sounds like a huge uh uh a challenge

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,440
and and and and and how how do you do

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,400
how do you recommend gabrielle came from

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
from

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,320
from the the the the financial sector

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
and the the corporations and the big

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,320
banks

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,520
uh that are openly using open source

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,640
how do we do we uh

00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,360
shall we like propose the road

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,919
or should we listen to them what do you

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,400
recommend us

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
i i thought that james observations were

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,000
were

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,640
absolutely spot on i feel like we are in

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,480
so many

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,840
areas here uh i think one area

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,760
that you guys mentioned that i think

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,919
it's it's really important is

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,159
you're right challenger banks and

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,200
smaller banks and fintechs

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:29,200
are typically a under

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,640
you know i would say more competitive

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,640
uh you know drives to innovate faster

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,480
than maybe the larger banks who have you

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,919
know a lot of legacy as

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,960
james hinted to and you know

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,159
i am a big believer that um

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,039
you know finance like many other

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,279
ecosystems

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,559
should be an open ecosystem it is

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,200
largely

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,360
um you know the value is in the network

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,440
is not necessarily in the code itself

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,480
and so that's actually pleasure and a

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
pain because

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,400
you know on the flip side when you have

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,279
a massive established network

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
then it makes it the much harder to you

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,679
know

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,679
switch to a new software because again

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,159
you get it there it's a cash cow

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,360
it it keeps moving it keeps sort of

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,480
running your business

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,960
so i think the first point is absolutely

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
looking to start from the smaller

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,720
players

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,080
who also potentially don't have massive

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,720
development teams

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,159
like in you know the large corporations

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,720
you know when you have to make a choice

00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
and make or buy and you don't have i

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
don't know

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,679
60 000 developers like my jb morgan

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,000
board member which

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,200
again when i hear that number i'm like

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,679
what do you guys do with 60 000

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,000
i wish i had you know what could we deal

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,159
with if he doesn't develop

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,039
an open source setting if i only could

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,960
have access to

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:56,240
you know 0.1 percent of those 600 people

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,840
will be up to the races but i think one

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,520
angle is certainly starting from the

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,520
smaller ones because

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,720
again as james was saying one of the

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,520
other trends

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
that i'm seeing is look one way or

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,279
another

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,840
both the small and the big uh firms are

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,000
becoming technology companies they want

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,240
to be technology companies

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,520
they realize they're all moving to cloud

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,760
and so

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,880
actually the context that they're moving

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,200
in uh

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,720
also as it belongs to say competing with

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
you know i'm here in the west coast with

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,960
the big tech

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,880
they are you know there are systemic

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,200
drivers for them to innovate faster and

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,720
that's certainly part of why we've seen

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,720
in finance than starting to contribute

00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,799
so i think again just recapping starting

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,279
from the smaller ones

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,120
i think phenos has played a key role in

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,720
creating awareness that is not just

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,640
about consumption i think

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,240
contribution is fundamental and

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,559
we're nowhere nearly there i mean this

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,000
year we have seen probably 70 80 percent

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,279
of our contribution being

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,360
net new projects contributed by banks

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,200
that's great you know there's a lot of

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,960
technology in there of course as james

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
saying not every piece of technology is

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,440
going to be super useful out there in

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,240
the open

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,159
but you know it does open the channel

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,360
for them to understand that there is

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
you know that the value chain uh doesn't

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,480
stop

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,399
at consuming and if you actually consume

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,039
and have to maintain your own copy

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,960
you know what probably better if you go

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,480
proprietary because the cost of

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,960
maintaining your own

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,960
copy of the code and you know keeping

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,440
them pulling from upstream and you know

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,000
it's just

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,679
it just becomes almost defeats the

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,080
purpose of open source

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,000
i think one last angle that we are

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,399
trying this year and i would love to

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,720
hear your your thoughts on this is

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,520
is the angle of engaging with regulators

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,919
um

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,640
i mean we have seen a lot of open

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,200
banking

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
uh sort of taking place sometimes

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,440
mandated by regulators

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,080
but sometimes we're now seeing you know

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,559
again

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,080
there was a mention of apis many of this

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,919
firm are realizing they're actually

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,480
providing api access

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,480
for pay you know not for free it

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
actually is a great way to generate

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,159
incremental revenue

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,000
and you know kind of moving towards more

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,720
this sort of open ecosystem

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,760
again there are drivers that will of

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,000
course

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,760
uh suggest that they want to keep their

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,919
network for themselves

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,000
but we're seeing sort of a glimpse of

00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,880
changes there and so what we started to

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,120
do this year

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,640
is you know engaging with regulators we

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,679
now have a special interest group that

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,960
we're starting

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,200
trying to bring in financial

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,799
institutions right tech companies and

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,840
regulators in the fold

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,039
because i gotta say when i i participate

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,720
to a couple of conferences with

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,960
regulators and

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,039
there's a lot of desire to do the right

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,440
thing when it comes to

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,600
financial inclusion when it comes to

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,600
data privacy

00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,640
it's just really really complex problems

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,000
at the crossroads of you know technology

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,720
and policy and those two

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,760
aspects again i feel like there's a lot

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,120
of desire to do

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,519
good but there's not a clear way to get

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
there

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,720
and what we're trying to position that

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,679
is actually open source

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,760
especially foundations like us we play

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,480
at the crossroads of technology and

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,679
policy

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,640
because you know the the the right

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,440
right the community is as important as

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,480
governing it

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,279
meritocracy you know running a

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,559
blockchain network in a yeah you know

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,399
proper way so

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,320
we're trying to see if there is kind of

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,159
a again going back to the top down and

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,760
bottom up approach we're trying to see

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,279
if we can nurture them both i don't know

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,519
what you guys think about it

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,120
yeah no i mean i look i i talk to

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,640
regulators and development banks on

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,679
almost weekly basis

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,159
and what i can i completely agree

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,760
that there is a willingness to engage

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,799
the fintech community there's a

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,720
willingness

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,120
to talk about what policy changes are

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,159
necessary to encourage innovation

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,080
to protect the public um to build

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,600
you know more publicly oriented

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,960
infrastructure there is

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,880
there is a lot of uh you know a lot of

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
the folks get into that

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,760
those worlds for the public benefit

00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,080
right so they're trying to do things

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,240
that align with the public benefit and

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,279
and i agree it is complex so

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,840
you know you i think one of the issues

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,039
is that

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,279
as fintechs try to approach the

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,880
regulator one at a time

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:38,159
they just have their own sort of um

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,200
you know commercial interest in it when

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
fintech says as an association or as a

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,760
foundation

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,000
like phenos when they approach

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,960
regulators they're speaking on behalf

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,960
of a community of innovation which the

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,039
regulator can then talk to

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,240
because there's there's a really useful

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,000
interface there

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,760
that says look it's not just about one

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,320
commercial interest it's about a public

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,559
good

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,080
that we're trying to create collectively

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,519
so i i think that's important

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,960
and i i also would say that um

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:12,159
you know the the regulations um

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,440
permit quite a lot and there are some

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,159
times when

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,159
i think the fintechs get caught up on

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,799
well i want to do it my way

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,480
and you know there has to be i think

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,840
some flexibility in saying well

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,240
why don't we come up with this

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,919
commercial deal or that commercial deal

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,360
um in order to get to market so um

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,760
it is the environment in which you

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,559
operate and um i think

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,080
that fintechs often come to this with

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,000
well i've got this great idea the

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,880
technology is awesome why don't you let

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,360
me do it

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,120
yeah rather than coming to it with okay

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,960
i have this cool idea

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,799
who can i work with that's going to

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,320
allow me to get to market

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,240
and i think that's a switch and

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,640
mentality that has to happen as well

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,840
now you're absolutely right i mean the

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,080
i'm gonna

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,039
let the other panelists chime in but i

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,000
just want to say

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,960
you know they say that adding a level of

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,600
indirection

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,000
solves half of the problems of computer

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,159
science

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
now so actually we are noticing that

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,760
it's much easier for us

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,359
to work with regulators than directly

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,399
even financial institutions

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,440
and one final comment is and maybe

00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,679
for for for later conversations

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,480
but what i've seen is that also the

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,480
fintechs to your point

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,760
you know you say banks are not familiar

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,280
with open source

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,200
but i gotta say i've had many examples

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,119
of fintechs that you would expect them

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,159
to be you know innovative the new kids

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,399
on the block

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,879
sort of understanding how a commercial

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,720
open source model would work

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,639
i've seen a very similar lack of

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,440
understanding of how

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,320
authentic can actually make an open core

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,440
play

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,119
um you know their business model so i

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,200
don't know if there's an education there

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,920
on that side as well you know maybe some

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,440
of them are just ex-bankers

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,000
with the hoodie i don't know but uh it's

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,079
certainly

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,680
certainly been an aspect that i i would

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,119
have expected more maturity in the

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,240
fintech communities when it comes to

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,839
open source

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,599
yeah yeah yeah

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,599
i think a lot of uh what you're

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,400
referring to is

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,480
also acting in in the current world so

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,359
like for example if we're looking at

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,160
fintechs that are in the payment um

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,240
segment

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,200
in payment segment um there is

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,720
not a lot of ways to do liquidation that

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,400
doesn't involve

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:40,560
um swift for example so

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,560
like in in and i think you you are

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,760
you're making a very valid point where

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,040
you're saying

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,160
james actually you were saying that

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,640
the foundations actually play a really

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,480
big role in trying to

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,000
connect all of those different

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,280
organizations i do think that

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,480
like in the future part of the

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,320
part of the expectations um from

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,400
from those foundations and from the

00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,680
organizations that are actually

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,240
um governing open source uh

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,359
um would be to to connect with the

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,000
different

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,839
organizations and and i've actually had

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,960
very good experience with that with me

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,359
first because

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,440
uh ed actually has introduced me to to

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,960
javier i think or even

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,400
maybe maybe was morale before uh um

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,640
even before that um but yeah i do think

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,320
that there are

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,920
um that's things like that

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:46,480
things like um trying to find

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:50,240
um alternative liquidity uh

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,520
systems or trying to create

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,760
networks payment networks or even

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,040
you know uh we we are talking about like

00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,520
bureaus of

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,280
credit bureaus or open credit viewers

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,720
like things like that

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,040
are um should definitely be something

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,079
that

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,200
the community organizes for

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,240
its own benefits basically so so my way

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,040
of thinking

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,920
of this whole thing is like um an open

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,480
source community

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:24,400
should not only create um

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,640
code that is um later deployed

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,839
however you would like but also create

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,280
services

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,960
um that are that the community can

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,160
um consume so so we've actually done

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,040
something on that regard um with finrac

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,400
as a service

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,320
just like um providing that to

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,480
back to the community everyone can just

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,000
like go in and

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,119
like fire up their own instance

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,680
but the goal there was to to

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,240
basically try to learn how how to

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,000
provide such a service to the community

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,400
um and maybe even take that much further

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,520
so

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,000
so i'm thinking about like um

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,920
doing provisioning of of and

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,040
orchestrations of those

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,240
uh of of the different organizations

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,599
so that we could all um learn from that

00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,400
or even have like

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,359
even like get a good sandbox environment

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,440
basically

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,800
um for for for testing various things

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,599
um yeah and i think like mifos has

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,200
has been delving into into mojo loop

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,400
which is

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,280
very a very important project as well

00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,240
i i would love to hear like what do you

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,359
think

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,440
um finrac community

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,720
in general could do to maybe introduce

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,079
mojo loop as

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,079
as a service yeah

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,119
yeah so let me put on my mefos hat for a

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,280
bit um

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,599
just to give a quick synopsis of that

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,440
there's a whole talk about that later on

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,720
but essentially mojo loop is an open

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,440
source switch that the

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,119
bill and melinda gates foundation funded

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,800
it's now an independent foundation

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,359
funded by google and the gates

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,320
foundation and omidyar

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,760
network and others and so it's the

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,960
payment switch it's the connective

00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,000
tissue

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,280
um finrak is the account system

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,359
and the banking system and then mephos

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,960
has built a payments hub in between

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,560
that's also open source

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,800
and you can get all of that um and so

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,320
by putting all of those together i agree

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,359
david we we could

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,800
we and we plan to see that as kind of a

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,839
provisioned

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:43,040
um set of tools for

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,760
um a government to see how this could

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,960
work

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,880
or multiple banks or you could see how

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
that could connect your existing banking

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,320
system so we do have you know we have

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,680
broad plans for that and i think that's

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,320
part of our building block

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,480
for the future so payments i think are

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,240
super important and i'm sorry if i

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,520
i'm taking too much time but payments

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,240
are really a driver

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,119
right we started with microfinance as

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,240
like

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,880
um an intervention with people in

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,440
villages

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,480
meeting an unmet need of credit and

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,440
savings

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,160
but payments drive so much of day-to-day

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,280
life

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,920
and if so if you can drive

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,079
payments onto finrac and these open

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,960
source payment systems um

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,920
and the way you do that is by having

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,680
again

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,280
these trends around qr codes and

00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,319
innovative things around payment

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,480
initiation and the europeans with the

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,599
psd2 and you know these things i talked

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,280
about yesterday

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,800
these things are driving payments

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,119
innovation i mean this is the most

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,839
innovative time in the payments industry

00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,200
in the last 30 years for sure and it's a

00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,560
massive change

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,200
and so being a part of that means

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,280
building that complete stack and so

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
we're working on that and i i think that

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,000
that

00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,800
one of my points around connecting to

00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,240
other projects

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,319
like finra does not have to do

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,440
everything thinner out can stay really

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,760
focused on

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,680
getting the core banking systems right

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,839
getting security i agree with sranj

00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,680
security and data privacy embedded into

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,920
the logic

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,520
and then these other systems these other

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,640
open source projects can have their own

00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,240
energy their own

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,880
set of users and this componentization

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,000
of this

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,680
really i think helps um and

00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,520
you know again payments are driving a

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,960
lot of innovation and i

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,560
i guess i would i would also like to

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,359
plug one more payments innovation and

00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,599
that is

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,440
the the biometric cards and the and the

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,440
sort of the online offline

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,520
things that are coming along and i i

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,400
guess i'm really just attracted to this

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,280
idea because i

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,839
i like the idea of people being in

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,160
charge of their own

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:53,520
um their own financial account

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,480
um and and having it widespread so

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,760
um anyway i'll stop on on that i think

00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,040
that there's quite a lot yeah

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,880
to digest so i would like to

00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,200
to the community yes go ahead

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,200
so i would like to go and on the same

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,880
parts of what james has said the

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,640
payment is the most important thing i

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,640
remember working with this us bank

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,480
a couple of months ago while we were

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,640
integrating uh the platform

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,680
which when right and you know the

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,240
regulation was something a big hurdle

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,760
we had to kind of like twist our way

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,440
around

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
and this is where things go a little bit

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,800
you know here and there

00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,119
when you come from the payments you know

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,720
in rails it's kind of like becoming

00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,240
complicated actually so i think we kind

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,160
of have to accept the fact that we have

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,079
to

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,000
sort of prototype it next couple of

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,040
years or focus on

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,200
how do we efficiently um put this

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,560
up with payment trails like together

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,640
like

00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,319
so that it's not an external part

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,040
anymore

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,079
but rest assured finrac works really

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,880
amazing

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,119
we've seen it working with from zero to

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,359
you know thousands of transactions

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,440
so it's a it's a best open source code

00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:09,599
banking system out there right now

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,480
i mean there is none actually i remember

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,560
when i when i

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,040
kind of like went on a google looking

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,200
for open source for banking stuff

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,800
so like other two projects which don't

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,599
even exist now anymore

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,359
so yeah so payments and regulation is

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,880
definitely something which we also the

00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,160
teams you know look for

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,520
out and we devise different ways to kind

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,599
of like accommodate with

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,640
different kind of regulations so imagine

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,400
like you know you have

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,200
a bunch of uh as debits david said that

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,640
instance is firing up instances so you

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,599
could fire up an instance

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,280
like in philippine and you have these

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,319
regulations and payment trails

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,920
you know baked inside together and

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,520
anybody who wants to use those api

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,960
directly could use those apis

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:59,760
you know so such kind of uh future i

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,760
envision thank you thank you xavier

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:05,760
welcome so um we have time

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,160
uh the next session is in 30 minutes so

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,400
we can i i don't want to stop this panel

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,400
i

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,400
don't know if you have time i'll i'm

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,319
enjoying it really really much so

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:19,440
we can go um so i i want to

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,280
throw a question to the to the groups in

00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,280
terms of

00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,560
being relevant one of the most important

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,880
things and i saw

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,560
one of the keynotes before is it's

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,000
having a mission you know

00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:36,240
a a conveying mission to attract people

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,599
and and and of course uh generating uh

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,119
a big business it's not a

00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,240
a conveying mission to bring volunteers

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,800
so and and and solving the poverty

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,480
it's it's it's it's it's it's one of the

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,520
biggest mission and it's

00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,960
mission but what about finra what what

00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,680
is the finrak mission

00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,440
uh can we borrow mythos mission we need

00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,280
to have another mission

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,640
what what we need to have for the next

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,880
10 years to

00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,680
to convey and attract talent and

00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,680
collaborators

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,319
um you know i guess that's that's a very

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,640
ripe question

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,079
javier i i like i like where you're

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,319
going um

00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,839
yeah i mean finrax mission does not need

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,119
to be miphos's mission

00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,200
and you know mifo's contributed the code

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,319
with the intention of finrac being a

00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,440
broader based

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,520
set of players right so

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,760
mifos remains committed to financial

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,760
inclusion open source

00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,200
um you know poverty reduction finrac

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,240
um is really about

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:50,079
the financial sector and

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,440
um so there's there's plenty of room

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,640
for for that to evolve as a mission

00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:00,079
and i i did try um

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,359
on a blog post on the finrac uh wiki

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,200
to articulate a vision and a mission

00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:07,839
what i would love is if there are others

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,640
with similar kinds of ideas or different

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,160
visions

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,000
to post there and to have a

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,680
rich discussion about what should be

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,680
that that vision

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,400
but i guess what i would say is that the

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,040
vision is

00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,720
commoditization of financial systems

00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:31,040
such that more and more

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:35,200
value can be uh retained by the end user

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,599
so banking is extractive

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,599
can we make it less extractive by

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,040
bringing the commoditization of the back

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,839
end to bear

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,839
and so if we can do that if we can build

00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,160
because commoditization

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,280
is the thing that open source does

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,440
really well

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,640
it it makes things because you're

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,400
getting all these different people

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,440
collaborating on the comments it builds

00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,000
the commons

00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,599
and so that drives commoditization which

00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
drives down the cost

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,640
and it and it provides a price signal

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,640
like

00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,400
really i'm gonna spend five million

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,760
dollars on this banking system and i can

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,040
download it over here

00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,560
for free i mean again open source is not

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,560
about free

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,880
so i don't want to confuse people but it

00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,240
is one of those values that i think that

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,640
we can talk to about

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,480
is open source it drives commoditization

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,280
and combined with cloud technology it

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,040
really and this is why articode is

00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,200
you know your provisioning ideas and how

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,520
you've done that are so important

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,680
um and so that you know i think that's

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,559
the that's the vision or the mission

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,559
right now

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,400
um but i i would love to have more

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,400
people get involved in that disc

00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,800
yeah definitely um i i do think that

00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,000
thinner act

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,520
as you've said has its own

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,200
uh motto um and and i do appreciate that

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,720
the fact that before has

00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,520
um contributed that to apache by like

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,160
seeing that the apache foundation with

00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,280
its

00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,480
track record um could actually

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,119
create the commodity commoditization

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,240
um or or bring freedom act to be a

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,920
commodity

00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:18,319
um and

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,359
what i would like to to suggest is

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,960
actually um

00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:28,000
uh is actually pushing that forward for

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,920
um we want uh

00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,280
finner act to be uh

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,640
basically the core that you don't need

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,280
or or the core that uh that you don't

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,640
need to

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,119
to invest too much in um in order to

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,160
start

00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:50,400
building um and in that sense

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,520
it's not just um having that

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,559
uh a copy of the of the code to be to be

00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:00,240
able for you to run on your own but then

00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:03,280
um having that um available for you

00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:07,280
when you need it um as a service

00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,640
or i would go even further for for like

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,760
a serverless

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,040
um approach where very

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,800
this would only run when you need it

00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:23,520
uh just in time basically um

00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:26,559
and i i don't have like the

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,559
the right way to

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,200
to articulate for a vision but but

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:36,160
that's what i would like to

00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,160
be the the core values basically

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,960
what do you think a real it's a it's a

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,200
a vision or mission that that the open

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,920
service community has to have

00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,839
that's i mean i'm learning a lot from

00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,319
this conversation so first of all thank

00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,839
you for

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:55,200
for involving me but um i told you that

00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,680
was one of the reasons why

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,119
i was here to learn a lot so i hope this

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,640
is actually just the beginning of

00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,640
conversation

00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,079
um across the different communities

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,800
because you're absolutely right i mean

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,880
we are

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,040
starting conversations with mojolope

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,240
we've had conversations with with miphos

00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,520
of course we

00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,920
you know we can represent um several

00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,400
people and i think i mean the point of

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,400
you know it kind of got me thinking on

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,720
uh the differences between apache and a

00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,960
more vertical foundation again i'm a big

00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,119
fan of apache this is not about about

00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,400
competing in any way is actually about

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,280
bringing people together but

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,920
i can now see much more clearly how you

00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,680
know

00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,200
you know horizontal foundation like

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,920
apache and again

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,839
kind of going back to the grassroots you

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,520
know

00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,160
very uh focused sort of

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,800
um putting forward the values of open

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,960
source and

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,559
and how you're supposed to open source

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,480
actually it could be very complementary

00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,880
to a much more vertical foundation like

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,280
us where we can be stewards of

00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,920
you know much more financial services

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,920
specific conversations around

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,960
you know with the regulators with with

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,200
the big banks

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,760
and and so on and so forth but back back

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:09,599
to your question i think

00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,119
to me it's a combination of in my mind

00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,760
open source and one thing

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,839
that actually really helped me in my

00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,280
pitches to to banks over the last five

00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,040
years is that

00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,319
what we're trying to do here is not a

00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,920
zero-sum game

00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,839
it is a positive sum game meaning

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,480
yes there is the aspect of cost

00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:30,960
reduction and open source commoditizes

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,640
you know something that candidly i think

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,960
we we all think

00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,000
it's known differentiating um you know i

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,720
i would argue that

00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,720
60 70 percent of the software if not 80

00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,720
90 percent of the software that run

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,760
into a large financial institution it's

00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,240
non-differentiating all of them have the

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,559
same

00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,280
regulator implementation being one

00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:54,720
example of that um

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,000
but you know i think the other angle is

00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,680
exactly what uh

00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,520
i think i don't know who was mentioning

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,960
it but this wasn't kind of lost but

00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,000
um it's the value for the end users uh

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,880
i think we gotta combine those two

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,720
drivers yes of course the way you get a

00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,280
big financial institution even a smaller

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,480
one

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,119
at the table is yeah let's start with

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,480
with uh uh you know cost reduction and

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,359
open source allows you

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,240
you know tactical gain come and use the

00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,599
software

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,359
hopefully that will trigger you

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,559
contributing back because as we were

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,319
saying before it's going to cost you

00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,839
more to maintain it your own

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:34,960
but on the flip side i think when it

00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,000
comes to strategic level at these firms

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,480
you know i i

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,040
have the honor to talk with ctos and

00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,760
cios of these large banks

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,200
what actually they are going for is a

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,440
better user experience

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,119
that's what they're trying they're

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,319
feeling in a way

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,720
somewhat threatened by by the fintechs

00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:57,359
and again

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,040
i don't necessarily like to use fear as

00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:02,240
a

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,200
uh factor to move things along but

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,000
certainly fear

00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,680
is a big is a big driver for people to

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,960
move and act and so

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,880
i guess what i'm trying to say here

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,440
there is a combination of

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,400
that your typical open source benefits

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,480
that i think we're all

00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,079
aware of in terms of cost reduction

00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,520
talent acquisition

00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,119
you know some of these banks are really

00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,800
looking at that strategically

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,839
but i think ultimately what is going to

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,240
drive them to actually make the loop the

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:29,359
leap

00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,520
and i don't know how this directly

00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,960
correlates to the vision the thinner

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,079
finrax should have but

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,640
i think what is actually going to

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,839
ultimately drive them to to

00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:42,319
uh make the leap is

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,440
you know they are able to offer a

00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,720
superior or

00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,400
comparable user experience to what we're

00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,880
seeing many of these new fintechs coming

00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,880
up

00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,880
are able to offer the mobile native

00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,599
generation again i go back to the trends

00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,040
that that

00:53:53,599 --> 00:54:00,720
james says so so well uh elaborated on

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,319
so i again i might not have a super

00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,760
clear answer to your question around

00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,720
vision and mission

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,240
but i think as we work together as

00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,520
adjacent communities

00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:14,720
finra finos mojo lope uh

00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,680
um mythos and many others that are

00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,319
trying to do

00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,160
something around this area i think maybe

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,839
the best way is looking at the

00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,000
big picture together and then divide and

00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,400
conquer

00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,599
where can you guys you know what's your

00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,040
bread and butter

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,200
what's our bread and butter how can we

00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,440
coordinatedly

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,119
you know work to i think get to a vision

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,480
that is very much shared

00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,640
the more the more i talk to you guys so

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,280
sorry if that wasn't necessarily exactly

00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:45,359
the answer i i didn't come up with a

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,319
vision and mission statement for finra

00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,480
for the last

00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,640
the next 10 years but i hope we can

00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,119
continue the conversation and

00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,839
you know we're still learning ourselves

00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,839
uh

00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,119
uh we are now in a very different phase

00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,520
where we were three years ago

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,160
banks are contributing we're looking at

00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,000
sort of

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,760
core business problems in the industry

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,559
payments keep coming up

00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,559
um you know we are he's starting more on

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,079
the investment banking side but we're

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,400
looking very much to

00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,240
you know apply our successes and our

00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,559
lessons learned to retail

00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,640
so i hope this you know together we can

00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,720
figure out what the best vision

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:23,920
uh what's the best mission for us to get

00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,920
to the common vision is

00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,920
does that make sense it yeah well it

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,599
makes sense to me

00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,119
um i i think i also would like to plug

00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,839
um just how amazing the community is

00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,440
already

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,599
and so i think if we think about the

00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,240
vision for finrak into the future

00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,520
we want to build on that we already have

00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,599
i think one of the most

00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,400
global dispersed

00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,559
varied community anywhere on apache i

00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,520
mean we have high school students to

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,799
senior developers we have people with

00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,160
skills

00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,839
up and down the ladder we and and

00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,200
from all over the world from many

00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:06,000
different um

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,200
countries with with very different um

00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,119
life experiences

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,319
and i i think that we're just simply

00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,880
richer

00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,480
um as a result of that so i think that's

00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,520
a vision as well that we want to

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,359
encourage and maintain

00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:23,359
our diversity it's awesome we have

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,480
i don't i don't know about the other

00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:27,440
projects but

00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,280
i don't know about fit sorry features

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,280
i'll say but

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,200
because we have also diversity but our

00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,200
diversity as a company is

00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,319
it's mainly because of the diversity of

00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,160
the funeral community because we

00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:45,520
we got most of our our team members from

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:48,400
from the community so if it's

00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:49,920
if if if our if my company it's a sample

00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,880
of the community

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,160
i i would say that we have an incredible

00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
diverse community

00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,400
incredibly diverse and that is it's it's

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,960
it's it's a it's a

00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,240
it's powerful it's very powerful one of

00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,640
the things that i'm

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:08,000
i'm going back to your first comment

00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,119
james on on on

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
surfing trends and and figuring out

00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,640
why we walk and it's something that i am

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,040
very

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,839
very interested in and and i'm i'm not

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,480
seeing a lot

00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,400
of this in the in the finale community

00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,440
it's about blockchain

00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:26,319
so what about blockchain how we can it

00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,680
because

00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:32,000
if it's going to be the the next thing

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:35,200
or it is the next thing

00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,720
banking it's you know

00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:41,200
banks are a very expensive database

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,079
now because physical money it's no

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:45,200
longer

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:48,480
it's no longer relevant

00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,319
at least in in in the big

00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,720
maybe in the financial inclusion it is

00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,400
but physical money it's just a tiny

00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,280
percentage of all the transactions in

00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,880
the world

00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:01,680
and and and and banks are basically

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,599
for me and very expensive database and

00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,880
and now we have a better database which

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,839
is blockchain

00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,200
so what we need to do in the finra

00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:12,640
community

00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,400
or if any anything we need to do to

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,640
to serve this new trend what do you

00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,640
think

00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,839
nobody wants to well okay i mean i was

00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,960
waiting for somebody else to jump in but

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:32,799
you know i'll go ahead um

00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,440
so look um distributed transaction

00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,200
ledgers

00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:40,480
are um are useful

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:43,599
when you have certain use cases and

00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,920
i i i think we get a little too

00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,119
um attracted by the shining object the

00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,000
shiny object

00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,240
um you know byzantium fault tolerance is

00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,799
wonderful but why do you need it

00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,920
um and so if you have trusted domains

00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:59,520
and you have trust

00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,240
if you have trust kinds of frameworks

00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:04,720
that exist and they work

00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,680
then why do you need why do you really

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,720
need this

00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,839
in many cases i think it is a technology

00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,640
in search of a

00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:15,040
of a product or a market right now that

00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:18,160
is not to say that we shouldn't

00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,760
you know encourage adoption and and

00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,720
figure things out i mean i'm

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,040
i'm all for let's let's explore right i

00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,680
think

00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,960
the way mojo loop has attracted uh or

00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,280
dealt with this

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:30,480
is they've built into the mojo loop is

00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,000
the payments thing

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:37,599
it they've built in um a connection

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,400
to uh a dtl um

00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:42,400
and um they've done that by having an

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,359
interledger tokenization

00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,319
for every transaction so they can talk

00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:49,359
to

00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:52,559
a standard ledger or they can talk to

00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:54,240
a uh a blockchain ledger and so

00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:56,079
i think in the same way if we could

00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,599
bring that sort of pattern into

00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:00,000
benarak if we could you know perhaps

00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,319
somebody

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,280
could take this and work on this as a

01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,000
project

01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,119
is build the underlying ledger that we

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,920
have

01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,720
using um that to see if we get

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,599
performance

01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,839
let's see if we can get better

01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,920
performance out of it i mean we could

01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,960
start with for example the the ripple

01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,960
brd

01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,000
or you know one of these existing wallet

01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,440
types and

01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,040
see if we could we could build some of

01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,960
the functionality on top of it

01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,400
i i'm not convinced that's going to get

01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,520
us much i mean

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:32,240
if you don't need it um

01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,720
to get good you know i'm just not sure

01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,079
but i

01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,440
but i think we should somebody if

01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,559
somebody wants to do it that's the

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,359
wonderful thing about an open source

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,400
project

01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:43,119
propose the idea bring it on list

01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,160
start working on it get people bought

01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,240
into your vision and

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,520
let's see if it gets accepted maybe it's

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,079
like a separate

01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,760
repo maybe it's something that gets

01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,480
instantiated at run time

01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,160
um i don't know somebody who's got the

01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,720
skills could do this i

01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,480
you know uh i would love to see you know

01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:03,280
people discuss this but i

01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,400
but i think again um as somebody has

01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,599
told me

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:09,839
um what was the quote it's um if you

01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,160
if you don't have trust issues then um

01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:14,240
then blockchain's just a

01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:15,359
just a database just poorly designed

01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,000
database

01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,359
um yeah i think i'm getting the i'm

01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,160
getting the quote wrong

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:23,440
so um but anyway uh that's that's where

01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,599
i stand on it i'm

01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,359
happy to entertain discussion i love the

01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,599
idea

01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:30,400
yeah that's actually something that i

01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,200
was

01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,040
i really wanted to add is that like

01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,240
there are conditions where

01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:41,599
there is no trust um so i can see

01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:44,160
the use case um or that be

01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,880
like the use case where you don't have

01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,559
trust

01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:52,559
which is maybe um between

01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:56,079
different uh countries um

01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,359
maybe like so like maybe following the

01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,400
ripple idea

01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:03,760
where yeah or the xrp um

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:06,799
where if you want to do global payments

01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,160
um do it on on on the ripple account but

01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:11,119
that but on there

01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,240
it's more it's more centralized and

01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,920
decentralized

01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,460
um really so um what i would suggest

01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,599
is that um

01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,880
[Music]

01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:24,960
places where you don't have trust um

01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,599
could definitely

01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,799
utilize this technology and i'm thinking

01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,319
of like what you've

01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:35,359
uh what you've said james uh as part of

01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:36,960
the agenda of uh mifos maybe it's

01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,160
something you should consider like

01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:44,240
uh there are places where

01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:47,359
where there are trust issues um

01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:51,359
is something like that could be a good

01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:54,799
like a fitting um use case or

01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:58,480
is that too far-fetched or too

01:02:54,799 --> 01:03:02,720
like stretching that this this idea of

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,200
you know distributed database

01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,880
well i i mean again i think we could we

01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,799
could also combine these technologies i

01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,319
mean for example you could have wallets

01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,680
that are based on

01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:16,799
or identities based on um blockchain

01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:19,760
um and you those that could provide

01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:21,359
an input into the system you know that

01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,160
that gets you into that space without

01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:25,440
having to

01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,920
to change the back end um i'm just not

01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,880
sure that the back end needs to be

01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,359
you know a dlt um maybe the front end

01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,200
wallet

01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:35,680
maybe there's like a maybe there's like

01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,599
a thing that sits on a on a phone or

01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:41,520
um you know on a card um

01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,520
and you know then then we're getting

01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,400
into and an identity again

01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,599
identity i think is a good one for for

01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,079
potentially

01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:51,520
for this i mean who knows again it has

01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,480
to do with the trust networks

01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:55,440
there's already plenty of um trust

01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,520
networks out there

01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,799
that work right so the internet is a

01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,920
trust network

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,559
we're we're here because the dns servers

01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,359
trust

01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,240
certain certificates and you know we we

01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:09,680
understand that

01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,440
so um anyway i uh

01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,799
i actually just noticed that my battery

01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,559
is running low

01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,000
i've only got another bike yes and we

01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,160
are way over time away from the time

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,440
yeah but i i'm really enjoying this

01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,119
conversation

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,839
i just don't have the real comments on

01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,720
that um first of all i cannot say the b

01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:30,559
word i have to say dlt because in my

01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,000
world blockchain is still a

01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:37,920
no no word no kidding kidding aside

01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,480
kidding aside um i think the element the

01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,280
the you know the point on trust is very

01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,520
spot-on

01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,520
and i'm not entirely sure as much as i

01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,160
think it should be a building block

01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,880
of creating trust you know technology

01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,920
can help

01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,119
create trust but for what i have

01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,640
experienced

01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,240
you know trust is something that sort of

01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,160
exhausts i don't know how to say that

01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:03,119
but that it's uh beyond

01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,400
just technology meaning it took us five

01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,960
years to build

01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,400
some degree of trust between these

01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,200
institutions

01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,839
that a it was trust towards us again

01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,079
it's a small

01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,960
much smaller problem quote unquote but

01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,920
it's like

01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,799
they trusted us they entrusted us with

01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,880
their code

01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:22,319
and most importantly they they trusted

01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,039
each other that

01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,400
you know sure everyone contributes for

01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:28,319
especially if you're a corporate

01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,079
everyone contributes to drive their own

01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,599
technology interest but again it's a

01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,400
positive sum game

01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,440
you're helping the community while

01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,839
helping yourself

01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,119
that that that is the the fundamental

01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,920
point and so

01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:43,359
i've seen so many of these blockchain

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,480
projects

01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:48,720
failing to go to production often

01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,920
because of the lack of a

01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:54,640
an actual overlaying trust framework

01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,799
on the technology uh do the companies

01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:59,839
trust each other is there a governance

01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:01,760
network you know because as a fund

01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,760
you know as the idea of a foundation of

01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:06,319
course we do a lot of governance and

01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,200
and you know and and policies but it's

01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,760
around

01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,640
code contributions it's not around how

01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:14,400
you

01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:17,280
run and operate uh a trust network so

01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,039
again i i my only caveat is i think the

01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,440
technology is is very interesting i

01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:22,480
think

01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:26,000
you know uh providing

01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:28,079
i think that idea of of a a switch or a

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,400
transparent layer of compatibility with

01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,640
the

01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:33,599
old la you know traditional ledgers and

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:37,599
distributor ledger is a great idea

01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:40,640
but i fear that you we would need some

01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,119
other sort of trust construct to be able

01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,640
to

01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,640
actually bring these pieces of

01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,760
technology from

01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:49,760
behind the scenes pilots across three or

01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,039
four organizations that never really

01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,920
make it out there

01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,119
uh to actually you know a network that

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,920
we all trust like

01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,799
again akin to the internet so just just

01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,720
a comment there that i don't know i i'm

01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,160
i don't know that technology can change

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,440
people's people

01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,440
change people's typically

01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,200
about trust trust is a thing that you

01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,319
gain

01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,119
grain per grain but you lost kilo per

01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:20,880
kilo

01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:24,000
right away exactly exactly

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:27,280
so um thank you

01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,760
david gabriel james

01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,640
you lost syracha but thank you for for

01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,839
this

01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:35,200
wonderful conversation i really really

01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:37,920
enjoyed i hope that

01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,720
the audience already enjoyed it too he's

01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,359
going to be

01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,480
in the in youtube on the apachecon

01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:45,599
channel too

01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,160
so thank you for your time uh

01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,839
let's continue this conversation in the

01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,119
various of a feather

01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:57,839
later today i i welcome you there
