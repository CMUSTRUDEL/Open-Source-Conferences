The public square needs open source for payments, banking, identity and financial inclusion. Fortunately, a number of projects, some new, some old are there to provide a stack for payments and banking for everyone on the planet. We’ll survey some recent developments in Fineract, Mifos Payment Gateway, Mojaloop, and related technologies around auth, identity, and put it together with announcements around open G2P, open Banking, CBDC, and open ID. We'll get into tech enablers like biometrics on a secure device. We’ll put together a stack of technology built on Fineract, and demonstrate what might be possible. From remittances to self-sovereign identity, we’ll explore how these new trends intersect with specific technologies. Low cost, cloud, offline device enabled, the future is open.

James Dailey is the Board Chair and founder of Mifos, the open source community that created and then contributed the fineract code base. He works at the intersection of financial inclusion and energy inclusion in the global south. A serial entrepreneur, James has created several social ventures and open source projects, aimed at solving big hairy problems. He sits on the fineract PMC and helps with identifying gaps and strategies.
