my sound levels are good let me know if

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,560
i'm speaking too softly

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,000
um so i think uh what i want to do is go

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
through a series of questions and i'm

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
gonna

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,720
ask one of you and if if you have a

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
another response please you know jump

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
right in and we'll we'll make this a

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,799
dynamic dialogue uh and

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,159
uh so i think my first question is um

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
what is finrac um there might be a lot

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
of

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
differences of opinions but uh i think

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,239
at a core we can define it

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,799
um and i'm going to ask uh

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,720
ed to jump in with a definition of of

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
finrac

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
okay thanks james and thank you javier

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,599
for bringing us all

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
together today looking forward to this

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,280
panel so

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720
you know at its core you know i would

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
say finrac is a

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
open source core banking platform and so

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,439
we had its origins and being able to

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,840
manage the back offices of

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
traditional microfinance institutions

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,479
and now we're managing

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
you know digital banks that don't have

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,960
any back office so it provides all of

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,960
those core capabilities to actually run

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,120
a bank whether it's digital or brick and

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,000
mortar so that is you know creating

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,080
customers

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
creating accounts managing a portfolio

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,960
of loan products savings products

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,479
and now you know finrac is continuing to

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
evolve to actually integrate with

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,560
real-time payment systems

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,880
provide a suite of interfaces to allow

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
omni-channel banking experiences

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,080
so if you're a fintech if you're a

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,080
financial institution

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,759
you know finrac can serve as this open

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,560
source core banking platform

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,759
to manage your end-to-end operations so

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
at a high level i'll leave it at that

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
change yeah that's great

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,039
um javier uh i think your company is

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,160
is involved in using finrac can you say

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,840
something about what

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,479
that's like so um

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,639
for us finrak it's a it's a it's a

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,600
platform for innovation you know

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,720
it makes uh we work with fintechs all

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,160
over the world

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
and and and finra it's a great platform

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,639
for

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,280
for for field takes and for startups to

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,880
start at the same level of the

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
competition so

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,880
like five years or two years ago if you

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
wanted to start a financial institution

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,160
from scratch

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,520
you needed to invest hundreds if not

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,880
millions of dollars

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
in technology now you need you can do

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,560
that

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,560
basically for a fraction of that

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,600
and that will allow and it's allowing a

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
lot of innovation

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,759
on the financial space and that is what

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,039
is exciting for us to work with

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
finnerdag because

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,639
uh it allows innovators it allows

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,080
entrepreneurs

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,520
and also it allows the the the the

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,120
the people that is working and the

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,080
financial institutions to quickly

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
innovate

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,680
and to quickly work on things that they

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,600
they

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,840
they used they didn't were able to

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,440
to test before because the cost of

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,199
testing was so high

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,880
if you're working in a bank or in a

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,440
financial institution with their core

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
banking traditional power banking

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,280
changing anything in the core banking

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,479
it's very expensive and

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,440
it's very time resourcing and doing that

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
is as a side project with finrac it it

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
it is

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,240
almost inexpensive for for more

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,280
financial institutions so

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,240
for us finra it's a platform to

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,720
to innovate and to sit on top of it and

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,720
to

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
generate the next level of innovations

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,039
terrific thank you javier

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,000
michael um how does this project differ

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
from other

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
open source projects that you've been

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
involved in and you've got a long list

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,639
of

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,759
open source projects that you've been uh

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
engaged in so

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
how is this different yeah i'm gonna

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,319
have to

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,520
add the community aspect here of course

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
agreeing with everything that ed and

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,280
javier you were saying

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,039
but um for me personally what really

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,319
distinguishes finra from other open

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,680
source communities

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
um is that um it's a very vibrant

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,800
community right

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,639
we have got people from all walks of

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,680
life from all over the world

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,880
that contribute to this platform um

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,440
coming to this group

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,280
with different experiences different

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,120
motivations also

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,319
for weather participating but all coming

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
together around

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,199
a community where each brings their part

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,479
to the to the table i think what is

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
particularly different from other open

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,000
source communities is

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,000
the variety of backgrounds the

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,479
geographical diversity

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
um the longevity also we've been around

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,560
for a while right

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,479
um or existed from way before apache

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,199
finnoac was incubated

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,520
um i have people i met uh 10 years ago

00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
that

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,000
i'm in touch with today through finra

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,360
act and um i think that's a

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,800
a great aspect of this project thank you

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
um yeah just james dad on top of what

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,440
both

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,199
javier and michael said you know echoing

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,479
what javier said we really

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
you know and this goes back to the

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,879
vision you had from day one so really

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
believe

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
that core banking software should become

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,319
commoditized so there is that common set

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
of functionality

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,000
everybody can collaborate around and as

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
javier said it really is a platform for

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
innovations for others to

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,520
to build on top of and then adding to

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,760
what michael said you know i think

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,519
what he noted about the dynamism and the

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,440
vibrancy of our community is both an

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,120
opportunity and a challenge as we have

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,399
contributors from all walks of life

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
working in our community

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,080
and we've got commercial companies you

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
know interns high school students

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,920
and so it's neat to see them all come

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,760
together for this common vision

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,760
and i think it's you know unique dynamic

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
that we bring to apache and we have

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
this end user community as well that's

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,080
collaborating on top of this project

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,080
which is

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,680
something unique to us that we're eager

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,680
to share the lessons we've

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,399
had over the years too yeah i i i i

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,920
don't want to

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,720
get too far into this conversation

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,399
without saying yes it is an amazing

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,200
um set of people involved and we have

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,959
we have people um as had mentioned high

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,160
schoolers coming to the project

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,839
all the way to very senior um techs and

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,640
uh people with banking chops and banking

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,800
system

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,560
experience and then people just learning

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,399
what that's about

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,120
and that makes it a very vibrant

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,120
conversation

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,839
we've recently made a major uh release

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,360
center act 1.4 so i know each of these

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
topics i'm touching on

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
are actually going to be full sessions

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,399
later on in the panel

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,680
um later on in the in the agenda in the

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,160
schedule but

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,360
um you know michael could you just say

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,959
something about

00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,040
um what's the uh uh

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,120
what's behind this recent jump in

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,240
contributions and how is that

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,519
um how does that look today

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,079
to you right so i that that's that's a

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,920
very good

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,079
point uh james thanks for for raising

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,640
that we've we've clearly seen a marked

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,600
uptake

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,160
um over the last 12-ish months or so our

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,519
community

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,600
has really kind of reinvigorated itself

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,720
um it was it was always active i would

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,959
say um and

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
i have a talk in two hours i think or

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,720
three or whatever

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,600
uh on reinvigorating uh finract

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
community

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
where i've attempted to look at some of

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,320
the factors that have contributed to

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
that

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
but in short my impression is that we

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,279
really managed to

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
uh you know open the doors and and make

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,720
it a welcoming place where

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,480
people can together achieve more

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,800
i think we've really sort of reignited

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,440
this community factor

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,720
catalyzed the community one of the

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,079
things we're going to touch upon in my

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,279
presentation is that

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,399
we probably underestimate sometimes uh

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,120
that it's not

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,800
as obvious as some of us think um how to

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
get started in open source how to get

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
started in apache

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,200
um that is something we need to be very

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,240
careful about to keep explaining keep

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,360
patiently

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,279
showing leading and i think we've

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,640
managed to do that

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,800
there's probably also an effect of one

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
thing having led to another more

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
contributors

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,880
breed more contributors right i think

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
that has happened to us over the last 12

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
months

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,920
we've had a number of um great people

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,079
join us in our efforts

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,079
um which creates this energy and just

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
dynamism in the community is like well

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,560
if

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
i'm also going to do that if he does and

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,720
wow something's happening in this

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,279
community

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
that's that's been the place that's been

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,079
infinite

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,640
yeah very very positive um so there's a

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,800
um

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,639
there's an interesting relationship with

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,040
the mephos initiative so

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,079
as i think javier mentioned the mephos

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,279
initiative

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,720
contributed the code to apache which

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,480
became fenurec

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,680
and so there one of the things that um

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,560
is part of that

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:13,519
is that mephos um still retains a set of

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,720
user interfaces community app android

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,079
app that sits on top

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
of of this so ed i'd like i'd like you

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,720
to

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,120
sort of say something about what that

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,440
relationship looks like to you

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,519
um because you wear both the finrak hat

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,160
you're on the pmc and you're also

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
um you know the president of mifos so

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,760
how do you

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
how do you see that relationship and how

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,320
do you

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,639
um explain that to people because i

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,399
think um this is one of the sources of

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,399
confusion sometimes in the community

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,079
yeah and i'll tie this back to michael's

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,800
you know reply about the

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
recent reinvigoration as well but really

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,760
you know we see

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,519
the technical governance and the

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,600
contributions from individuals

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,079
towards the core open source project

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,519
happening within the confines of apache

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,560
finrac and the apache software

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
foundation

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,399
and our project management committee and

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,560
then mifos you know one of our primary

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
aims is to bring together organizations

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,920
and companies to

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,760
have a common table to convene around

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,399
the road map discuss the future of the

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,000
product

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,600
which is something that apache

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,639
infrastructure you know isn't as

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,959
conducive for

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,800
in terms of organizations themselves and

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,760
then at an individual level we also want

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,680
to provide

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
that gateway and onboarding experience

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,480
for developers you know new commercial

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
companies

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,480
new volunteers who you know need a bit

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,959
more handholding they need a bit more

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,720
education on the mission overall and

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,200
then lastly you know we want to provide

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,279
some

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,199
you know air coverage just about like

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,040
how finrac can be used the different use

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,480
cases that can be provided

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,160
and then you know at the end of the day

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,040
since we are working with all of these

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,120
organizations

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,800
and bringing together companies you know

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,360
coalescing around the road map

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,360
we aim to really be that marketplace and

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,519
secretariat hub in the middle to

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,199
connect use cases with solutions you

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
know help individuals from the finrac

00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,680
community

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
identify how they can contribute to

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,040
these solutions how

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,360
individuals can find solutions that they

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,360
can deploy and in order to do that you

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,600
know at mephos we also maintain

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,040
a suite of user interfaces and reference

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
solutions that help to

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,600
demonstrate the capabilities of what's

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:19,040
possible with the finrac apis

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,680
terrific um if you're just joining us um

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,199
please go ahead and put questions into

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,519
the chat and we will be

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,720
um getting to them a little in a little

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,800
bit here

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,880

generally speaking what

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,680
challenges or opportunities do you see

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,839
with the code and the community

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,839
and i'm first going to go to um javier

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,199

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,680
there's always stress results questions

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,240
and and and more on that there is always

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,720
uh

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,920
people that is interested in interested

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,120
in using finrac

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,399
and using miphos as their core banking

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,519
application

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,440
we are seeing more and more uh

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,560
fintechs and financial institutions

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,480
coming to

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
to and asking for for this

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,120
implementation

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,839
the the the the big challenge is

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,880
how we sustain and maintain the

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,000
community

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,199
and and how we move from uh

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,880
past with heavy uh

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,440
sponsors that were basically supporting

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,199
the entire work of the community

00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,279
through our distributed work

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,399
and we need to grow we need to

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,880
get more companies and and

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
and individuals that are contributing

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,600
back in different ways

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,320
either economically financially or with

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,279
code

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
so we as a community can can move

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,759
forward and

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,120
leave behind the the

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,040
the the contributors the the big

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,759
contributors that we had in the past

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,199
that were

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,600
kind of solo supporting the community

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,440
and and i think that that is the biggest

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,480
challenge yeah ed over to you

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,759
next yeah and just to build on what

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
javier said and going back to what

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,839
michael said

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,759
you know one of our biggest you know

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,320
opportunities but it's also a challenge

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
is

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
you know taking that reinvigorated

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
community and contribution model that

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
michael has gotten jump started in

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,040
really having the commercial players and

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,759
the members of our ecosystem who are

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,680
actually

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
you know building solutions used on a

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,120
daily basis on top of interact

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
getting them to you know be able to

00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,279
contribute back to the upstream

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,800
development

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,959
so that's been a message you know we've

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,559
been trying to impart over the past year

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,959
is really encouraging this upstream

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,360
development enabling a virtuous cycle

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,959
where

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,959
everybody benefits from the innovation

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,880
you've been building and then

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,880
you know in turn everybody can lower the

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,959
overall cost of maintaining

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,880
you know building and developing new

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,480
innovation on top of the software

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
so i think that's one of the you know

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
key challenges just to the growth of the

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,799
community

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
but also as javier noted the ongoing

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,799
sustainability

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,160
of the community itself and then i do

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,400
think you know we've got a really good

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,240
opportunity in front of us to just make

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,880
you know finer act more well-known you

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,960
know this is a the fintech space is very

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
you know hot and dynamic right now and

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,000
just we're doing you know

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
better than a lot of like the commercial

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,160
players out there so we need to make

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,080
known

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,480
that there is this viable open source

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
platform which is accessible to all

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
built on the you know most modern

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
technologies and demonstrate what use

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
cases it can be

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
you know used for so people are aware of

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
this great asset and this great

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,919
community

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,440
that they can work around um so michael

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,360
i want to come to you but i kind of want

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,600
to change this the question a little bit

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,240
from opportunities and challenges to um

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,000
maybe something around you know the

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
contribution model

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,240
and maybe have you sort of focus in on

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,840
that part of the opportunities and

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,200
and challenges yeah so i i think there's

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,280
there's two parts to this and i think

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,760
we've uh spoken about the first part

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,799
uh a lot edward you were saying javier

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,720
so i'm not going to dwell

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,160
more into that the the first part being

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,760
just um

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
get people want to contribute right

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,400
understand that together we can do more

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,480
and not

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,559
basically maintain forks we know that a

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,320
number of integrators are maintaining

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,240
forks of finrac um and so there's

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
more general open source advocacy work

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,039
to be done there is like well it makes

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,640
more sense for you to come and work

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,080
upstream um i think at a more

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,559
you want to call a technical level or a

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,880
more practical level or something i

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,840
i think over the years have genuinely

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,679
learned that

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,559
um it is not as obvious to many people

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,000
who

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,760
want to contribute to really figure out

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,760
how to engage in a community like this i

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
think there's a number of people who are

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,600
not trying to hold back any code they're

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,120
not trying to um

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,799
you know they don't have concerns about

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,080
something being proprietary and

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,480
and something wanting to uh not share

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,679
but they're generally at a loss about

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
how to engage in an open source

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,320
community

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,840
if you've not done this elsewhere before

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,840
if you if you don't um

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,360
sort of know the the trade if i call it

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
like that um

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,640
it's not that obvious right it's like i

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
did something

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,400
and so like you guys want this here it

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
is

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
it's like no no we don't want to go

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,080
looking for what you did we want you to

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,640
come

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,840
and and work in the community to propose

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,799
it um

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,799
and here is here's something from me i

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
throw it over well this doesn't build

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,559
but you guys are not going to fix this

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,120
for me no that's not how it works

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,799
i think there are a lot of things that

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,640
on the practical level there

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,159
we take for granted we kind of like oh

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
yeah open source yeah easy

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,600
but it's actually not that obvious how

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,159
to do that right and i think

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,840
the best thing we can do there is is is

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,679
be helpful be open

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,559
be uh patient i think that's as a

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,200
community something that's very

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,559
important

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,520
as we grow for our future i think we

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,720
it's partially in our hands how how much

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,880
we

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,919
are uh welcoming and help people who

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,080
want to contribute to

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,919
the second group to actually make that

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,240
happen

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
yeah yeah and one thing at the mephos oh

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,880
sorry james it's gonna say the me first

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,440
initiative you know we're working better

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,679
on

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,880
just communications and visibility so

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,320
making aware

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
all the powerful use cases that are

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,200
being supported by finrac you know

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,880
recognizing the

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,640
contributors that michael's been helping

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
to onboard and then also

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
yes being more visible about what's

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,000
coming in the future so we're trying to

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
pull

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,159
together a more cohesive roadmap to

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,520
showcase you know what's coming

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,360
and what people can expect because i

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,120
think there's you know still

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,880
some of that lack of visibility that

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,400
hinders people being aware of how they

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,360
could use finract and where they can

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,520
contribute

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,559
i think james if i can jump in with an

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,200
additional thought or something

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,880
something

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
that's a little different in the finra

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,760
community from from other open source

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,640
projects

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,720
is due to the variety of of our um

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,840
different stakeholders and contributors

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,400
we get a lot of um

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,600
i would say less technical less open

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,640
source experience people than you would

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,159
see in other communities

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,159
a lot of the more technical projects

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
but by the time you want to contribute

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,559
to kubernetes or to um

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
tomcat apache or something like that

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,919
you're you're

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,520
sort of well into the code um i think

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,960
infiner act is it's a very interesting

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
community because we get people who are

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,679
users

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,840
who want to contribute this small bug

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,799
fix this thing that didn't work for them

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,679
that they want to

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,280
share they would like to share um and

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,400
it's not so obvious how

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,799
so that's a little different for us

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,159
yeah um let's talk a little bit more

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,159
about how this

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,480
this stack of technology is in some

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,520
sense closer to

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,080
um the end user um

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,280
does that does that make it more

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,960
challenging michael and i think you were

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,640
touching on this so i want you to

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,000
maybe expand a little bit on what you

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
were saying there yeah

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,880
i think i think so i think this is in in

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,720
the sort of

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,600
list or ranking of open source projects

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,720
this stands out a little bit as a more

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,720
functional oriented closer to end users

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
project than many of the technical

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,520
projects that you typically find out

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,080
there if you think open source what do

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,000
you think

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,760
what was the like tell me three open

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,559
source projects that come to mind

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,520
ssl that's all right right like

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,400
technical

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,440
linux kernel yeah your web servers they

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,080
won't be

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,840
thinner application like there aren't

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,159
that many successful

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
um open source applications in the sort

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,480
of

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,760
um enterprise software space well

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,039
crms core banking they're more

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,559
more unique beasts and we're one of them

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,360
right right um so i i know there's a

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,440
couple of uh

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,480
questions that are coming on there so i

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,799
want to get to them

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,039
um again put your question in the chat

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,159
and we'll we'll try to get to it um

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,000
how do we um uh well

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,200
i want to talk a little bit about you

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
know the

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
um

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,679
the topic of wallets mobile money

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,280
wallets

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,640
and extension extensibility into ai and

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,000
machine learning and

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
there are sessions that are going to be

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,720
covering these things but um

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,080
can we go first to uh javier just

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,679
comment a little bit about

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
you know sort of where this might be

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,640
going in terms of uh

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,279
you know adjacencies or sort of new

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,159
use case um new use cases that are

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:51,600
implemented on finrac

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,720
absolutely so um

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,559
what what i think that it's going to

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,840
uh leverage and and and

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,360
project the next wave of financial

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,480
inclusion it's it's

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,960
it's on sits on top of of mobile uh and

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
all of

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
all the mobile revolution that is

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
already

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,080
here is going to happen when i started

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,720
to talk about this mobile

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,960
mobile finance thing it was like this is

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,039
going to happen this is going to happen

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,480
and and now it's here everybody has a a

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,400
a smartphone and and

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,520
most people in the planet have access to

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,320
internet so

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,039
being able to use their cell phone as a

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,640
branch

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,559
or as a banking experience it's

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,600
something that it's already happening

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,240
and and and one of the things that that

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,880
i learned

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,000
from this community remember when when

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,840
we were in in

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,799
one of the methods uh

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,200
presidential events of paul married

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,039
saying

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,320
to us that the power of the open sources

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,360
sits on the standardization that the

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,480
the the thing that that that open source

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,720
is is how software industries

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,600
uh how the software industry creates

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,320
standards

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,640
and that resonated on me a lot because

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,120
it makes sense because the financial

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,000
industry one thing that lacks its

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,880
standards

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,799
and if you see every everywhere you see

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,559
there's no standard

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,320
every currency every country has a

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,520
currency that's a different standard

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,880
every

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,440
iso e3 implementation that you want to

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,720
think

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
it's different every transfer system

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
from one bank to another

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,400
every bank has a different core banking

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,440
every financial institution so

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,640
having a side project like finra

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,360
that as a factor standard

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,039
for for the financial inclusion for the

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,120
billions of people that

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,320
are going to to be in the in the

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,480
financial industry in the next 10 years

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,679
it's going to it's going to generate a

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,960
lot of of

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
of economics of scale and it's going to

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,559
be a great thing

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,159
and and that's why i think that that the

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,480
the companies that are using

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,440
finner act to support their mobile

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,880
wallets

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,120
are are joining this standardization and

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,559
and this is a thing that is going to be

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,919
uh relevant

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,440
for the future great um

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,120
that was a that was a great and very

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,960
complete answer what i want to do is

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,520
quickly go through a couple of questions

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,240
this is going to be rapid fire polling

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,200
um

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,919
we're going to give this a try i you

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
these

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,360
these people do not know what my

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,000
questions are going to be so um there's

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,120
no gaming

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:44,480
going on here um and

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,720
you're either gonna do yes no or

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
in between okay i'll give you i'll give

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,640
you the in between all right

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,679
so uh we're gonna start off with some

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,960
easy ones so

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:58,240
is finrak 1.4 a major

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,240
improvement to the code base

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,520
yes no but use the thumb use the thumb

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,120
ed okay

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,840
um do we need more contributions from

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,840
the community

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,320
yeah um is the documentation on the

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,320
project adequate

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,360
ah sorry okay

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,279
good um is it important to have a

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,399
finrak 1.5 1.5 release by the end of

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,200
this year

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,200
is it important

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,840
okay it shows momentum maybe um is it

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,279
important to have a finrax cn

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,279
full release by the end of the year

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,039
ah okay we'll talk about that more um

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,000
should finrec one point x implement

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,840
something

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
like a containerized uh microservices

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,080
strategy

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,720
interact 1.x should it begin to

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,159
implement something like that

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:09,360
ed maybe okay um ed's positive on that

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,760
um is finrak uh

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
cloud

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,760
okay review in the cloud right now

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,120
all right um do we need a separate users

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,960
list

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,640
from the dev list separate from the dev

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,159
list

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,360
we used to have one so do we need a

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,360
separate user's list again

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
we need a separate user list yes no in

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,840
between okay got it

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,200
um in between does okay so back to some

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,440
easy questions maybe

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,200
um does financial inclusion keep you

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,399
interested and motivated in this project

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,399
sure yeah and um

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,240
do you think that finra could be used as

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,279
a core banking solution

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,799
for a disruptor or a neo bank um

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:08,559
in a regulated market yeah

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,320
awesome okay um so

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,840
we've got some questions and commentary

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,840
going on in the polling um

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,840
mean uh in the world

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,399
yeah you do look like you did the same

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,440
daily look like john malkovich

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,840
okay this is time

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,880
i've heard this particularly when i give

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,720
this look

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,559
um okay so um

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,640
let's talk a little bit about the

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,600
questions that we've gotten so

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,559
there's a lot of fintech applications

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,559
out there and some

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:48,320
sometimes people ask so is finrak

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,520
just like app x is it is it like that

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,919
app that i've

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,000
built or is it like the you know this

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,159
financial tool that i've built

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,399
can you say maybe something about what

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,760
the domain of finrac

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:03,440
is um to try to help clarify um

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,760
michael i'd like you to sort of jump in

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,080
on this if you would

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,600
sure yeah so i think this question i'm

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,279
hoping i'm understanding it right i

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,279
think this question is asking about

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
um the functional domain right what

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,760
interact covers

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
yeah so finrac is a core banking

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,039
solution

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,799
um the the domain entities if you wish

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,080
if you have a technical background are

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:30,240
accounts clients loans

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,240
um savings accounts as such

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,760
it's more general than this other thing

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,600
that somebody listed here which seems to

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,240
be

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,000
more narrowly scoped billing solution

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,120
finrax really is some

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,080
software package that you can run

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,080
a bank with

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,799
is that right answer the question

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,559
specifically yep

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,720
yeah no there's and there's quite a lot

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,360
written on this um

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,880
and uh we do probably need to bring some

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,440
of that ideas over

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,200
some of those documentations over to

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,240
finrac from mephos from some of the

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,399
original

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
explanation because i think maybe some

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,799
of that is lost

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,320
in the in the documentation um

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:18,159
and in terms of how how people would get

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,640
onboarded into fenrak what's the

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,559
what's the right way for a new developer

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,559
to come on to the or what's a good way

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,000
for the new developer to come on to the

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,480
come on to the project um and

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
i i keep going back to michael i know

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,120
you have a lot of opinions on this so

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,080
please tell us what you what you have

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,840
for a guide

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,240
so i think we do have we do have two

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,600
categories of users we see this on the

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
lists right from the

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,240
kinds of questions we get i think there

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,880
are those who um

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,360
use the release software i think there

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,320
are a lot of people out there who

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,960
have been waiting for us to release 1.4

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
who

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,760
download the zip and and start it up and

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,320
run it on their server

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,760
somewhere and then there are those who

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,880
made the step

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,720
to clone the source code build it

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,679
themselves

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,440
and try to probably first locally make

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,159
some changes themselves probably not yet

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,399
pushing them

00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,919
anywhere but like oh this doesn't work

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,279
the way i want this validation is wrong

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,399
i got to fix this

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,720
um and and i think our

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,600
our mission if if uh if i can say it

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,200
like that

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,679
is to uh do the best we can

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,200
to convert the first group uh to the

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,799
second group or some of the users of the

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,760
first group to the second group

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,519
i think as an open source project one of

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,720
the value propositions that we bring

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,880
is that well it's open source so that um

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,320
you don't write to the list uh saying

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,919
this is broken although that's helpful

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,919
of course it's helpful we value end user

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,240
feedback of course that's that's useful

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,519
but this is broken and i fixed it and

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,799
here's a fix

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,159
is really where i think the the value of

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,840
having an open source core banking

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,320
solution is

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,880
okay thank you i think i like that

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,640
answer

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,640
um uh can we can we also talk a little

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,000
bit about what this community looks like

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,360
in um well i'm going to

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,640
pause on that that's going to be my next

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,559
question i'm going to go to a question

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,600
that i saw here on the list here

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,240
um where there's

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,679
uh you know there's code debt um

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,279
ed do you see um

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,840
you know the number of tickets um

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,559
that are on jira as an indication of

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,159
code debt

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,679
or as an indication of community um

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:46,000
engagement and uh right

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:47,760
go ahead and try to tangle with that one

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,279
yes so i think it's both because we

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,799
encourage people when they have

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,720
you know a new feature that they'd like

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,320
to see to create a ticket on jira

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,000
so that you know wouldn't be a measure

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,039
of code debt that's actually you know

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,200
interest in

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,159
demand and wanting to see new innovation

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
get built

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,080
and then i think you know the more small

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,960
bugs and issues get identified that's

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,240
also a

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,159
measure of the health of the community

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,599
and the engagement but i do think you

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
know there are a number of tickets in

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,560
the backlog that michael

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,399
has been able to resurrect and begin to

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,520
address that do you know measure the

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,440
technical debt

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,119
that is there in the community so i

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,119
think yeah the size of the

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,879
the number of issues you know isn't a

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,359
direct measure of the technical debt but

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,520
i think

00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,960
we are doing a good job of trying to you

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,520
know catalog what's in the backlog

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,800
identify what is actually technical debt

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,119
what's new innovation that could be

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,879
worked on and then this last release you

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,599
know to speak to what celio's question

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,960
was there

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,800
we did address the number of those

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,399
pieces through volunteers

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,919
interns and we know you know there are a

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,399
number of outstanding pieces that we'd

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,480
encourage

00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,159
anybody in the community especially you

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
know those partners or individuals who

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,720
might have already

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,240
addressed this technical debt on their

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,679
local forks to you know

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,119
jump on the mailing list discuss what

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,480
you've already built and begin

00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,240
contributing back because

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,920
you know as michael has noted he's very

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,680
welcoming they're encouraging and

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,800
don't be scared to yeah raise your hand

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,760
and show that you've got something to

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,320
share so

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,520
and i think it is it is probably

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,200
appropriate to throw in here that the

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,880
1.4 release

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,440
is a major step forward in technical

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,839
debt reduction i think sometimes we are

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,560
we're maybe forgetting how much we we uh

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,920
we achieved right so let's give that a

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,599
shout out to all the contributors we've

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,640
had some great google summer of code

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,920
contributors

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,760
some people who've joined us as a

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,560
aside from their day jobs spending

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,359
weekends i mean we've moved from

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,359
java 8 to java 11. we've upgraded all of

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,320
our third-party dependencies

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,359
um we have fixed a couple of security

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
issues

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,800
um the 1.4 release was a big step

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,280
forward

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,720
a big jump in technical debt reduction

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,839
um

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,599
yep yep yeah i think also

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,599
yeah the proactive measures too michael

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,119
that month has implemented so

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,640
you know we're going to improve the code

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,240
quality and the cleanliness of the code

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,480
on the future basis so

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,240
you know we can not have like all of

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,440
this unclean code going forward in the

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
future so that'll be

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,560
a big proactive improvement i think it's

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,680
great that you mentioned that yeah that

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,280
you um remind

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,880
that to everyone so we have now

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,680
automated call quality checks which will

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
help us

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,359
um likely for years going forward maybe

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,800
yeah um there's a question on the list

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,160
on the chat over there

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,480
about um testing and um

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,680
what's our what's our current coverage

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,240
on um

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,040
code that's tested you know the

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,160
automated testing the integrated testing

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,400
um cicl

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
what what do you and then michael you

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,880
set up something that

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,400
that i thought was really terrific um

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,520
on the google infrastructure can you

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,760
talk a little bit about that i'm going

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,320
to go to you first on that

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,920
right so um we actually one of the

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,520
google summer of code contributions from

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,040
from month and one of our students who

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,000
did a great job was actually test

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,920
coverage

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
um so there is a command now that we can

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,280
run to see test coverage i don't have

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,480
the number in my mind so i can't tell

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,240
you what the number is in terms of

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,520
integration test coverage

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,839
but the infrastructure is there to

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,960
measure that um the what you're

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,440
referring to james is the um

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,400
always up uh runtime environment

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,960
something that

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,760
um helps us i think to demonstrate our

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
platform

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,320
and let people try it out and and find

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,320
some um

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,480
gaps and problems in it so we have at on

00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,200
finrac.dev

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,320
we have a server that runs the code

00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,240
permanently

00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,720
um there's a talk about that as well and

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,640
then later i think it's on wednesday

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,000
we explain more how we set that up that

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,280
is one way i think i think there's

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,599
there's others but i think there's one

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,480
way

00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,040
how to make the system easily accessible

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,160
and let

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,640
users you know try it out find uh

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,800
problems really do quality control on in

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,880
a always up centralized place

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,640
i think that was an important step for

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,720
our community to have

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,920
the latest and greatest code always

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,920
always up there and running

00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,440
i would say more generally in terms of

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,359
quality

00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,280
we obviously rely on the community this

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,040
is a community project right if somebody

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,599
thinks that there is

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,520
minions somewhere who do qa

00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,119
magically at the apache foundation

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,760
that's not how it works right there are

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,680
no

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,280
apache software foundation staff who

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,040
test finra act or anything like that

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
that's not how resource or project this

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,720
works the code is

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,560
um as stable and as at the quality as we

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,400
as a community make it to be right

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,079
if you're listening to this and you know

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,520
of a problem um

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,280
if you have the skill sets to fix it

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,960
yourselves contribute if you

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,320
um know about the problem but don't have

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
the skill set to fix it raise a bug

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,960
about it on

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,000
jira ask on the mailing list if somebody

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,440
wants to engage

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,040
and work with you to get it fixed we

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,680
have examples of where this works right

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,480
um

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,760
a few days ago somebody posted a

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,119
functional feature not working you

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,160
couldn't attach notes to savings

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,800
accounts

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,440
and this was pretty amazing i wanna i

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
wanna

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,280
give a shout out to that right that was

00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,400
posted like last friday or monday or

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,079
something and

00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,520
one of our star contributors jumped at

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,119
it and there's like oh yeah

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,480
this sounds fun what is what is going on

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,280
here let me test this i can see it's

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,000
broken

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,599
give me a day pull request we reviewed

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,839
it merged it and this block is fixed

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,440
that was pretty cool right you don't get

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,960
that in yeah

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
you don't get some of your commercial

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,359
vendors at that speed

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,200
yeah but it realizes it relies on people

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,680
raising issues on the list and they rely

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,640
on

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,720
um people contributing fixes on on the

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,800
upstream project

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,240
yep yep and that's and that's the

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,200
virtuous cycle that we were talking

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,000
about earlier and that you were

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,800
highlighting is

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,480
uh is how you get more fixes because

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,119
somebody does a contribution and people

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,520
say oh

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,400
it's an active project people are making

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,040
it better

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,720
i'm gonna also get involved you know

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,760
it's it's a lonely thing if you're

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,920
trying to build

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,200
something by yourself it's a fun thing

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,200
when you've actually got this

00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,040
community of people trying to to bring

00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,720
things in um

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,400
so i don't know how much time we have i

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,880
think we're really close on

00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,599
on time here so we have one minute one

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,720
minute

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,640
really quick in a few words

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,560
how are what is this going to look like

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,560
in um in three years

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,520
uh javier really quick

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,359
so i think that we are going to see a

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,480
bigger community and

00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,839
and and we are going to see okay that's

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,839
good that's more than three words ed

00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
go

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,599
