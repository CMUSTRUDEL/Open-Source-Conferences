Latin America has become a world benchmark where social mobility is hampered by public policies, access to information and therefore to financial services. The use of Open Source, Fineract in this particular case, allows to be the base of the ecosystem that is changing the difficulties in opportunities for Public and Private Institutions that have a perspective of social and financial inclusion. In the proposal we expose the challenges we face in sharing knowledge to the Fineract and Open Source community.
