Description: 
	How to implement a digital bank with a social approach using open source
Raúl Sibaja, Karina Ortiz

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Latin America has become a world benchmark where social mobility is hampered by public policies, access to information and therefore to financial services. The use of Open Source, Fineract in this particular case, allows to be the base of the ecosystem that is changing the difficulties in opportunities for Public and Private Institutions that have a perspective of social and financial inclusion. In the proposal we expose the challenges we face in sharing knowledge to the Fineract and Open Source community.

studied i applied mathematics and

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,280
computing

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640

raul civaca and i also studied

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,360
applied mathematics and computing i have

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000

applications

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,159
we have gone to several hackathons in

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,200
which

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,159
we have present

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
proposals such as implementing but

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
implementing

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,840
banking in a virtual and sorry in a

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,119
virtual assistant

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,080
so that way people can check

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,520
their balance accounts or make movements

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,720
in their accounts

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,159
and we join we just a

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,280
voice comment or instruction and several

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
banks

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,479
have taken and

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,840
take it as reference to implement it in

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,840
their mobile applications

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
so we want to talk about the financial

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
inclusion

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,640
problems that we face in mexico and also

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,200
about the challenges that exist

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,040
and the short-term solutions that we

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
have proposed

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,280
as well as what we have implemented

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,079
according to the new regulations

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
of agreements that the mexican

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,040
government has

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,000
well currently there is a big problem

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,160
with financial

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
inclusion in mexico 78 percent of

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,360
mexican adults

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,640
are excluded from the financial sector

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
because and they don't have a bank

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
account

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,640
or any

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,160
any inclusion

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,680
with a banks there are

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,040
more than 2 000 of many ships

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,040
that exist in the country and

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,319
42 percent of those

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,840
have access to financial services 25

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,319
percent don't have access to financial

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,280
services

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,760
16 percent only have two access channels

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,680
to

00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,959
those services uh 11 only have

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,159
a correspondence three percent only have

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,760
atms and two percent only have bank

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,159
branches

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,319
the use of cash in the country is too

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,440
high according to the bank of mexico

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,879
night of the 10 mexicans use bills and

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,000
coins

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,080
to cover their daily expenses

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,120
part of this is caused b by informality

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,239
and fear of oversight

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,599
but in any case today in the country the

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,120
use of money

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,159
is the main competition of digital media

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,200
although it is more insecure and

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,360
inefficient on the other hand

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,640
there is mistrust in financial

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
institutions

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,519
it is common for people to choose the

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,360
mattress over the saving accounts

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,560
that's real in in our country insecurity

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,360
this deception and poor customer service

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,840
are

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
valued sadly associated with banks in

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,280
the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,080
national territory well in

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,720
[Music]

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
some parts of the world and mostly here

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
in

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,239
mexico and latin america discrimination

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
is a branch where whether based on skin

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,359
color

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,400
how would you dress or social economic

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,759
status

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,440
are some of the factors and why people

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,800
don't go to the banks

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,000
in 2018 in

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,759
the there was a a study

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,400
where there the where

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,720
this study measured discrimination by a

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,560
skin color in bank branches

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,880
for the experiment she collected

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,479
three with fair skin and three with

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,320
brown skin

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,360
who made around 600

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,759
visits to branches in all the locations

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,880
of mexico city

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,639
open leaving each branch they answer a

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,080
questionary on perception of

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,360
discrimination

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,800
the results show a history of skin color

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,080
discrimination

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,080
in 25 of the visits the brown

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,280
actors perceived that the ex executive

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,680
was root against 11 percent in the case

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,479
of the

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,560
light-skinned actors the result of the

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,360
experiment showed that the brown skin

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
actors

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,199
fell less and threated and

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
were less frequently considered

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,039
potential clients by bank executive

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,240
executives in the mexico city

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:43,199
delegations well so now

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:47,520
we want to move about digital banking

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:51,440
is one of our solutions with um finrac

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,000
so well let's talk about digital banking

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,120
the services offered by banking mexico

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
and in the world

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,800
have changed notably in recent years

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,680
going from a traditional form of branch

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
services

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,160
to telephone banking then to electronic

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,080
banking and now to financial services on

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,360
mobile devices and

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,199
identification biometrics among other

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,720
advances there are two types of digital

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,160
banking in mexico

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,720
those that are emerged as independent

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
entities from traditional banking and

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,080
that operate with an electrical

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
and electronic monique money listens and

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
those that are

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,639
associated with traditional banks that

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
therefore

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,560
have the banking of large entity in both

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,600
cases

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,400
because you have a license the money is

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,560
safe

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,880
in addition to mexico there is the law

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
to regulate financial technology

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
institution

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,560
um there is no and no lie as

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,919
fintech we have our law

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,000
and this law protect financial

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,880
institutions

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,639
about digital banking

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
we work in a company the company is in

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
the

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,039
fintech sector so

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,400
we are going to talk about that in just

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
a moment

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,880
well um some digital banks require

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,599
a require you to do all your banking

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,720
through your

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,360
smartphone this may lead to you and not

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
being

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,319
able to use internet banking from your

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,199
computer or tablet

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,520
currently the banks that we knew have

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
been

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
updating and developing digital tools in

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,199
mexico

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,479
and 182 digital tools and

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,360
we identified and there are

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,160
mainly four banks that have developed

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
more than

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:01,280
40 percent of these existing tools

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,960
and this means that while some banks

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:09,599
have been concerned with offering

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,800
digital experience built on cutting-edge

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,919
technology offering personalized

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,960
services easy to use and

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,240
with an excellent user experience the

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,610
digital development

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,319
of other entities show

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,360
[Music]

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,400
that growth in digital channels

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
may not be a priority compared to other

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,479
activities of

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
this business

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,279
the digital banking in mexico in 2020

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,599
report highlights that are

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,640
the main segment in which institutions

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
have developed the

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,000
digital tools um that is mobile banking

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:56,000
with 82 of the total

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
then there was banking with 44 payments

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
with

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,000
36 percent and savings and

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,000
investment with 33

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,279
so now we are going to move to fintech

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,320
yes we we are going to talk about the

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,600
fintech sector

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,399
and we where we

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
are working right now and according to

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,920
the

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
inter american development bank the

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,120
number of

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,600
fintech companies in latin america grew

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,399
about 66 in recent years

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
whether they are banking initiatives

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,560
that are

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,760
originally found

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,279
100 percent

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,560
or traditional companies that have taken

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,000
parts of this model

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,480
and fintech model and

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,760
they implemented in his organization

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,640
the fintech entities that

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:06,160
are by his own are known as new banks

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,920
fintech banks or challenger banks

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,120
and those has increased

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,839
in the last years and have benefits

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,160
with each the inner digital banking

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,760
proposal

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,040
in mexico there have been few startups

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
success stories while we can boast of

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,519
being the

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
country on the continent with the

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,320
largest number of

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,760
fintechs most still do not have scale

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,480
and are very early stage

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,440
of raising capital um they think the

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
world

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,600
requires comprehensive solutions that

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,079
allow institutions to have

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
absolute control of their operations

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,200
through

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:54,880
automation that allows compliance

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,560
more efficient process accounting

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,480
up-to-date improved competitiveness

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,480
and better custom services

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:10,000
well we are going to talk about

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,279
some digital banking challenges that

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,320
presented here in latin america

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,600
we define six key points as challenge

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,720
and challenges that digital banking has

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,040
today

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,000
and the first one is the generation

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,880
gap banks most of our services to

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
customers

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,959
who are not digital natives at the same

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,680
time as

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,680
those who who are digital

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,720
customers without a with

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,600
digital native tools

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,200
and the financial technology or fintech

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,399
institution

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,839
are a one of the other

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,399
challenges that are presenting right now

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
because the banks have the option of

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,279
allowing

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:07,279
with these types of companies or be the

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:10,480
a competition of those the evolution

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,399
of the business models are the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
this is the third point of the

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,200
challenges because the

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,760
the utilization has generated

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
the possibility of developing new

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,240
business models

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,360
that do not require physical spaces such

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
as

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,839
branches

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,959
and the other three

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:40,320
three points of these challenges as the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,600
is the financial inclusion although

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,320
banks have great opportunity to reach uh

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
30 percent of the mexican population

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,440
that's

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,560
the uh that not have a

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,360
final financial product if they do not

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
adapt

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,920
their model they will not be able to

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
surpass fintech companies in this

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,880
mission

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,560
the organized structure

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:12,160
that are the banks that

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,839
are large institutions with long and

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:19,279
uh internal process so they they just

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,200
need to modify them and be more

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,120
efficient

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:29,040
next and there are some secure security

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:31,360
um problems because the digitalization

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,240
of bankies possess

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,240
security challenges like

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,360
there are some attractives to cyber

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,959
criminals

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,639
and well today there are

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,519
about 7.4 million

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
banking users in mexico but only 1

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,360
million

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,440
of them are in rural

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,680
areas and there are there are

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,880
having a great challenge to the banks

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,600
okay now let's move to talk about the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,880
copy and the problems we have to face

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,720
with this

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,519
um so

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
since we have been isolated

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,839
there is a study about this and about

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,360
the

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,639
visits in the banks and

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,519
bank branches in mexico can register up

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,000
30 percent fewer visits as a result of

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,160
the

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,079
chronovirus banks can potentially say

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,440
the adoption of mobile energy

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,079
for banking as well as provide their

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,199
flexibility that their clients need to

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,760
overcome the crisis

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,079
since the adoption of digital channels

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,199
and online banking has grown

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,399
as a result of social distancing

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,839
measures revealed the study that

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,800
the visits in the banks has been fewer

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,079
than

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,800
other time the trend towards the

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,279
digitalization of banking

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,320
have been accelerated by social

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,839
isolation

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,959
measures during the covet pandemic

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,839
however there is still resistance

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,959
or difficulties in using online banking

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,839
services

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,480
by some customers so banking institution

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,639
must use

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,839
different means to educate customers

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,440
about their

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,839
benefits and practice practicality

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
of their digital services

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,959
we have some regulations in mexico as in

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,079
every country and financial services in

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,360
mexico are

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,920
highly regulated there are

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,959
clear reasons for this it is important

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,839
to take

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,720
care of the health of financial system

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,600
and

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,440
maintain people's trust in it protect

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,040
people's savings and prevent

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,680
crimes such as money laundering however

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,120
this regulation results in a high cost

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,399
of compliance

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,199
and in order to justify this cost

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,839
it is necessary to have a large scale

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,639
something difficult for a

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,680
startup well

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,199
what mexico is currently looking for

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,480
financial inclusion with a social focus

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,720
the economy ministry

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,920
launches a new financial product in the

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,519
last days

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,800
uh is known as a productive

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,680
uh direct credit this is a

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
focused on a small formal business that

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,480
seeks of of

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,079
strength and these economic units in the

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,680
face of the curing hair

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:02,800
health and contingency caused by the

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:07,120
coronavirus the economy ministry

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,160
launches a new modality of micro credits

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:13,679
focused on formal small business

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,959
that seeks of strength and

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,720
well this is a a program that is placed

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,360
to

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:28,000
support 10 000 in financing

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:32,799
areas that are

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,720
most affected by the situation

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:39,520
so why we decided to use open source

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,080
um as we know currently there are a lot

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,240
of

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,200
there are large number of banks in latin

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,799
america

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,160
and in the world that use open source to

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,360
carry out their most important

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,160
operations

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,039
this type of open platform helps to

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,320
modernize

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,360
i.t systems making it a priority to

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,360
for latin america companies to adapt to

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,760
business models and digital services

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,760
and become part of the phenomenon of

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,240
digital transformation

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,120
in this environment of permanent in

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,320
innovation

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,520
and change open source or open source

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,240
has managed to respond with reliable and

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,640
innovative solutions despite the fact

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,039
that

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,799
in the past open source companies had to

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,160
face obstacles because many

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,160
organizations

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
didn't fully understand this type of

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,400
software especially

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,160
they had dabs about how technology

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,799
developed in

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,360
completely open and free environment

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,679
could be

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
safe

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,480
and well uh we uh

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,919
for for the final we are going to

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,600
talk about uh why we

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,120
use uh myphos and finra for this

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,240
implementation

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,320
and well in order to meet the challenges

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,520
and needs that currently exist

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,640
in mexico with a huge

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,160
digital and financial gap it takes four

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
main factors

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,919
the first is an access penetration

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,880
of the financial system in terms of

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,080
infrastructure

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,360
available to offer in financial

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,559
services and products that is to the

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,039
points of contact

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
between financial institutions and the

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,080
population

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:34,640
and the second is the use the the

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,640
use of um the

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,080
one or more financial products or

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,760
service

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,440
services as well as the with which

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,039
they are used this refers to the demand

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,640
for financial services

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,679
which in turn reflects the behavior

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,120
and needs of the population third

00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,480
is the consumer protection

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:04,480
and defense it refers to the fact

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,159
and that financial products and services

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,799
new or existing are under a framework

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,919
that

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,960
guarantees at least the transparency of

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,720
information and fair threat

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,120
treatment and effective mechanism

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,840
for the attention of compliance and

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
advice

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,480
from clients again against

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,600
unfair and abusive practices

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,679
and and the last one is the financial

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,720
education actions so that the population

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,679
acquires aptitudes and abilities and

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,799
knowledge

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,840
to be to be able and to carry

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,360

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,240
planning of their personal finances

00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:01,200
and services well and for the correct

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,159
execution of these factors a bank that

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,000
complies

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,320
with the guideline is first needed

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
and the main tool of banking is the core

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,240
system

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,200
that is why in recent months we have

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,760
collaborated in implementing finrect

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,640
in the bank from which the government

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,919
wants to

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,360
offer social programs with a social

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,960
focus

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:31,200
so for this solution we are using finrad

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,320
one and finra fcn we use phenolic one

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,520
for all credit

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,159
development all the loans and such as

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,159
direct loans and that support

00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,760
americans who were several affected by

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,120
kobe

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,880
development allows the population to

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,120
apply for a loan and sink the contract

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,840
virtually so you don't have to go to the

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,280
offices

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,880

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,120
do the pandemic and the social distances

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
this is a good opportunity for people

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,080
who

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,080

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,480

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,000
regulations

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,159

electronic payment system

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,640

world benchmark

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,559
