Description: 
	Fineract: Reinvigorating Community
Michael Vorburger

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The Apache Fineract community has seen a marked uptake in new activity in PRs and on the dev mailing list. This talk will present some of the measures that we have taken which enabled this. It will use the Apache Fineract project as an example, but the shared lessons learnt will be generally applicable.

Michael is a long time open sourcerer who over the years has been involved in too many projects to enumerate. He started in FLOSS one fateful night many moons ago through a friendly interaction with a maintainer on an IRC channel of what was then the Mifos project. Ever since, he has been actively supporting the humanitarian open source platform for financial inclusion that is now known as Apache Fineract in a volunteer capacity. Currently employed by Google, previously at Red Hat, this talk is given in a purely personal capacity.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,480
okay

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,760
without further ado i think that we know

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
uh michael michael it's uh it works at

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,960
google

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,600
it previously works at red hat it's one

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
of our

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
start contributors on finrac and he's

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,320
helping a lot on

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,160
on the community and driving the

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,559
innovations and driving

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
and put some order and put some passion

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,640
and put some

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,440
discipline on on on finrac

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,360
i i saw your contributions on the email

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,600
list and i think that there is a lot of

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,559
things that i don't see because i'm

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,120
i'm not on the on the development side

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,680
so

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
uh he's going to talk about really great

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
in the community

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,720
so michael the floor is yours

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,080
thank you thank you thank you for your

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,119
for your kind words

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,200
you're being very generous um

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,880
i um throwing in here that this

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
presentation is uh

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,799
unrelated to my day job at work with

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,080
that i was away

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,040
um you all know what apache finrac is

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,520
so i don't think we need to dwelve too

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,799
long on

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
on this um what i want to talk about in

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,560
this presentation for the next uh

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,000
40 minutes i think i got is um

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
not so much about what i do for the

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
community but but uh what others do and

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,799
how come that

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,720
um in the last 12 months or so

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,720
we got a noticeable spike of

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,799
contributions right this graph here is

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,560
quite interesting the project started

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,280
got incubated at apache

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
a number of years ago actually this

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,399
graph shows

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,360
not since the apache incubation but the

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
original

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,680
git code even before that i believe very

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,160
heavy activities originally

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,920
then sort of a period of quiet very

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,360
quiet around here and then a sudden

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,800
spike of activities

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
in the last 12 months and i want to look

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,280
a little bit at what we did

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,920
as a community to uh to make that happen

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,879
right to reinvigorate our community

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,000
um community doesn't just happen putting

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,080
a

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
source code on a github repo and hoping

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,879
that people will show up is not quite

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,080
how it works

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,160
um but i believe that there are certain

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
things we can do you can do as a

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
community

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,360
to

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,080
get contributions and make people part

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,560
of your

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,319
of your community this is using finrac

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,239
as an example

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
but i think most of the lessons here are

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
not that specific

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,959
to a patch of interact but are perhaps

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,680
reusable for other

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,680
apache and general open source projects

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,360
i want to start with

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,360
something very basic very uh

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
kind of obvious but but that's worth

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,080
remembering um

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,599
it's super important uh to be very very

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
welcoming right

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,360
i think it's easy for us to forget how

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,800
confusing open source can be if you're

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
new to it

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,120
um if we've been doing this for a while

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
um

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
we find it obvious there's pull requests

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,040
and there's a mailing list but

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,319
the whole process around it like how

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,319
does this work

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,840
what do i have to do here who is telling

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,000
me what i should do

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,080
am i allowed to change code can i just

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
change any code oh i really can change

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
the code

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,280
people will actually review my code

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,799
people i don't know will review my code

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,280
i can have an impact on this project

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,920
by contributing my own new features my

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,799
own

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,519
bug fixes for it um to some people this

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,560
is obvious

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,080
but i over the years have learned that

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
too many it's actually not

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,040
i think this is something we forget

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,640
sometimes especially those of us with

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,640
technical backgrounds

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,959
um i like to uh remember

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,840
that everybody started somewhere and

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,599
perhaps sometimes think back to how you

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,799
started in my own case actually

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,040
i started with contributing to miphos

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,840
back when it was um in a different

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
incarnation

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,520
um there was an ifc channel somebody

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
guided me along with that irc channel

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,000
and sort of

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
taught me a little bit how to use some

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
git commands it had just migrated to git

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
at that time

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,320
and um that was very helpful so i still

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
um

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
from time to time remember that and

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,280
tried to do the same thing

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,600
for uh new people 10 years later

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
um it really does matter i think there

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,240
is a fine line of sort of

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
pushing somebody to not want to engage

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,199
in a community

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,759
uh by being a little too abrupt um and

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,120
by making somebody want to come back and

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,720
raise more pull requests

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,080
that you set the tone for at the very

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
beginning of an engagement the first

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
time somebody shows up on your project's

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
mailing list

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,960
the first reactions on a pull request i

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
do believe they really make a difference

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,680
be extra welcoming humble encouraging

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,720
friendly just generally nice

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,520
is one important element of

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,520
building community

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
i think other than being just generally

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,960
nice and sort of friendly

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,600
there are a few concrete things that we

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,720
can do

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,880
as a community um one thing is the whole

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,120
model of how we interact with uh with

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,039
country with contributors

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,440
so perhaps others

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
have had the same experience it's fairly

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
common for people who are vocal on

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,520
mating list to get private emails

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
many people are not that familiar with

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,960
this idea of public mailing lists

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,320
and prefer speaking to you privately i

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
regularly get uh

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,160
emails from people who reach out who are

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,400
basically asking

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,199
if i can help them to whether it's set

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,400
up a server or whether it's

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,400
run the code one thing we

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
like to do there is to use that as an

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,360
opportunity to

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,199
educate people how to use public mailing

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,520
lists right

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,600
again that's not that obvious if you've

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,759
never been on a mailing list

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
if you are used to facebook and twitter

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
um

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,080
you might be um

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,039
pulled off pushed off sorry by the

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,039
notion of getting that many emails

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,160
so explaining that you can filter and

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
search for emails

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,280
explaining that you can look for emails

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
that were addressed to you

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,600
and just basically handhold explain i've

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
done this more than once and i think it

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,840
makes

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
it makes a difference to open the doors

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,199
of your community

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
if people don't get it just re-explain

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
it very kindly say like look

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,720
i'd like to help you but i prefer doing

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,960
this on a public list

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
instead of a direct email exchange it

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,240
makes a difference

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,560
another thing is this whole idea of

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,440
giving people the background to

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
solutions

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,120
right it's one thing to um

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
tell somebody here is how you've solved

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,599
your problem like

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,919
i don't know i can't build it on saying

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,440
well you need to use java 11 instead of

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,919
java 8

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
it's better to explain to people in as

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,000
much detail as you have time for

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,759
why something is the way it is so

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,280
somebody posts a bug report

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
point them to the source code there's a

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,000
chance that they might go looking for

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,400
the source code

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,240
an error message point them at where the

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
error message actually said

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,440
what the problem was so that the next

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
time they

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,840
probably learn how to read error

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,680
messages

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,039
um this has a double effect of

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
the person you're talking to in your

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,360
community but

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,240
also informing people who are reading

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,520
along

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,800
i think we sometimes underestimate the

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,400
amount of people who are basically just

00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
reading a long list right there's a

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,000
silent

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
uh group of people who is sort of seeing

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,400
what's going on on lists okay what is

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,919
this

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
and if you on your community

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,199
interactions very verbally explain

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,080
um solutions to problems you can help

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
your community grow

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,000
right there's a little trick i use

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
sometimes that is not to always fully

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,280
solve a problem

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,759
it's easy of course if somebody comes

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,560
along and just fixes something for you

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,759
but giving hints to people and really

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
empowering them

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,080
to find the last step of the solution

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,320
themselves i think is a very

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,120
um good measure of building community

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,599
uh give perhaps hints to source code

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,640
like

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,240
this error is uh probably something in

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,760
java class so and so

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,519
link to github perhaps

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,160
you would like to try xyz

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,600
some fix instead of just going ahead and

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,360
fixing if you know the solution

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,720
even if you could say in the email

00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
exactly how to fix it

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,760
i think you're probably helping your

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,480
community grow better

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,120
by teaching your contributors and your

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,519
interested

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
users how they can fish themselves

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
instead of doing all the fishing for

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,279
them right

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,440
a completely different thing is that

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
it's really important

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
in in open source projects to make it

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,920
very easy to try

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
your your code your project again this

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,760
seems trivial

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:31,279
this is something that um we uh

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,680
we underestimate i think um thinner act

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,680
uh 12 months ago supposedly was easy

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,800
right you can

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
clone the source code you can build the

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
war file

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,600
you can deploy the war file into a

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
tomcat after you edit the

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
xml file of the data source we already

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,839
lost some people there

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
right 12 months later we had some great

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,240
contributions

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,399
petrie really made a difference there

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,680
big shout out to you

00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,160
we can now run gradle boot run

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,360
in one command and everything runs we

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,320
have a

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,399
docker compose file uh podman is the

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,800
same thing as docker but better so

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,640
use podman instead of docker podman

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,880
compose build putman compose up and you

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,160
get a full instance with a database with

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
a front end running

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,360
these things make a difference right the

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,800
easier it is

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,240
to the lower the barrier to entry is to

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,680
try out

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,959
a pro product like finrac

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,360
the the more you get people motivated to

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:31,360
actually

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,519
try it out and perhaps make

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,839
contributions afterwards

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,360
related to that of course is uh making

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,480
it easy to actually see the software

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,040
running

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,160
so since six months or so we got uh

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
finrac.dev

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
a site where the finra source code

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,079
actually runs live

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
i'm always updated there's a separate

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,079
talk about this day after tomorrow that

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
i'm giving

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,079
i think that's part of this idea of

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,360
making it easy for people to get started

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,680
in your community

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
if you just want to know what finrac is

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
you

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
perhaps don't want to start building it

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
yourself but if there's a link you can

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
click in the readme of the project

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
where you can see the thing running and

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,600
try it out

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,360
you gained a few hours there to get

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
somebody interested in your project

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
and that's i think that's really

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
important

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,959
moving on um

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,440
about pull requests uh two or three

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,079
points here

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,760
finrac used to have many uh open

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,079
unattended two pull requests

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,760
um that's typically a bad thing if

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
you're a new contributor and you see

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,200
that there's a huge backlog

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,519
of open pull requests that were ignored

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
you're likely gonna be less motivated to

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,120
jump on a project right

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
why would i add something to a project

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,839
where there is already 100 things that

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,200
nobody seems to care about

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,760
so for maintainers of a project to

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,680
actively groom the backlog of pull

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,000
request i think is fairly important

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,680
to reinvigorate a community it's

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,399
something we did over the last 12 months

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,560
actively

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,399
and i think that's another reason and

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,839
part of why why we managed to get

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,720
contributions going again

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,000
um tending to uh open pull requests has

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
several aspects

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,959
um reviewing them um i

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
personally think it's okay to expect

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,720
quality in pull requests so this

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
isn't about you know somebody just

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
pressing the merge button

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
when when people contribute things but

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,160
actually looking

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,360
at what is being proposed um have some

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,519
constructive feedback always

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,240
constructive um

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,680
of course when we review code um we are

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,079
taking into account

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,240
that different people have different um

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,399
experiences and backgrounds

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
so careful not to sort of block pull

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
requests just forever and

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
fall into this analysis paralysis trap

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,279
right

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,720
pull request merge that's done is better

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,600
than a perfect one

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,200
that just never gets merged careful also

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,720
not to get too much into nitpicking i

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,160
think we made great progress in finrak

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,079
about this so nitpicking is the idea of

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,440
saying this is indented wrong and

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,519
you should add a new line here or

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,720
something with mantan's great work from

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,399
the summer of code

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
project we now have automated code

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,320
formatting and uh

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,959
code style checks which make builds fail

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,920
uh if somebody doesn't format their

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,680
source code and that

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,040
means that a human doesn't have to come

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,800
and nitpick about that

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,240
that that helps and i think building

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,320
community

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
it's also okay to close old pull

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
requests right

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,040
if somebody doesn't react to uh review

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,320
feedback just go ahead and close them

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
they can always be reopened that's

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,519
probably okay

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,199
um back to the point made earlier on

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,720
mailing lists on handholding that's

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
particularly important on pull requests

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,600
as well

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,800
again i think we forget how not obvious

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,199
it may be

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,399
for new contributors how to see why a

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,120
build failed

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,040
um where is the log file why is this

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,320
pull request read what does that mean

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
if you're doing this for the very first

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,920
time it's actually not obvious at all

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
so for maintainers to

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
really kindly guide along people who are

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,480
making their first contributions

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,880
is super key to growing community

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,560
something i used to do years ago and

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,680
have moved away from

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,360
is fixing up people's pull requests so

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,040
if somebody throws a pull request

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
through a project and says here is a fix

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,560
for something and it doesn't build

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
and you might ask do you want to fix it

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
here's what is failing

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,199
i don't know check style is wrong or

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,519
something and years ago

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,560
i used to then basically pull those

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,880
contributions and

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,959
and fix them and over the years i've

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,920
come to the conclusion that is

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,360
counterproductive

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
i think it's ultimately better for a

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,839
project

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,320
if you help people to learn how to

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,560
contribute and

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
if they ignore the feedback then it's

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,760
probably not important enough for them

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,560
right it's probably not important enough

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,399
to make the contribution to the project

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,160
and by

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,440
basically fixing up things you're

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,839
sending the wrong signal

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
so meanwhile we're letting pull requests

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,160
occasionally

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,600
expire on on finrac and i think uh

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,079
for the long-term liability of a project

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
that is actually the better approach

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,720
after i've changed my opinion about

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,519
that's a little bit

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,320
um this is an example of something that

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,199
happened

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
recently right here somebody interested

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,199
in contributing to the project seems to

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,199
have found a bug

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
about something that should be changed

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,600
in the line uh

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
543 of this savings accounts charge

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,440
class here

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,519
but actually comments on the uh

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,959
the code on github without raising a

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,160
pull request it's just sort of an inline

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,440
comment i'm actually not even

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,079
sure exactly how one does that

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
technically um so the right thing here

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,519
is to very

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,959
friendly leave a comment and say like um

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,279
thank you very much for your interest

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
but

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,120
um we really need a pull request for

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,399
this not just a comment

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
and here is how you go about doing this

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
maybe add a friendly link say like if

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,160
you've never done this before here's how

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,880
you can learn how to do it

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,240
very simple kind of basic measures but

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,000
which help to grow community and get

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,279
some people are interested in

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,639
contributing you'll also lose some

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,079
people right some people might ignore

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
this and might not come back that's fine

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,360
that's totally fine right

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
as a maintainer of an open source

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,360
project you

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,160
uh do the best you can to help people on

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
board

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,800
and you'll win some and you'll lose some

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
that's totally fine

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,880
um another aspect on building community

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,320
growing community

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,759
is um the old question of

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,560
i think this is an interesting project

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,160
where can i help right how do you

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,160
actually find

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
things to do for contributors on a

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,279
project

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
of course people can ask on mailing

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,959
lists not everybody will people might be

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,000
shy people might not want to

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,120
post one thing that works really well

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
that of course other open source

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,480
projects do as well have a list of

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,839
beginner issues

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,279
and create that list um we set this up

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,240
we used to have it always but it wasn't

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,240
super clear

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,079
infiner act and we used to have

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,360
different tags on jira

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,079
and uh sometime this summer i went about

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,319
and set up this jira dashboard

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,240
with a clear unique tag so just a

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,799
beginner tag not starter

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,679
not begin not easy or something but

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,760
let's just

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,039
all all contributors all maintainers

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,039
let's use the same tag

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,799
the beginner tag and this seems to work

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,480
people occasionally come to this page

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,320
and find

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,600
on the jira dashboard that we now have

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,360
on the asf jira

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,960
the first list of issues in the upper

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,720
left-hand corner on our dashboard

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,840
which is recommended beginner issues

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,520
currently 20 issues or issues on it

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,520
that's a way to help people get started

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,559
i think showing people also what's going

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,400
on is important

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,840
right you might be more motivated to

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
work on something if you see that other

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,600
people are working in related areas

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,600
i'm just doing a time check here yeah

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,720
we're good and um

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,799
that's something else that we have on

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
our dashboard

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,480
in the middle of our new jira dashboard

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,640
on apache phenox

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
um the activity stream where you can see

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,760
oh somebody else has

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,080
self-assigned an issue oh somebody has

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,200
closed an issue really sort of

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:18,000
feel the beat of the project

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,960
another tab uh another list on that

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
dashboard

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,679
is what issues got resolved um

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,440
discussions on issues are one thing but

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,039
ultimately we want people to actually

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,240
make contributions and solve issues and

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
close issues right

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,840
so the list of results issues um and

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,320
seeing how

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,520
uh issues get added here and you just

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,320
get closed

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,960
um is is another way to show people that

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,200
your project is moving and to

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,320
inspire them to want to be one of them

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,320
who closes issues

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,360
as you get people who start contributing

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,400
there is

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,080
an important small practical measure

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,640
that i think is super important in open

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
source right

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,240
we have different kinds of contributors

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,679
but in finrax case there are a number of

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,799
people who do this as volunteers

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,679
or who do this as a aside from their job

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,280
like their their job maybe some work

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
related to finra act but making an

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,960
upstream contribution is more sort of a

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,320
personal thing that they do

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,039
i think saying thank you for every

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,840
contribution celebrating successes

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,120
small successes this is great uh it's

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,559
cool that we have this contribution

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,440
thanks for this bug fix

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,559
um it's it's hard to do too much of that

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,679
right

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,440
it's cheap it's quick um just do it for

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,080
your projects for your communities

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
uh be be grateful show that gratefulness

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
as a maintainer

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,240
and i think it helps right there's

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,440
nothing

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,880
there's nothing um it's gratifying to to

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,280
to get thanks like that

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,600
um we tried something out in finra act

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,600
that i want to give a shout out to

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,880
at some point earlier this year it

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,360
occurred to me why not

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,799
just having a thank you email every week

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,640
it wasn't that complicated i gave it

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,440
some thought how to make this as easy as

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,120
possible

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:13,280
for maintainers and

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,360
came to the conclusion that with

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
jira issue subscription this is actually

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,520
pretty easy to do

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,880
so we have a finrac resolved last week

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,280
filter

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,240
and a subscription that sends the list

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,360
of issues that were

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
resolved in the last week i

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,720
i couldn't quite get it to automatically

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
send to the dev list so it sends it to

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
me and i forward it but it literally

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,960
takes three seconds right

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
let's forward the list hey thanks

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
everyone who made a contribution last

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,000
week

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,960
issues closed um it's easy it's cheap

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,600
it's nice

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,799
it helps people keep informed about

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,760
what's

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,000
been happening in community it seems to

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,679
me

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,280
that we have people who are following

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,799
along on the mailing list

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,320
more so than on the github repo

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:01,760
so if you're not following every

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,720
review on the on the github repo

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,080
you don't have to watch the repo but

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,360
being subscribed to the mailing list

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
getting occasional updates on what's

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,799
going on in the community

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
this is a nice way and it shows

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,600
gratitude of the project

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
to contributors a slightly different

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,360
aspect

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,600
um is uh making

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,760
open source contributions uh a very

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,799
friendly competition

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,600
um this is not about

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,480
who sort of does the most contributions

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,960
or who has the

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,799
the the most lines or something but this

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,960
is a an aspect that is common in most

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,240
open source communities right

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,159
some of you would have noticed that on

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,159
github there's a page somewhere

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,840
that shows um who contributed how much

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,080
that shows over time you could sort of

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,919
do these filtering things on github

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,520
um that's part of the open source

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,080
culture and there's nothing wrong with

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,080
it

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,840
um a bit of friendly friendly

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,679
competition supportive competition never

00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,000
hurt anyone that's totally cool

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:04,400
one of the boxes that we have on again

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,480
the jira dashboard that we set up

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
that is available at the i think first

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,880
or second link of the apache of interact

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,159
readme

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,120
that dashboard there's a list of

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,919
total issues resolved not over the last

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,000
week or so but

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,480
lifetime i think some people

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,600
get a kick out of looking at that and

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,799
and that's

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
very much part of the open source

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,799
culture larger communities do this you

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,280
can find online of course

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,159
stats of which con companies contributed

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,559
how much to

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,799
whatever it is linux channel firefox

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,720
your favorite open source project

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,000
doing a bit of that in your community in

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,080
our case here for apache

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,320
finrac i think doesn't hurt

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,320
um a completely different topic

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,240
we at some point started setting up

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,440
automation for apache fino act and

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,159
i have a feeling that

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,080
has something to do with some of the

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,080
reinvigoration that we saw

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,440
in our community that's something worth

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,240
talking about here for a minute or two

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,480
on this slide so artificial intelligence

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,320
is hitting the world bots steal jobs

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,559
make bots work for you right in software

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,159
development there's a number of things

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,760
you can automate and you should automate

00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,600
in your projects

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
um i think i've already mentioned before

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
the work that manthan's been doing for

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,360
format and quality

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,480
checks others have helped with this as

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,720
well

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,320
finra act some are interns i hope i'm

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,600
not i'm not forgetting

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
the various contributions that have been

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,880
made over the summer here

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,880
but we have automated dependency updates

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
we've set up the renovate bot that

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,039
basically goes around and says like

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
hello

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,120
here is a third party dependency that

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,200
could be updated

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,039
sometimes they don't work sometimes a

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,679
human has to

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,360
look at why version bump isn't working

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,400
but the fact that a bot is proposing

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,440
them for you

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,840
is reducing work

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,679
for human contributors but i think the

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,200
more important point is

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
is that it keeps a bit of activity on

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,000
the project going

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,039
so if you get a failed pull request from

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,520
a bot

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,279
um that's probably something that would

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,279
have taken longer for

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,799
contributors to remember to upgrade and

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,600
and to

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,640
do something about an action um bots can

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,080
really help

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,840
whether it's for third-party upgrades

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,679
whether it's format um

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,440
code quality checks we added a lot of

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,400
code quality checks in infinite over the

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,480
summer we now have

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,760
error-prone we now have find bugs

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,919
we now have i think we don't have the

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,919
security one but that's an open issue

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,240
there is also a bot that we set up a few

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,039
months ago that

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,159
basically checks for stale old unaction

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,159
pull requests

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,279
again something that helps the project

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720
to

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,720
to keep traction so why not save

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,720
maintainers work

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,120
and have a bot comment on hello this

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,440
bull request has not been

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,039
updated in a week or two or four

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
whatever the the frequencies you choose

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,919
for your project

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,520
um in finrac we set it to four weeks

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,120
and then after another four weeks or two

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,240
full months and we actually

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,200
automatically cause

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,159
pull requests now um that's that's

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
helpful it

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,520
reduces manual work and it keeps the

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
project

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,799
active and alive even without

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,279
maintainers having to

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,880
to do work there there is actually a

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,720
bunch of these automations there's a

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,919
framework called probot that you can use

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,240
to write your own

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,080
uh bots if you want to get really fancy

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,000
there

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,200
the title of the slide here is cheat

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,400
with a bit of a

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
joke um i don't think this is cheating

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,039
right this helps

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,559
keeping project active and adds real

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,559
value that's totally fair

00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,080
a completely different topic um for

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,200
reinvigorating communities um it's

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,679
really important to

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
regularly release um this is something

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,480
we did badly in

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,600
in finra act um totally fair also to

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:15,120
to recognize where we can improve um

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,960
i think our 1.4 release was long overdue

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,720
and thanks again to a volunteer stepping

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
up here thanks alex

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,720
we managed to get that out of the door

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,080
um perhaps sometimes as

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,120
developers and maintainers of a

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,320
community it's easy to underestimate the

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
importance

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,440
of getting releases out end users do

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,919
value

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,559
stable releases i put stable in quotes

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,240
here

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,320
because um the finract code base now

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,960
that we have continuous

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,559
builds technically is already fairly

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,480
stable every day right

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,480
it's not like our build is broken or we

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,919
have like major features completely

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,200
broken our integration tests would

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,240
already cover that

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,360
and and detect that many time

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,320
so theoretically cutting a release is

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,799
just a snapshot in time

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,840
but practically people really seem to

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,840
seem to find this useful

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,159
something that we've discussed on a jira

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,480
issue here of interact 876

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,480
is whether releases could be further

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,799
automated

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,600
some some days i wonder whether um we

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,720
could

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,440
even move to a fixed um

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,200
time box scan release schedule right

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,720
like how crazy would it be to think that

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
every two months or every three months

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,559
or whatever

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,559
the frequency we would decide as a

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,240
community there would be a finrax

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,640
release cut

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,240
um people contribute their pull requests

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,840
and you basically know that whatever you

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,399
contribute within a month or two or

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,279
three

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,480
is available in a in a release um i

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,600
think it's something for us to

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,600
to consider and uh

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,840
as we go into 2021 um

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,279
and and cut more frequent releases our

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,559
our end users which is what we really

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,120
want to reach right

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,039
we want to build a platform for

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,919
financial inclusion

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,440
and if we have merchant requests that

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,279
are not released

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,840
they're of less value to our eventual

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,840
end users

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,320
um

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,159
how do we a few slides two or three

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,360
slides more on on the people front of

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,320
things now slightly switching gears here

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,960
uh so you've got a community you got

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
project

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,039
um you've set up a jira dashboard you've

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,360
got uh

00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,399
understood that you're going to be

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,399
helpful for

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,200
for people who want to do something

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,320
there's another angle right there's also

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,520
asking people to do things and

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,440
this is an interesting this is an

00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,039
interesting um

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
angle of managing an open source

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,399
community um

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,159
i semi jokingly here put us the first

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,200
line on the slide it's free to ask

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,640
people

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,679
um and and it's true right

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,080
it's something maybe to remember

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,080
sometimes if there is something that

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,799
needs doing i don't know some bug or

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,880
some

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,919
build that's failed or some pull request

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,760
that needs

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
reviews or whatever it is that needs

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,520
doing in in your community at the day

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,000
um just asking people is is fine right

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,039
if people are in your community they

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,240
they want to help and if you know of

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,039
something that

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,480
needs to get done and there are people

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,000
who want to do things that don't know

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,720
what's the next urgent thing

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,919
the next most useful thing to do just

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,360
ask

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,679
the most important thing is probably

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,320
never to um

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,799
expect somebody to have to do something

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,720
for you

00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,679
right if you work as a volunteer in an

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,679
open source community

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
it's inappropriate to say fix this for

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
me

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,320
but saying this looks like something you

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,159
may be interested in fixing is a

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,039
completely different thing

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,640
very respectfully um also fairly

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,720
specifically and clearly like

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,760
this doesn't work is this something you

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,840
would have time to fix for me

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,000
it might not work always people are busy

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,600
people have lives on the volunteer side

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,240
this is different in other projects

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,240
where people are

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,799
have corporate backings to work on

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,480
things and there's perhaps more of an

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,720
organization in the background that

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,240
schedules things but in a

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,279
volunteer-driven project

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
it's super important to just communicate

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,559
and ask

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,919
that's totally fair totally fine um if

00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,120
you expect to be ignored

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,000
sometimes you won't be in order to do

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,360
that it helps

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,840
to know your community just kind of

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
drink of it

00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,919
if um as a maintainer on an open source

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,679
project

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
you know a little bit who is who on your

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,480
community um of course that makes it

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,120
easier

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,520
to uh basically

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,720
proud people in a sense and friendly

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,150
friendly ask hey do you want to help

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,919
with this

00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,519
[Music]

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,519
um moving on

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,640
still on the people front right

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,760
you do want to keep your community

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,480
growing you do want to keep

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,000
new committers joining this is something

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,399
that's really worked for us

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,279
in finrac over the last 12 months again

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,760
some of the

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,880
leading contributors that emerged and

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,159
have been invited to

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,600
to become committers um

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,519
it's something not every project gets

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,320
right i think there is a history in open

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,600
source

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,279
of people being very protective

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,080
of theirs of their code and like

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
this is ours or mine or this is not

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,840
something that we would

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,679
like we welcome people contributing but

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,279
but we don't want people to

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,279
have the full privileges of

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,480
committership

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
i think it's important to strike the

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,200
right balance there and i think

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,039
infineoct at least over the last 12

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,960
months we got it right

00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,559
i think we have opened our doors and

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,919
added actually several

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,440
a handful of new committers um

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,240
i think it is a balance right um so in

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,039
your project

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,600
if you kind of open the doors too wide

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,679
and

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,880
and just basically make everybody who

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,880
commits uh

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,080
uh one fix and who raises a pull request

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,399
to be a committer

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,080
you potentially get more work dealing

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,440
with quality issues

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,559
so balancing out where it makes sense to

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,640
add new committers and where

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,159
people perhaps need a bit more time to

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,279
learn the open source way

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:35,279
to be able to make effective committers

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:38,559
is is fair game in open source

00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,320
contributing quality code that is

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,320
actually merged

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,240
and over a sustained period that does

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,559
matter right that is the bar

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:52,159
in in uh open source committer ship

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,640
um one practical

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,200
signal for for any open source project

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,000
uh

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,960
to promote somebody to committer is

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
people who start

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
to chime in on other people's pull

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
requests right

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,559
i think there's this switch people

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
start working on open source with their

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,960
own things

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,080
you come because either you want to fix

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,480
a problem or a contributing enhancement

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,480
that you have or your organization have

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,159
maybe those who pay your bills have

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,840
um and at some point you become

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,919
part of the community and have this

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,720
reflex of like oh somebody else proposed

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,440
something

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,679
let me look at what that is right that's

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,000
a tipping point i think in the

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,559
uh evolution of open source contributors

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,080
when you don't only care about what you

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,320
want out of the project

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,840
but when you become interested in the

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,880
well-being of the project and you

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,200
realize that

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,000
in order to do that you can play a role

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,039
and help

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,440
review other people's code nobody's

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,080
gonna

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,159
ask for that nobody says you have to

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,039
review somebody else's code these things

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,960
tend to emerge organically in healthy

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,880
open source communities

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,720
and people like that are definitely

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,039
those who should be promoted committers

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,159
very

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,040
very quickly completely different topic

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,040
how am i doing on time

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:18,320
that's fine right four minutes

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,800
um stepping back sometimes in open

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,000
source

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:27,359
as a maintainer it's important to know

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,800
when to give space to others

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,639
it's probably better for your community

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,760
right knowing

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,839
knowing when you want to leave space for

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,440
others to to do something

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,320
i'll let you in a little secret this is

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,599
what happened with defender 1.4 release

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,320
um i at some point this summer made the

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,040
decision that

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,639
uh if finra needs to release then there

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,919
should be somebody somewhere in the

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,200
community who has an interest in

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,960
stepping up to do that

00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,800
and of course we found somebody of

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,000
course um

00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,599
alex you you stepped up and let that

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,599
and uh that's healthy right and if

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,599
nobody steps up to continue maintaining

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,000
things or to review code well

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,359
that's a sign that the community is

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,880
where it's at and

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,800
then it's perhaps fair if things get

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,240
slow or things don't happen

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,119
um it's probably better if if you know

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,320
things come out

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,920
instead of one or two heroes driving a

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,480
project alone

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,440
so no heroes culture their hashtag is

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,599
important for healthy

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,960
open source communities that thrive and

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,839
to

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,839
grow communities

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,920
slowly gonna wrap up here um i think

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,359
something

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,960
that's interesting to consider is why

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,359
you're in an open source project so this

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,280
is a

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,800
more personal front now less on on

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,000
individual projects

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,480
um for those of you listening in um

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,079
have you considered what makes you uh

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,839
contribute to a project

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,359
the various reasons and i think they're

00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,280
all fair i don't think any of them are

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,599
right or wrong or better or worse or

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,200
there's there's nothing like that

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,720
but it's interesting to consider that

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
for oneself right

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,079
why are you in an open source project is

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,400
it because you're learning how to code

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,240
is it because it's a volunteering

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,440
opportunity do you believe in a cause

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,480
is it just fun totally fair totally fair

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,680
you want to have some fun on

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,400
an interesting project cool but then do

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,240
it

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,960
for having fun right don't do it if it

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,960
frustrates you

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,079
if you want to learn totally fair

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,040
contribute as much time as you can to

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,079
learn

00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,359
read along other code and pull requests

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,000
and learn from it

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,400
as much as as it benefits your learning

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,760
are you paid to do it um is your boss

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,640
telling you to go fix a bug in an

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,200
upstream project

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,800
that's totally cool happens a lot um a

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,920
lot of the larger open source projects

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,000
are run like that

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,280
people don't force not don't necessarily

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,960
realize that

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,560
some people have a sort of idealized

00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,320
vision of open source

00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,480
but many large projects

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,520
run because there's commercial interest

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,760
behind it there's nothing wrong with

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,760
that

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,920
something to realize here is that being

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,280
friendly doesn't necessarily mean

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,560
bending backwards

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,320
bending over backwards to solve

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,880
everybody's problem right the first

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,520
slide there

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,560
that'd be welcoming be be uh be open as

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,440
a community

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,000
um i think for for volunteer

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,839
contributors it's totally fair also to

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,240
accept that they can help with some

00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,480
things and leave

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,920
some things unanswered perhaps others

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
will pick it up if the community is big

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,680
enough

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,320
or poor things will not not go answers

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,480
that

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,960
that is a healthy reflection of the

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,040
state of the community

00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,320
and i think i said said this before it's

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
in the project's best

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,720
long-term interest to teach a community

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,480
how to fish make it easy make it easy to

00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,079
fix bugs make it easy to contribute make

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,200
it easy to try out

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,400
uh things on a server or to

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:58,000
have a local instance running um

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,760
and and teach our efficiency going

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,400
phishing

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,079
i will end with a last slide um

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,079
an open source project such as apache

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,160
finrac

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,800
is uh open source in the sense that

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,920
anybody is free to use it look inside it

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,400
modify it

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,000
and free to actively contribute to it um

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,119
it doesn't necessarily mean

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
it's a free

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,760
package of software that you get free

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,280
support for and that somebody will run

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,280
for you for free

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,280
um that's that's sometimes important to

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,680
gently remind or clarify that's totally

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,920
okay um

00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,200
you want to be part of this community

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,960
because you understand

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,560
that together we're stronger that

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,720
everybody contributing

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,839
the features they need fixing the bugs

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,000
that affect them

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,480
ultimately creates a better software for

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,480
everybody

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,119
contributing to an open source project

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,880
is not just about code

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,320
if you help others on the mailing list

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,480
so if you respond to

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,520
people facing problems with the software

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,960
and the mailing list

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,160
if you contribute better documentation

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,480
to the projects just add test coverage

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,760
if you report bugs clear bug reports

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,599
this is broken

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,280
open a jira issue about it that's

00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,800
absolutely a way of contributing to open

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,040
source right

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,160
um uh more outward-facing activities

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,240
blogging about

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,839
uh features um organizing events

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,640
those are all ways of contributing to

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,640
open source right

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,640
um pretty much i think this is coming up

00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,880
on 40 minutes

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:41,760
there's a few links here on uh

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,560
community resources that are interesting

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,079
if you want to learn more about how to

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,839
successfully uh reinvigorate an open

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,200
source community

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,200
