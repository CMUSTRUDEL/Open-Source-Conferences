In this digital day and age, passwords are no longer adequate. Users worldwide are victims of multiple malfeasances like brute force attacks, injection attacks, phishing, unsafe credentials, data theft, among others. The flaws of using passwords - which have increasingly become predictable, leave users vulnerable to data and identity theft. Even the strongest passwords are easy to crack and prone to phishing nonetheless. Hence, given all these nuisances, thereâ€™s a need to eliminate character-based authentication protocols, which would ultimately benefit all developers as well as end-users. An implementation on Apache Fineract will also be presented.
