Description: 
	Running Fineract.dev like a Cloud Native SRE
Michael Vorburger

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

https://www.fineract.dev runs https://github.com/apache/fineract as a service. This talk will give a peek behind the curtain of how that has been set up, detailing e.g. http://blog2.vorburger.ch/2020/05/fineractdev-cicd-from-github-to-google.html etc. It will mention the details of that cloud's used services, but go easy on marketing the particular cloud (Google's) that Fineract.dev runs on. We will also lightly touch upon a few SRE principles from https://landing.google.com/sre/books, and mention some Cloud Native application architecture principles (hint: it's not all about microservices only).

Michael is a long time open sourcerer who over the years has been involved in too many projects to enumerate. He started in FLOSS one fateful night many moons ago through a friendly interaction with a maintainer on an IRC channel of what was then the Mifos project. Ever since, he has been actively supporting the humanitarian open source platform for financial inclusion that is now known as Apache Fineract in a volunteer capacity. Currently employed by Google, previously at Red Hat, this talk is given in a purely personal capacity.
