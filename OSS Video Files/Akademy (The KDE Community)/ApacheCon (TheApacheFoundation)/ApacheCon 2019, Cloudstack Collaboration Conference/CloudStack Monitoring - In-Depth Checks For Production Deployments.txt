Publication date: 2019-09-19
Playlist: ApacheCon 2019, Cloudstack Collaboration Conference
Description: 
	This talk is for CloudStack administrators who're responsible for maintaining a robust and fault-free production deployment. It covers monitoring fine grained parameters of a CloudStack installation and how to measure and check not just discrete values but also routinely performed actions against their expected outcome. It also dwells upon how the same discrete values make a difference from an access perspective. Whether you want to auto-resolve common problems, provide an SLA or just keep a tab on your deployment, this talk will definitely provide some insights.
