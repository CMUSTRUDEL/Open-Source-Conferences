Title: Anomaly Prediction in Apache CloudStack
Publication date: 2019-09-19
Playlist: ApacheCon 2019, Cloudstack Collaboration Conference
Description: 
	There is a chance of system, storage and network failures in the CloudStack environment at any point of time, which is unknown to the end users and administrators. The administrators are highly depend on the alert and monitoring system to raise an alarm on failures, upon the action is being taken. This can down the operations and will impact the end user services. The prediction of such failures ahead in CloudStack environment would be required instead of depending on the monitoring systems. Anomaly Prediction requires a model using the existing knowledge base and history of the CloudStack environment. This model would help in predicting the failures/abnormalities ahead of time. The necessary action is taken on these to minimize the down time or no down time, and making the CloudStack environment robust. The actions taken are learnt by the system and would automatically apply on the respective failures, make it a self-healing system.
