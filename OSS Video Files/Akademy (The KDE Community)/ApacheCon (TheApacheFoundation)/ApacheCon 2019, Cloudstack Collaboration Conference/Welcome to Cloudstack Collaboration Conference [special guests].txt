rest of the content you can see and also

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,489
to makes more bearable for you I've got

some special guests to come and talk to

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,670
you so that you don't have to spend all

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,160
the time some housekeeping from the

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,960
Apache foundation themselves there's a

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,930
plenary which has really interesting

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,009
really great people talking tomorrow in

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,380
Vista much or misters is one of the

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:12,389
larger ones I believe I heard from the

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,359
Apache guys they've had the second

00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:18,600
largest registration for this conference

00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,969
as a whole of all times in the last 20

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,609
years ago the second biggest they're

00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:26,520
hoping for so there should be really

00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,039
good we've got some evening events if

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,429
you look on the African website the

00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:35,240
first one being tonight a screening of a

00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:38,279
film that was down about open source

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,709
free software over time and how it's

00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:41,639
developed and also a preview of a film

00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,659
they're gonna be making there'll be

00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:47,609
people we've got Andrea and people doing

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,929
some filming of our CloudStack but

00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,810
there'll be some general filming going

00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:54,439
on as well and that's all going into a

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,999
documentary about the Apache foundation

00:01:54,439 --> 00:02:01,079
particularly last this particular

00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:04,319
anniversary year that is in Vista as

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,569
well then you've got the vo Patrick on

00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,469
run and so whole group of people will be

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,489
at 7 a.m.

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,680
compare getting together in the lobby

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:17,230
presumably also in lycra and if you ask

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,530
me insane but that's they'll be there

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:25,090
round with them and also they have asked

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:28,360
as well as we have our CCC 19 us kind of

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,690
hashtag and also you at cloud stack we

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,540
do use the clasp that works hashtag for

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,459
our stuff that's called tax doing Apache

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,709
vows also can you try to include either

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:44,049
after patch econ or a CNA 19 get to

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,450
first because obviously think they want

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:49,379
the wider world to see that this is part

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:52,299
of a patchy con and what's happening

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,860
don't drop the US on the end because I

00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:56,410
did have a look see see see nineteen

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,609
Italian cycling thing that happened

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:02,440
earlier this year so well I mean you can

00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:06,579
tweak them but they're probably less

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,459
interested also see on the housekeeping

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:13,480
side coming from England I'm going to

00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,069
speak English as I see it you're lucky

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,930
it's not a technical talk so I roof two

00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:20,319
verses router is not going to be an

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,299
issue for us but you'll have to bear in

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,849
mind that if I say they've done some use

00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:26,590
the elevator

00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:28,540
I'll see complaints to the Queen if how

00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,829
he's upstairs may keep playing poker or

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,579
something obviously you can drop off

00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:38,919
your complaint to him and he'll actually

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:41,410
pass them on for you so why we're here

00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:44,579
this we're here in this building with a

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,620
Patrick on it's their 20th anniversary

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:51,160
but the first collaboration conference

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,260
was down the road in the Venetian seven

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,819
years ago I think it was almost exactly

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,950
seven years ago roughing round about

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:59,380
this month next month

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:03,700
and we have so been part of the Apache

00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,569
foundation for seven seven years we've

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,310
started off of the year in the oddly

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:12,040
incubating and you've come all the way

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,959
through there and that kind of way we've

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,269
done it being part of Apache the Apache

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,459
way he's gonna be a theme throughout

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:24,490
really how its helps to achieve what we

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:27,159
have but I'll come back to them a bit so

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,229
the real reason you're here twenty two

00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:31,139
more presentations to come after this

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,930
opening one their stuff on

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,379
how to do things people's view of how

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,180
the future might look new features there

00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,279
people are working on new features that

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,800
they have developed and are all

00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,789
interesting stuff about what's coming

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,849
what is in cloud stat for people just

00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,240
talk about enjoy and see where we're

00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,900
going

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,629
so we've got today and tomorrow talks

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,240
think get up to about 6:30 7 o'clock

00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:03,870
most Dyson but full day's so that's two

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,370
traps in here nothing laughing lovely

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:11,729
one and two is just next door did think

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,430
they when you see into the schedule if

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:17,279
you filter for class that collaboration

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,189
conference it's not ordered thrown off

00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,080
live ones on the right left and the

00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,599
others on the other side they do switch

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,509
around so just make sure you check which

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,789
room it is that you want to be in and

00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:34,199
then we in here again have a hackathon

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:36,900
on Wednesday where people just get

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,680
together and talk through stuff they

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,210
want to talk through be what's happening

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,150
how we might do networking in some

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,560
particular way all sorts of stuff that

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,409
will come up that people will want to

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,449
talk get together with it can be code

00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,399
based it can be physical actually

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,979
hacking code together or it could be

00:05:53,399 --> 00:06:00,080
more generic more how we were going to

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:03,719
pull together to do a particular thing

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,219
that stays in here and I think Andrea or

00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:07,680
one of our guys also try and go around

00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:09,659
and talk to people and maybe interview

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,879
film if they're willing and asked about

00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:13,319
how people use cloud stack what they're

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,539
doing with cloud stacks and we've got

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:20,430
some of that kind of content to put up

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:22,740
as well and they want no lovely news or

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,409
some things a town about 120 K way so if

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,029
you're a big tipsy out on the strip tell

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:30,110
anyone that's where you want to go

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:31,919
because we what they won't end well

00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:34,939
that's it for me because I don't have

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,319
any funny story to tell other people

00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:42,209
okay so that's all the kind of

00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:45,060
background stuff now you got here loads

00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:48,060
of really interesting really informative

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,220
facts and they're actually going to do

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,350
true so I thought what I'd do is reset

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,960
you so that you're in this position with

00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,100
okay now I know are not true ears and

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,110
I'm hearing this stuff so I know how

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,810
much better all this true stuff that I'm

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:01,889
gonna hear is so we'll start with some

00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,930
fake news

00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:09,330
just to get us warmed up so obviously no

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,410
talk about breakfast or president Trump

00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,780
for the rest of the week

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,150
everyone's agreed signed a pact who

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:20,580
having none of that because frankly I'm

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:22,380
sick of it too yeah we thought you know

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,450
we get all the kids we're on the kids

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,540
using class that so we've got some

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:32,760
emojis so we're gonna have an emoji

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:39,210
language started full that's how it

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:43,590
works and then obviously our special

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:47,700
guest and well everyone knows that's not

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:50,280
true Sweeney the residency I think a few

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,390
months ago that though I may have

00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,020
oversold how will I know share so yeah

00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,680
that might come back to bite me later

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,090
cool so after all that so for the record

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,050
that is the end of fact news everything

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:09,270
else is actually real just there so

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,080
let's get on and try and be a little bit

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:15,479
more everyone likes some some numbers to

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,050
get going it wouldn't be a starting

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:21,990
presentation without numbers so I had a

00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:25,020
look on github I think transferred if

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:37,560
you have coinciding rough round about

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:39,630
where we move in the fan page okay so so

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,849
yeah I think the transfer to github

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,219
occurred roughly around my remove the

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:47,279
Apache foundation piece so from there

00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:49,580
we've got over 32,000 commits got in

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,010
there definitely for

00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:55,500
297 individual committees so you know

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,889
there's a big sport broad spectrum of

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,899
people committing to this right now as

00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,049
fishel Apache committees we have one

00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:09,720
hundred and twenty one of them of those

00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:11,699
51 RPM C members and say coming down ten

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,499
because I think I've got those right

00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:15,239
those rule I don't even know I order

00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:17,339
because I remember them I think there's

00:09:15,239 --> 00:09:21,809
a case of if you remember the Amsterdam

00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:24,809
one you weren't there for we have been

00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:29,459
part of Apache council their foundations

00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:30,600
were rough in seven years six VP's we've

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:33,209
had so far

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,299
chip who did off the unloads work

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:40,609
getting us actually into as a top-level

00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:47,579
project followed by Sebastian Hugo will

00:09:40,609 --> 00:09:49,350
might Taos key and then just and of

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,329
course I got I can't I was trying to

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,449
think of a number was well then he goes

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:58,919
oh one for Patrick CloudStack so that

00:09:54,449 --> 00:10:00,959
was my things but we've also you know

00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:03,899
we're I think we went through a phase

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,949
where we we had if you like fallow years

00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,660
where there was still loads of

00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:10,579
development going on but weren't getting

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:14,029
it out there but in the last year for

00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:16,529
eleven was already out by the time

00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:19,049
conference in Montreal but from there

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,779
we've continued and updated for eleven

00:10:19,049 --> 00:10:24,449
to give you 11 to 11 three just recently

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:27,029
so we're keeping up with that LTS idea

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,129
that people can go to a version and

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:32,339
they're not gonna have to do relatively

00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:34,230
large bigger version upgrades where new

00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,429
features come in they can be happy in

00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:41,789
there where they are and move forward

00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,089
safely for 12 was out to three months

00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:46,379
ago

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:49,529
and for 13 should be out within days and

00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,199
weeks when photogate firm it's just down

00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:54,179
to the administrative bits at the back

00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:56,269
end to get websites updated the

00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,259
announcements out and what-have-you and

00:10:56,269 --> 00:11:00,119
largely depends how interesting new

00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,189
lighting because if you're really boring

00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:03,419
in your talks then I'd loads of time to

00:11:02,189 --> 00:11:05,339
get that sorted if you actually

00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:10,380
interesting them it's going to take

00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:13,200
longer and we we're putting this slide

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,510
Matan sawfish thousands of package

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,700
downloads a month we people are

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:21,600
downloading cloud stat from all over the

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,670
world people are trying it out and the

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,240
conversion ratio we don't get to see

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,280
unfortunately but we'll also hear now

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,670
that actually we convert more than we

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,670
know and some surprising things come out

00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:40,530
for so from all we do and I'll get into

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,260
why we have a lot to be proud of a bit

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:47,190
more we do have a lot to be proud of I

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,680
kind of put something up there and

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,930
people who know me know I don't like

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,520
hyperbole or hyperbole going on outside

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:56,730
the Atlantic you come from

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,860
I don't suffer fools gladly so if I if I

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:05,280
honestly think we should be proud of it

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:07,110
then probably it's a quite good line was

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:13,500
hard to find out of the shadows picture

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:16,410
that didn't seem a bit just scary it's

00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,810
paying dividends what we're doing is

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,300
getting to be seen more in the outside

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,590
world now outside of our little clouds

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,740
that bubble where we've always thought

00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:29,040
it was great thought we were the bee's

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:32,520
knees if now it's now starting to get

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,390
out to the wider world in some ways and

00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,800
obviously over the next couple of days

00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,210
hearing what people are up to hearing

00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,460
where people would go with clouds that

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:44,520
we'll be able to you know enforce within

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,620
ourselves that the idea that cloud stack

00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,200
actually is not just gonna still hanging

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,840
on but he's still going forward doing

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,280
more pushing boundaries saying what

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,690
should you do next what should we be

00:12:53,280 --> 00:13:00,570
next and and that's going to be a big

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:03,000
thing to take and part of the hashtags

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,240
is tweeting that out showing the outside

00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,160
world that that's happening is a big

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,690
thing as well

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:16,949
um this is yeah it's a bit of a cheap

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:21,269
shot so but it is a genuine quote I'm

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:23,850
sure the guys here know it is a genuine

00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:25,170
quote from third-party vendor who

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,680
actually is getting more more involved

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,959
in clouds that they have just a month or

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,000
two ago Haider

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:35,759
developers specifically to be working on

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,370
clouds that specifically to be making

00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,100
their storage work with clouds back to

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,230
see how plastic does stuff and trade

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:48,389
drivers and a plug-in to make that fast

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:52,350
and better they see that has a better

00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:54,629
better way of leveraging their their hot

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:59,699
software their their storage software

00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:03,259
then don't buy OpenStack and no cloud

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:06,329
seconds no schoolin fixes OpenStack but

00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:09,689
and have a lot of people made a lot of

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:11,879
money out of OpenStack but I I kind of

00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:13,589
wonder how many of that convert how much

00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,250
of that as a ratio compares graphs that

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:19,199
converts down into the end users

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,329
actually getting as much return on their

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,399
investment as you do from cloud stack

00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:30,870
and there's I think a number of reasons

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,790
for that cloud stack it does what it

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,449
says on the tin is knows maybe not a

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,149
sexy is a thing to talk about it's a

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:40,410
nice platform it and it does what it

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,449
says on the tin that's what we try and

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,310
do we've actually at times had

00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,589
conversations I remember main lists

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:48,329
where we've said yeah but that's really

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,970
not what a nice platform should do

00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:53,930
that's not really a scope someone says

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,269
sugary and then reinvent a tariff or

00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:58,829
inside cloud stack know that's bet made

00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:01,410
cloud stack be able to work with

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:03,000
terraform and let those guys do what

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,009
they do best and we'll stick to doing

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,160
what we do best now it's not as sexy but

00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:14,600
I think over time phase paid off I'm

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,689
making no false promises I would say

00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,089
fairly I don't like hyperbole hyperbole

00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:21,779
and and I actually think in some ways a

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,250
foe

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:27,029
it's a bit of a tortoise and hare thing

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,829
that because there's no marketing I

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,050
haven't managed to get hold of deer this

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:35,339
great big shiny poster for CloudStack

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:37,019
does half of which it doesn't it means

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,629
that when someone's come to evaluate

00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,490
CloudStack they've come to you know you

00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,920
guys they've come to the mailing lists

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,199
there they've gone out and valuated it

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,449
themselves so when they come to decide

00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,220
if they're gonna use it when they do use

00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:54,620
it they actually get what they were

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,279
expecting and so while it's been a

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,709
disadvantage in a lot of ways not

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:02,639
getting any kind of marks than going

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:04,680
around flowers that it has given us the

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,259
kind of well at least it does what it

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,970
says because you go on a mailing list if

00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:12,209
you get Andrea answering your question

00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:19,439
you really are gonna get nothing but the

00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:22,350
cold hard truth the proven longevity as

00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:24,029
saying people are here and you'll hear

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,319
later about what's going on going

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:31,350
forward so it's alive and kicking in

00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:34,589
senses of the work and the passionate

00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:37,379
community again it's this Apache Kahn's

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:41,759
20th year and I'll come back to to stuff

00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:44,250
around that brilliant in a minute but if

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,129
you say I love this this hashtag clouds

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:53,180
that works and now we even have a

00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:56,069
certificate to prove it this is not a

00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,769
training this is not a rent a quadrant

00:16:56,069 --> 00:17:01,649
thing where you pay someone to tell you

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:05,779
exactly what money to feed your better

00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,779
everyone else than everyone else's eye

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,350
patch of foundation didn't know but

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:16,199
usually we're doing this pulp and but

00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:21,059
we've gotten award for best business

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:23,819
tool I think later Irish say yet 10000

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:27,360
professional users of stuff of software

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,700
and services people who so if you've

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,850
doing a cloud thing what should you use

00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,350
what's the best tool for that and

00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,880
they're also giving a load of criteria

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,870
to mark and

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,150
see where it ended up and I think the

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,610
willingness to recommend brands and

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:46,680
colleagues is obviously a huge thing

00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,780
because if people and I think it goes

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:52,470
hand-in-hand with also trustworthiness

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,420
again if you've come to the remaining

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,190
list with we love a said it will be a

00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,560
technical guy just telling you this is

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,320
what it does does this really well so so

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,510
that you know one do that but these bits

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,370
explain and then people go down that

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:13,430
path and know it's going to do what they

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:17,700
think and really all these basically

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:23,130
generation is a Jesus users born 1995

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:25,170
and later so people were just using this

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,340
stuff real professionals have said this

00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:31,470
is a thing that really works for us

00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,720
which again so there must be a lot more

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:38,480
people using clouds that we realize

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:44,910
there has to be to make a dent in this

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:48,150
and as I said that's what the passionate

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,710
community that that's us here and after

00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:52,110
you will be putting the videos up on

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,140
YouTube so hi to the people watching on

00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,230
YouTube it's you as well if the people

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,650
on the mailing lists as the people

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,330
running user groups is probably not the

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,670
guy who was looking for funny pictures

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,390
of cats who then found Rohit and then

00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:13,860
ended up on patchy web site is probably

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,570
not him but for everyone else this is

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,970
the community this is the people who

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,830
have come here and couldn't make it but

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,520
we'll be at some other user group around

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:25,140
the world

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:31,650
there are tens of user groups a lot of

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:35,520
countries are really surprising but this

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:38,580
house that works obviously I'm standing

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,060
up here and as VP it's kind of my job to

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,250
say that in some ways but looking the

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:49,500
other way I wouldn't taking the job if I

00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:51,450
didn't think it actually did so whatever

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,150
I've asked some other people to come and

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:56,760
talk to you until you rot vague and some

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,370
of the names may surprise use some major

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,170
lighting and I've got a lovely makes

00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,260
you've got private cloud we've got

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,180
public cloud and they all have their own

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:11,580
twist on what the services are they use

00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:15,330
and what they do for people one thing I

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,720
do suggest is will do quietly to find

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,340
them probably maybe in a bar later ply

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,270
them with alcohol then ask them

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,370
questions but also suits they also be be

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:27,660
respectful of the fact that they had to

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,310
get stuff through their marketing

00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,880
departments in the first place to even

00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:35,430
speak stuff up here if they are a little

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,950
cagey on answering questions about how

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:41,040
big how much exactly what process do you

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,840
use at what wattage be respectful of the

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,100
fact that there were limited to what

00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,650
they were allowed to say and they've

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,130
done a huge favor by by coming in

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,920
stinking so just you know don't start a

00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:58,170
fight over why they won't tell you which

00:20:51,920 --> 00:21:00,410
generation the process so the first one

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,530
who found out I didn't really know cher

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,220
wouldn't come in the end so sent a

00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,720
quotation for us

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,620
Michigan's been passed by their

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,890
marketing for the benefit of these

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,320
microphones stuff I will read it out at

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,780
BT we use a patchy cloud stack to

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,480
underpin our cloud computer service we

00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,450
have Glo compute zones in 16 countries

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,960
which support key services for many of

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:30,660
our global customers Klaus that gives us

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,210
full range of functionality we require

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:37,280
from an IIST platform while still being

00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,960
easy deploy scalable flexible and robust

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,060
we would like to thank the Apache cloud

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,920
stack community for the continued

00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,960
development of this great technology and

00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,060
we ourselves will continue to contribute

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:57,060
so yeah I know that some of the features

00:21:51,060 --> 00:22:02,790
that are in cloud that come from the BT

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:05,760
British Telecom they've been a car

00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:09,420
around the edges of the the project for

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,890
a long time in fact but it's great

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:16,440
feeling they've kind of completely

00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:20,270
embraced the open-source idea and

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,270
actually more about that in a moment

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:35,799
so next so next up is my first guest

00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:38,360
oh no line of sight line of sight car so

00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,370
the send me some words to explain about

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,179
LeaseWeb or jefra makes his way

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:46,880
it's Global hybrid cloud with HQ in

00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:49,040
Amsterdam the Netherlands Jeffery's

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,929
worked for lease web for 13 years and

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,350
for three years as seeing a systems

00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:55,850
engineer on the cloud stack team this is

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:57,740
his first time at a cloud that

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,110
conference and his first time in Vegas

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,660
and they hope he could they can have him

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,340
back although there isn't note about a

00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,070
deployment of his coat that's going on

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:12,440
and it doesn't go well maybe shouldn't

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:14,840
bother he's in with way from Netherlands

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,520
also and colleague Tyler who's actually

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:26,780
based out here and so I hand over to

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:28,610
different working for a global Global

00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,980
hybrid hosting company where we offer

00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,750
different surfaces from cloud hosting

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,210
the dedicated servers colocation web

00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,760
hosting we've been running cloud stack

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,850
in our organization since 2012 I think

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,620
we started in February 2012 and we use

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:45,340
the product for our VPS hosting and

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,299
public lots and we also offer the

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,950
graphic tiles where we give customers

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,650
our resource pool so that they can build

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,760
their infrastructure on top of there's

00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:56,630
just a little topper in our

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,250
infrastructure yeah we like it

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,620
tops like very much because it's highly

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:03,830
customizable for us way is one of our

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:07,700
one of the BMC from cloud stack I work

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:09,440
for us from us for us right yeah so we

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,000
can customize a lot in cloud stack make

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,710
a lot of changes that are beneficial for

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,120
us and then also country it is to the

00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:19,280
community yeah so we private provide the

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,370
infrastructure that for tech savvy

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,100
customers and they build all kinds of

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,860
platforms of products on our customer

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,950
form and we really like the Apache

00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,300
adopts the community like Paul already

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,930
mentioned there's over a hundred 20

00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,990
active committers of which one

00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:40,270
is away my colleague and we really like

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:43,510
the community that comforted where you

00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,760
can discuss features between us work

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,830
well together we worked with Shay blue

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,250
as well also primitives exporters

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:53,080
together and we really like the

00:24:51,250 --> 00:25:05,430
community and of course this conference

00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:05,430
here to share our ideas next off

00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:14,670
don't fly swatter

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:19,840
needle the quickly dry I googled from

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:23,730
ticketmasters own site first twenty

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:28,270
twenty twenty thousand global clients

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:30,429
425 million events every year so five

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:33,179
hundred million tickets sold annually

00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:37,210
through that through Ticketmaster and

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:39,820
six point five thousand worldwide

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:44,230
employees in 29 countries so

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:46,600
Ticketmaster is no small thing so please

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:57,580
welcome to our stage visual swath spawn

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:59,679
swashb you do alright so I'm going to

00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,290
talk about our journey to cloud stack

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,200
how we got to adopt clouds back in what

00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:08,230
her starting point was so a ticket

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,610
master the untrim cloud is basically

00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,550
almost in a development and production

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,370
environments of all the ticketing

00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,620
products we develop internally so for

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,740
instance when you it won over ticketing

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,309
platform ticketmaster.com or whatever

00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,280
behind the scene you're eating one of

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:28,720
many micro services which are running

00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:33,190
typically virtualized or containerized

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:36,730
on our own from clout and that goes back

00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:40,440
to about a decade it was built around

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:43,300
2009 with XenServer pools

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,240
XenServer pools are orchestrated by a

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:48,310
homegrown portal so developers can who

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,960
in that website and basically

00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:56,050
the VM that's that's what they get and

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,620
it grew to a decent size I want to say

00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:01,330
yeah a decent size in 2017 we were

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,770
counting over and under exam server

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:07,720
pools around 900 exams River host for a

00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,360
total of eighteen thousand virtual

00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,330
machines so something of a decent scale

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,250
that when you want to bring change to is

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:20,590
not easy necessarily and we try to

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,930
modernize that because we realize at

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,940
some point we built this thing before

00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:27,970
the OpenStack and clouds back

00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,180
let me knew so five years ago we gave a

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:34,060
try at OpenStack so it's really the

00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:37,120
quote you said after after OpenStack you

00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:39,490
fried clouds back because we try to

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,090
integrate OpenStack side-by-side with

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:46,030
the existing cloud and that was very

00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:47,770
difficult in the the complexity adarand

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:52,470
added to the environment became a real

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:55,390
concern so we we gave up on the project

00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:59,680
so our cloud stack journey really begins

00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:02,590
late 2017 where we couldn't push further

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:07,480
I mean we had to modernize one way or

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:09,490
another you know we couldn't just like

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,590
build a new data center in an asker

00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,750
developer to create an accomplice a new

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,080
environment of their application so we

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:20,290
had to provide a way for them to migrate

00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,770
in the least disruptive way so what we

00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,900
did is we created a cloud stack

00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,910
extension we created an API endpoint

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,090
within cloud stack that would migrate

00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:35,950
their VM for them so a developer would

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:38,800
ask move this VM this O's name the API

00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:41,530
would look at what the VM looks like on

00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:44,950
the exam side create a new VM on the

00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:46,720
clouds back side under KDM and preserve

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,870
the network identity that was the big

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,420
deal for us is people self-serve but

00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,460
your new VM is just a KVM VM with the

00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:58,060
same most name same IP so that's how we

00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:00,250
got to migrate over 15,000 virtual

00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,169
machines not doing it herself because

00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,720
the the cloud team at that

00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:07,299
I was only four people so four people

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,700
doing design implementation and support

00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:12,070
of the existing cloud in the new cloud

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,559
and we couldn't migrate all those

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:19,210
virtual machines ourselves so that's how

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,879
we managed to do it a year later the

00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:26,830
exam based platform custom platform is

00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:29,350
dead and we went through you see if I

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,330
forget something yeah and we also went

00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,039
through a major upgrade so that was one

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,559
of the thing we found that I mean

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,619
upgrading cloud stack is easier than in

00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,929
an open stack based deployment so we

00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:46,629
were successful at performing def major

00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:48,489
upgrade yeah so in general we can say

00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:52,149
we're across tech adoption went very

00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:53,950
well because it was simple enough to

00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:58,149
understand like the EHA model the

00:29:53,950 --> 00:30:00,399
control plane is nothing mysterious it

00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:03,070
was extensible enough that we could

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,429
create our own API endpoints to do fancy

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,230
stuff like custom migration so the

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,999
migrations are over I mean that code is

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,100
not gonna be used anymore but we

00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:17,200
wouldn't have been successful without an

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:18,519
easy button for them to use and now for

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,539
us it's time for expansion we're

00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:26,649
building new cloud stack environments

00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:29,200
and we rely oh yeah so we take the

00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:30,730
opportunity to make some changes for

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,909
instance storage we started the adoption

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,559
of managed storage if you haven't looked

00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,139
at that I mean that's a very interesting

00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:40,690
feature that I think deserves more

00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:42,879
attention if you haven't touched managed

00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,489
storage if you're familiar with VMware

00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:48,789
well managed storage is a bit like V

00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:51,879
vaults so if you are in need like us to

00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:54,009
have good I of isolation between your

00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:58,029
VMs then managed storage is probably

00:30:54,009 --> 00:31:03,070
something worth a look at autumn change

00:30:58,029 --> 00:31:06,789
we're we're doing were on boarding were

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:09,999
close that we would not have earlier and

00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:12,190
I think it's kubernetes because we've

00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:16,740
run communities for two years on bare

00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:19,360
metal and we learn from that that

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,100
virtualization still have its place it's

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,929
not an all-or-nothing thing that

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,269
virtualization in containers works

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:28,120
together simply because people size

00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:31,360
their containers just like the size VM

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,179
way too large and also our communities

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,830
group they need they need way more

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,950
environments then we can give them

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,889
servers so for us now it makes it makes

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:46,289
a lot of sense to onboard communities on

00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:50,309
the out stack as a first-class citizen

00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:52,690
we're also writing some core components

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:57,070
with the help of her friends from cloud

00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:59,500
UPS so and we plan to contribute them

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,720
back I think we're there generic enough

00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,809
that they can be used outside of

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Ticketmaster the Ticketmaster context we

00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:12,639
were writing basically a network service

00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:14,590
provider for external DHCP and DNS so we

00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:17,350
have to use such thing at Ticketmaster

00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,929
the point is you don't need to have a VR

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,399
if you have this kind of integration it

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,049
doesn't replace like the whole Software

00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,240
Defined Networking it's just a the

00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:28,059
security context we operate is such that

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,879
we need physical networks

00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:34,289
so we're but actually that is already

00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:36,250
news so we plan to contribute it back

00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:38,549
the other thing we're working on right

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:42,159
now is an alternate way to do user data

00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:44,259
so if you don't have a VR and you want

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,970
to do user data today you basically have

00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:48,730
to the config drive options I don't

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,990
think there's a another way right now so

00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,070
we're working on a way to do that

00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:55,179
through the network using open V switch

00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,809
so that would basically be an

00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:01,179
alternative to use reattach to config

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:07,049
drive that would be what we call the OVS

00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:07,049
user data proxy that's about

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:17,320
[Applause]

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:23,050
cool I have one last guest name and

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:24,880
company maybe supposed to yeah I get too

00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:28,030
excited about the company is also great

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,580
to recognize that Anthony is a great guy

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,560
in his own right as he hails from

00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,810
Northampton which is only 20 miles away

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,290
from my hometown just saying there's

00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:41,830
also a special special something special

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:43,300
about that area as we were chatting last

00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:45,490
night I think our Christmases would

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:49,870
probably spend about 25 miles from each

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:53,020
other even though he currently lives do

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,840
you live around QT no somewhere so

00:33:53,020 --> 00:34:00,990
please I should say hey Siri please can

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,990
you welcome to the stage satiny Shalini

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,330
everyone and I promise not do a song and

00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,590
dance but if you ask me remind me of

00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:17,050
when I think something that might tell a

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:19,659
joke well yes I work Apple and if you

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,360
think about the most recent 40 revenues

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:25,060
in Apple and look at service revenue

00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:28,899
it's it's approaching something like 12

00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:30,940
billion dollars of Porter and if you

00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:33,100
work that out against fortune 500 that

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,310
may example services division Apple

00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:39,250
Services Group basically at number 35 in

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:43,210
4,500 so approximately just behind the

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,130
Cisco just in itself so of course the

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:48,760
vast majority of that revenues generated

00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:52,360
by Internet services and I have to tell

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,159
you that of course you're all crystal

00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,320
clear aware that that takes a large set

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,860
of data center infrastructure and cloud

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,860
enablement

00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:06,150
well of course right in the middle of

00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:07,829
Acts is a very large cloud site a

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,480
platform that we running for more than

00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,180
six years when I say six years I think

00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,069
it was 2013 we got into production and

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,740
so we were doing the engineering work

00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:18,210
and putting together development on

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,880
production environments in the year or

00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:25,650
two back so within the contact name for

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,630
very long time now what do we do well I

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:30,420
manage a cloud engineering team that

00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:34,260
basically engineers apples a virtual

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:36,140
machine service and that's grown over

00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,309
the years

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,930
there's plenty things used on your phone

00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:42,599
and stuff you run into when you go into

00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,339
the Apple retail stores that run on our

00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,530
cloud lots of mission-critical

00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:49,430
internal and external applications of

00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:52,470
one sort of the other anytime a attend

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:53,670
application team wants virtual

00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:58,829
infrastructure that come through our

00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:01,470
Council along the way of the examples

00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:04,700
have been a little bit low profile but

00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:07,740
we have been part of the community

00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:10,650
there's another couple of individuals in

00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:12,420
my engineering team that struggled you

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,849
have to say to contribute directly but

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,520
we have to go directly contributed

00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:20,190
patches and some feature enhancements

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,930
over the last few years but we do have a

00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:24,150
good strategic partnership with shape

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,040
blue and through that arrange what we

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:28,859
managed to drive a lot of feature and

00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,910
function into the project yeah well

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:35,700
after Sorensen's here he he's basically

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,140
our lead cloud engineer on the path back

00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,420
side we'd be doing a couple of technical

00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,849
presentations today and tomorrow so

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,180
yeoman team up talk it through see what

00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,180
we're up to

00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,589
there's a lot of exciting stuff going on

00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:54,240
yeah I feel I'd like to wind up and plan

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,740
care the Apache foundation committee

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,000
brought knives in the whole conferences

00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,670
it's like to be a load of fun over the

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,859
next few days and also founder Paul over

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:05,040
here in his mates for setting up the CAF

00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:06,990
a collaboration conference it's of

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,099
exciting bunch of presentations I'm

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,930
looking forward to seeing the whole

00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:16,690
thing so then

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:19,990
oh yeah you want to go mrs. Jones Oh

00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:22,329
last night we were in the the center-cut

00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:25,000
state restaurants right before their

00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:28,089
trip you by the reach go get safe and

00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:31,720
the wage comes up and says you know what

00:37:28,089 --> 00:37:34,119
we've got buffalo t-bone steak on

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,740
special on the menu so Marcus of course

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,390
he pops up and says but my

00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,119
saturdaymostly between a buffalo and a

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,680
bison and I say well it's people in the

00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:56,109
obvious you get a hot and a cold for

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:57,339
bison thank you very much all right

00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,970
thinking them actually just two names

00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:02,349
the same thing what buffalo no bison it

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,500
just depends whether European or

00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:11,230
American as to what you call something

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:14,589
that actually isn't funny but yeah how

00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:18,250
cool was that one thing to take though

00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:20,470
and he said they're hiring they were

00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:26,380
looking for experienced guys to go in

00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:28,859
there I saw was clouded up yeah so you

00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:32,109
got new people facing that I saw

00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:34,650
mentioned store all new people I know

00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:37,240
ena had someone pop-up on the main list

00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:41,049
months or so go saying hey I are new I'm

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,549
joining for five seconds I put my shape

00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:44,529
new hat and say I know we're hiring

00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:46,000
we're looking for we move for Java

00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:49,480
developers who live anywhere in the

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,849
world you wanna work on plastic well pal

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,299
stack is growing it is intriguing

00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:58,180
it isn't even standing still we're all

00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,309
trying you know moving forward fighting

00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,170
over developers it's that that's the

00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:04,779
place were in at the moment trying to

00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,670
foul step forward and find enough people

00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:11,920
to do what the things we great things we

00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:15,789
want plows that to do so I will finish

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,440
up not too long with a little about the

00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,819
Apache way because that's kind of why

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,880
we're in this particular building with

00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:26,490
the Apache foundation there

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,380
a lot actually the Apache foundation

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,880
within itself is looking with and saying

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,549
what does the Apache way actually mean

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,180
and also how do we educate people what

00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:36,220
that means

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,440
especially given they can't quite decide

00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,880
what that means themselves because 20

00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,099
years ago someone wrote some stuff down

00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,279
and now 20 years later it's kind of a

00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:46,990
whole new you know board there is fairly

00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:50,069
unrecognizable from what started so

00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:53,920
everyone has a new idea of what it means

00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:57,069
but there may be is providing software

00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,369
for the public good but there's a lot

00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:02,200
about the Apache way that's what Patti's

00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:06,460
trying to do what's the way is trying to

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,400
do it and I would kind of shorten it and

00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:14,319
say basically your patrons trying be

00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:16,029
excellent to each other and that's kind

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,430
of how I usually interpret a lot of

00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:20,230
people have their own you know

00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,549
commercial reasons for supporting

00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:24,460
CloudStack there's something they're

00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:27,160
trying to do with cloud stack but that

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,329
doesn't make it a zero-sum game but at

00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,029
least over here we have quote from

00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:34,480
British Telecom BT they're trying to do

00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:38,500
different things and it's easy for

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,960
Klepper for one to put in a feature and

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,839
as long as it doesn't try and harm the

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,740
other company using it what you know

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,200
everyone wins

00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,970
how's that as a new feature net least

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,309
wave may use something people in these

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,119
team and use that least we're put in but

00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:56,769
they're trying to do different things

00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:59,650
it's not a zero-sum game and that's

00:40:56,769 --> 00:41:02,289
really the kind of idea that I'd like to

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:06,150
get across about how working in a

00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:09,039
community really is trying to work

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,930
they've got on the apache website or

00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:14,829
some explanations of some of the terms

00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:17,230
they use mobile over us I expect

00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:21,839
everyone did doing the same as me going

00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:25,329
well that just must mean not trying to

00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:29,829
slag off OpenStack for instance and he

00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:32,829
doesn't and I did have to look it up it

00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:35,410
actually means just because you've got

00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:37,539
approval of cloud stack it doesn't

00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,290
matter how much meeting or LeaseWeb

00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:40,750
music

00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:43,480
it won't diminish what's available to

00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,560
the other so it's actually internally

00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,750
how just you consuming it by what one

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,820
user doesn't stop another one is the I

00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:53,820
guess your I Oh separation if you like

00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,340
but otherwise it's just all about Kyle

00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:04,840
working nicely with people and then not

00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:06,760
being a zero-sum game is ultimately what

00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:08,380
a lot of this boils down to and then

00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,640
there's some protection before for

00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,350
people actually contributing that well

00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,110
you're not tired that if you write some

00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,700
code you are absolutely be bound to

00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,490
maintaining for the rest of your life

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,590
you can continue and walk away and let

00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:28,330
someone else look after it if that's

00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:29,710
what's going to do and again well just

00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,720
because it's an open-source license

00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,570
doesn't even good enough for the Apache

00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:40,660
foundation you have to be doing things

00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:43,300
the right way if you like yeah okay

00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:45,850
I think a flack even in its self curing

00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:49,080
cancer it's not helping old ladies

00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:52,000
across the road it's not doing

00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,920
necessarily directly good work for

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,520
people but you do have to remember that

00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,710
the University of Sao Paulo all their

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,880
stuff runs on cloud stack that's how all

00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,590
their students get their services it's

00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,470
the fan hatha society in Germany that

00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:10,030
does again a Research Institute their

00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:15,670
research is doing all sorts of things

00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:20,100
for good of mankind ene and Oprah yes

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:21,940
you know their organizations are calling

00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,890
organizations but they're supporting

00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:28,270
schools they're helping schools deliver

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:30,460
more for the children you know you quite

00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:34,450
easily get into well these people are

00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:36,610
still doing good things the public

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,740
providers you know charities run on

00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:41,020
public providers and probably get

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,590
cheaper rate from those public providers

00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:46,720
all running on a cloud stack and you

00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,730
have to remember even the couple

00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,430
organizations for the public good

00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:53,499
I'm sure people's Apple phones make a

00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:57,339
lot of people

00:43:53,499 --> 00:44:00,700
and it helps and also from the direct if

00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:02,950
we make doing something in cloud stack

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,569
easier it's making the lives of the

00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,210
people who having to operate cloud stack

00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:09,730
easier even if you do something simple

00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:12,999
as rearrange the UI so it's quicker to

00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,680
get from A to B somewhere though when

00:44:12,999 --> 00:44:17,019
when it comes to it some guys gonna go

00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,690
oh they did that because you're driving

00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:22,269
me mad their life has been made just a

00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:25,349
little bit better and if you can keep

00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:27,940
putting smiles on people's faces then

00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:32,680
you know you're doing an okay job you're

00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:36,789
doing something to brass tacks what does

00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,880
it actually really mean so a patchy way

00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:42,220
is everyone is equal all have an equal

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:46,720
voice everyone can have an opinion and

00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:48,339
voice it open communications you've got

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,130
the mailing lists everyone can see what

00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:53,950
been said and what is being said and you

00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,960
can follow those threads and it's clear

00:44:53,950 --> 00:45:00,970
what's going on what conversations

00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:03,519
people are having and the consensus

00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:05,559
we've learned we will make sure you know

00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:07,029
people are on board with things you put

00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:13,599
it out there I've got this idea what you

00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:17,230
think and the community overcoat I think

00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,690
that the basic idea is as someone

00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:21,009
explained to me is you can have a buggy

00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:24,519
release everyone can have a button

00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:27,400
release so the code could be poor so if

00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:30,039
you like that definition but if you have

00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,680
a healthy community if people then go up

00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:37,779
nothing to do here and they all pitch in

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:39,849
fix it then you're back on track if even

00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,589
the best you know the best off in the

00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:44,559
world has a some bugs in it but the

00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:46,329
community goes yeah well someone else

00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:50,349
will deal with that it won't get better

00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:53,920
and it it will it will determine you we

00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:56,140
will become a vicious cycle so that

00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,210
that's how I see that community

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:03,029
overtones about you know everyone

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:03,029
pitching in here to ping someone and say

00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,790
hey guys can you can you check this out

00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,880
for me and someone review my pool

00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:12,980
request there's so many helping out on

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,110
that commenting on all requests having a

00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:18,110
look going oh well I like this but that

00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:20,150
if it makes it something better than is

00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:25,460
constructive then it helps it makes

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:26,960
things better but you know we have to

00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,850
still work on it we have to still try

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,370
and get better each day after nudge

00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:33,080
people we want to see all you know we've

00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,820
got new people coming in on clouds that

00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,770
we want to see them in the mailing lists

00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,970
and see them contributing and engaging

00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:43,400
in conversations I think some people go

00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,320
well I'm maybe new and don't know so

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,440
much I come from this background not

00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:52,580
that background I mean hey if you come

00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:54,650
from a background of something and then

00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,780
there's a problem that is we're trying

00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:59,210
to work out and clouds that the way you

00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,250
did it in your previous background might

00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,760
be the way we need to do it now and so

00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:08,210
you can shout out so well indirectly we

00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,820
solved the problem of distributed some

00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:13,310
things by doing it this way and maybe

00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:15,800
that won't be the way we go maybe all

00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:18,470
just put a light bulb above someone's

00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:20,750
head of some idea but just just

00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:23,330
contribute be involved and that's what

00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:30,320
keeps the community spirit and the

00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:34,970
community going and being vibrant so

00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:37,370
yeah as we we've got this far by being

00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:40,040
indie and what need make to make sure

00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:42,260
that people coming in fill that sense of

00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,660
community and feel like they can

00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,730
contribute and they're welcome new

00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:50,600
people coming on mailing lists be

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:52,970
friendly be engaged answer questions who

00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:58,130
knows what that might lead to in the

00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:59,990
future so we are nearly at the end of me

00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:03,770
talking at you will be pleased to know

00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:06,620
so the reminders are to enjoy yourselves

00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:09,440
the schedule is online so you can check

00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:11,990
out who's where we have the hackathon on

00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,790
Wednesday which probably be slightly

00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:15,440
freeform to start off with and then

00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,620
we'll try and work out and talk about

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,050
what

00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:22,230
Apache con in general is running Monday

00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:23,580
to Thursday so you may want to pop in to

00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,140
some of the stuff that's going on in

00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:29,340
other rooms and other things

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:32,880
no you want to think I'll how would we

00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:36,030
do something clouds that on the HTTP

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,030
side we'll go go into the HTTP talks and

00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:40,950
map someone if they've got a hackathon

00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:43,440
don't grab one of them pull them into

00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:45,590
the cloud stack hackathon and get them

00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:51,720
to explain something how we can get more

00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:54,620
more data through that kind of thing the

00:48:51,720 --> 00:49:00,620
next things up at ten o'clock we have

00:48:54,620 --> 00:49:04,680
mobile UI for clouds back in here and

00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:07,020
did you favor cash for cash you know are

00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:11,610
you doing that one so Geoffrey will be

00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:15,300
doing a customized UI or customized

00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:22,100
cloud stacks in roughly two which is

00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:23,280
next door and I should add the thanks of

00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,390
myself

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,480
Anna cloud stack conference delegates to

00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:33,570
the Apache foundation for getting this

00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,380
going for the Apache con planners group

00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:39,510
who worked out all the logistics

00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,390
obviously the clouds that collaboration

00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,830
conference planners who worked out who

00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:48,630
was going to be talking in which room

00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:51,240
what makes sense that to Maurice and be

00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:55,470
teeth of their quotes to Jeffrey and

00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,730
LeaseWeb for coming sleeping and telling

00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:59,610
us about what they're up to

00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:02,520
to John Force wire and Ticketmaster as

00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:03,390
well and I'll see Anthony and Apple for

00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,480
speaking here

00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:10,380
and I've got one little prop here for to

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,680
say I also have to say to you guys very

00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,680
much

00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:19,290
