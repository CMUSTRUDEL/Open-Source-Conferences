all right so I'm standing between a

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,020
roomful of developers and an urn full of

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,269
coffee so I will endeavor to stay on

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:15,599
time here so hello everyone my name is

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,199
Fred and I work for IBM at the Center

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,960
for open-source data and AI technologies

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,119
prior to that I worked for IBM at the

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,519
same place with a different name the

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,599
SPARC technology center and before that

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,550
I worked for IBM Research for nine years

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,370
now the Center for open source data and

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,860
AI technologies is a open source lab

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,760
located in the IBM Watson West building

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,920
in downtown San Francisco we work on the

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,300
foundational open source technologies

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,039
that underlie broadly the enterprise AI

00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,090
ecosystem and in particular IBM's

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,579
products and services in that area and

00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,829
one key number to point out is here we

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,430
have 36 open source developers in our

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,809
organization working full-time on

00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:07,310
building open source contributing to

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,330
open source evangelizing open source and

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,670
actually we're looking to increase that

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,640
number but already by the way talk to me

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,979
if you're interested already that's

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,360
already a lot of open source developers

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:28,950
I mean 36 people or is it well if you

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,290
look across all of IBM and in particular

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,320
if you look at IBM errs who are active

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,290
contributors to open source projects and

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,630
you define that as IBM errs who in 2018

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,850
have contributed code gotten code

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,340
checked in to an open source project on

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,220
github you can see that our 36

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,119
developers are actually a small slice of

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,000
a very large pie and that whole pie

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,850
itself is actually a small slice of an

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,070
even larger pie within IBM we have a

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,229
program for certifying and training our

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,479
developers who are going to be active

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,630
consumers of open-source in the products

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,770
and services that they build and in 2018

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,320
over 62,000 IBM errs certified to be

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:17,200
like active users of open source

00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:19,360
so you can see that IBM is really big in

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,230
open-source we have a huge presence and

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,490
yet that fact is something of a if you

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:30,670
will open secret now why is that well

00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:35,050
it's mostly because IBM builds

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:40,120
open-source for the enterprise not that

00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:43,000
one not that one not not really any of

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,440
these ones actually but you know the

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,270
enterprise right it's one of those terms

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,730
that in the software industry you hear

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,670
bandied about quite a bit but no one

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,650
ever really bothers to sit down and

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:02,170
explain what exactly is the enterprise

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,690
so in the interest of clarity I'm going

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,420
to put forth a definition which I hope

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,710
that you will find useful and memorable

00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:16,390
an enterprise is an organization with an

00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:18,100
oddly specific mission for its size so

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,780
this is best illustrated with an example

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,670
let's say that you're undertaking a

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:25,840
major enterprise like building the Space

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:28,720
Shuttle enterprise for that task to

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,780
exceed you're going to need help of an

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,410
enterprise like NASA the National

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:37,630
Aeronautics and Space Administration a

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,300
17,000 person government agency with the

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,320
oddly specific mission of managing

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,360
projects that involve sorry need to see

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,910
that involved launching large objects

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,180
into space balanced atop a pillar of

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,920
flame and if NASA needs to provide that

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,050
pillar of flame they're going to turn to

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,810
another Enterprise like Aerojet

00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,400
Rocketdyne formally Rocketdyne

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,280
manufacturer of the space shuttle main

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,080
engine Rocketdyne is a 5,000 person

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,750
corporation with the oddly specific

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,780
mission of building motors that burn

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:15,670
thousands of gallons of fuel every

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:17,799
second and once those large objects make

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,870
their way into space they're going to

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:23,380
beam down many terabytes and terabytes

00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,090
of data and to manage and analyze that

00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,520
data you're going to need a whole host

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,750
of other enterprise

00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,390
enterprises like on the earth a

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,820
20-person startup until they were

00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,500
acquired last year with the oddly

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,660
specific mission of managing and

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,210
integrating the data that comes from

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:43,060
satellites and aerial imagery with other

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,520
data that's of a terrestrial origin now

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,210
in 2015 there was a major drought in the

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,220
western United States and Omni earth

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,230
worked with local water boards to

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,360
identify different parcels of land that

00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,130
were good category

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,470
candidates excuse me good candidates for

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,570
water saving they did this by looking at

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,940
satellite imagery automatically to

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,370
classify different parcels and to do

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,990
this classification task they needed to

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,120
use machine learning and for that

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,030
machine learning they turned to Watson

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,070
visual recognition now Watson visual

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,840
recognition is a service on the IBM

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,360
cloud that provides an image recognition

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,780
capability where customers can go in and

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,760
quickly annotate classify and basically

00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,330
create deep learning based models for

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,440
doing common image recognition tasks

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,350
another thing that Watson visual

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,750
recognition is is built on a whole lot

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:39,360
of open source lots and lots of open

00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:42,160
source in there so so to summarize here

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,640
enterprises come in all shapes and sizes

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,230
they can be big they can be small they

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,640
can be corporations they can be

00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,770
government agencies that can be

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,320
nonprofits but the one thing that

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:57,400
enterprises all have in common is that

00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,250
oddly specific focus on a mission now

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,890
IBM builds products and services for

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,200
enterprise enterprises things like

00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,600
Watson visual recognition and all of

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,380
these solutions particularly in the AI

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,420
space rely heavily on open source and as

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,520
part of consuming that open source we

00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,260
also produce open source we also give

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,940
back heavily to these open source

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:23,800
communities so I've talked to you about

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,190
three of the things that I want to cover

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,670
today IBM and open source and the

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,650
enterprise

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,720
I'd like to squeeze in and the time that

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,150
we have remaining the fourth one

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,890
AI because that's what I work on on a

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,320
daily basis that's what our 36

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:41,750
developers are working on all the time

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,940
so and to talk about that I think it's

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,880
important to talk about what is unique

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,000
about AI in the enterprise in particular

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,960
and those unique requirements they stem

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,580
from well they stem from that focus that

00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,360
I talked about that focus on an oddly

00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,090
specific mission and that focus gives

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,930
rise to two unique enter requirements

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:09,260
for enterprise AI that I like to call

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:16,130
consume ability and scale let's talk

00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:17,900
first about consume ability this is

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,740
something of an IBM term but I think

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,900
it's a very apt term here so the story

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,210
here is enterprises with that that

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,000
focused on their mission they need to

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,790
use a lot of tools to achieve that goal

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,430
and if they have to build if they have

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,650
to produce all of those tools it will

00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,540
diffuse that focus they won't be able to

00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,540
get to the goal so every enterprise

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,430
really needs to be able to consume a lot

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,250
of the tools that they use to achieve

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,060
their mission and for that that happened

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:52,070
the tools need to be consumable here's a

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,810
good a good example of this is the

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,840
telephone right

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,240
pretty much every Enterprise uses the

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,760
telephone I know within IBM we have a

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,710
telephone in every single office we use

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:07,790
the telephone all the time to meet our

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,050
own goals and yet iBM is not a phone

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,950
company now if we want to make AI as

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,650
consumable as the telephone as

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,110
ubiquitous in the enterprise as the

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:22,370
telephone we need to get it to that same

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:26,180
level of ease of use so that a company

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:30,020
or an organization can use AI without

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,330
having to be an AI company now a lot of

00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,180
what IBM is doing in terms of consume

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,860
ability is happening out in the open and

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,830
I'm going to give a shout out here to

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,719
several interesting examples but this is

00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,060
of course not the whole gamut of what

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,490
iBM is doing in these consume ability of

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,490
a spy AI space just three different

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,140
examples first off there's the IBM code

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,580
model asset exchange what

00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,580
you can actually see demonstrated at the

00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,100
IBM table back there this is a part of

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,710
the IBM code site

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,750
developer daivam com where we have put

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,750
together a collection of best-of-breed

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,300
deep learning open-source completely

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,430
free models and we've taken them and

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:12,260
carefully vetted all the IP and we've

00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,030
wrapped them up in a consistent format

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,670
so that they're quickly and easily

00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,990
deployable with a very similar API and

00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,910
basically an enterprise application

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:22,700
developer can get up and running with

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,070
any of these models in about 30 seconds

00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,370
and basically be serving results in 30

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:30,170
seconds and an enterprise data scientist

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,350
can take the models that we've made

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,050
trainable and can in minutes be training

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,140
a custom model using the open-source

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:40,430
fabric for deep learning and speaking of

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,980
the fabric for deep learning

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,810
that's another IBM open source project

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:48,560
that we're happy to have released just

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:51,740
this year of fiddle as we like to call

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,620
it is a system that allows

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,090
administrators of large systems working

00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,360
in the enterprise to quickly and easily

00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:01,220
deploy state-of-the-art tools for doing

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,960
distributed training and end-to-end

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,620
lifecycle management of deep learning

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:09,920
models fiddle is also the open source

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,380
core of IBM the IBM clouds Watson

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,020
machine learning deep learning training

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,840
service and we also use fiddle very

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:20,090
heavily within IBM research for training

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,150
novel kinds of models and speaking of

00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,130
IBM research another piece of open

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,380
source technology aimed at that consume

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,690
ability need that's come out of IBM

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,780
research is Apache system ml which used

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:35,870
to be an IBM research asset system ml is

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,760
aimed at allowing researchers and

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,830
machine learning developers to quickly

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,230
and easily prototype novel kinds of

00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,720
machine learning algorithms system ml

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,620
provides a high-level language to make

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,240
algorithm development easy and

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,100
sophisticated optimizing compiler that

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,230
turns algorithms written in that

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,920
language into a very efficient and

00:10:54,230 --> 00:11:00,680
highly scalable execution plans and

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,710
speaking of scalability well let's let's

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,290
speak about scalability for the moment

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,019
enterprises in their

00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:12,370
just march towards that oddly specific

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:14,259
mission often will deploy economies of

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,600
scale and when we're talking about

00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:18,639
artificial intelligence these economies

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,370
of scale can be in terms of people

00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,500
having a large team of data scientists

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,899
all working on the same problem they can

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,790
be in terms of data leveraging massive

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,980
amounts of data to train better models

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,790
or they can be in terms of leveraging

00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:37,810
hundreds of racks of compute all focused

00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,310
at the same on the specific problem for

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,670
all of these different kinds of scale

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,500
IBM has been releasing open-source

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,149
technology that we use in our own

00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,160
products and services to help enable

00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,160
this scale with our own enterprise

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,230
clients one of these is Jupiter

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,300
enterprise gateway this is technology

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,730
that we developed internally to meet a

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,910
need that we had in terms of scaling our

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,279
clients data science teams one of the

00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,959
important barriers to getting a large

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,149
data science team working effectively

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,910
together is the need of all the data

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:12,220
scientists to be able to run interactive

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,610
notebook environments on top of a large

00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:17,139
shared infrastructure and to maintain

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,329
the security and the integrity of that

00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,250
infrastructure at the same time what

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:24,339
jupiter enterprise gateway does is it

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,829
allows many data scientists to run

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,019
Jupiter kernels remotely on a shared

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:31,329
cluster while still maintaining the

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,730
enterprise of grade levels of security

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,860
and authentication we use Jupiter

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,750
Enterprise Gately gateway heavily within

00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,209
multiple different IBM products and

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,550
services and also since it's become

00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:44,980
open-source it has just recently become

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,139
a top-level Jupiter project so we're

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:52,449
very proud to have that been announced a

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:54,220
couple weeks ago now jupiter enterprise

00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:56,410
gateway as I said is used widely within

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,959
many different IBM products and services

00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,870
and it is especially important for those

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,600
services that embed Apache spark which

00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:06,970
brings me to Apache spark another area

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,670
another open source project where IBM is

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:12,370
both a major consumer and a major

00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,740
producer iBM has closed out over a

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,139
thousand jiriz within apache spark we've

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,670
contributed about 60,000 lines of code

00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,850
we currently have four

00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,030
on the project iBM is really big into

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,890
Apache spark we have a long list of

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,500
products and services that use spark and

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:32,290
it's really it's the go-to solution

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,450
within IBM and really across a lot of

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,940
enterprises for when you need to churn

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,100
through a huge amount of data analyze

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,280
that data and then train a large-scale

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:44,200
machine learning model and one you want

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,030
to deploy that model into production

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,530
well then there's Apache Open whisk a

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:54,370
large code base that IBM recently

00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:57,370
donated to the Apache Incubator which

00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,400
provides a server list framework Apache

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,800
Open whisk allows users to take

00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,960
functions or complex functions like

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,660
machine learning models and quickly and

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:11,410
easily deploy them and make them run it

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,510
basically arbitrary scale and without

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,280
having to worry about what server each

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:18,100
of these functions is running on this is

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,810
a very powerful technology makes it

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,940
makes things that used to be very hard

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,980
to do in machine learning very easy to

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,900
do makes it easy to manage complex

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,240
machine learning workflows in production

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,920
we actually have a demo of this running

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,290
at the IBM booth I'd encourage you to

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,000
stop by if you'd like to learn more but

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:36,010
basically Open whisk is a really

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,020
exciting new technology to come out of

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:41,050
IBM and that we're happy to donate to

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,460
the open-source community now you'll

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,530
notice by the way this is the third

00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,120
Apache project that I've mentioned and

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,730
that's not a coincidence

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,640
even within my own small slice of the

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,390
pie we have committers on six different

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,190
Apache projects and more broadly iBM has

00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,460
a long and very positive relationship

00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:03,220
with the Apache Software Foundation we

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,410
in addition to supporting a passion

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,300
financially we've contributed hundreds

00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,420
and thousands hundreds of thousands of

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,430
lines of code to ASF we employ dozens

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,670
and dozens of Apache committers we

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:19,120
employ many PMC members we employ one

00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:21,460
ASF president apache is really important

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,400
to the way that IBM does open-source and

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:27,010
so I'm really honored to be able to

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,590
speak today at the Apache con conference

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,930
so thank you very much for spending the

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,560
last 15 minutes with me I hope that

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,860
you've learned some

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,390
interesting about enterprise AI I'll be

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,400
at the IBM booth for the rest of the day

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,320
if you'd like to talk some more but

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,300
thank you so much and let's get some

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,200
coffee

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,070
[Applause]

00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,119
