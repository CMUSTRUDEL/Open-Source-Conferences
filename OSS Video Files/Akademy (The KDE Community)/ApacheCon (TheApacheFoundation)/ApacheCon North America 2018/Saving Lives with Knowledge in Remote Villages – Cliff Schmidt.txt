okay all right thanks a lot rich that

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:10,769
was a very nice introduction so it is

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,389
really great to be back at Apache Con

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,890
and also to see how many people are here

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:19,109
for the first year that's awesome so my

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,740
first Apache con was 15 years ago not

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:25,230
quite 20 years ago the first one and and

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,260
that was in Las Vegas and I've been to

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,560
to every Apache Con in the US and Europe

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,170
for several years until something

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,739
changed in my plans and so that's what

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:46,079
I'm gonna talk about now all right so I

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:49,370
I was on the incubator PMC I was on the

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,660
board of directors and then I think

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,129
sander here was the one who had this

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,320
idea that maybe there should be a vice

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,579
president of legal affairs and me not

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,120
being a lawyer ended up in that position

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,530
so so that was actually the one of the

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,489
main ways that I was involved in Apache

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:11,700
back about 15 years ago 12 13 15 years

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:16,229
ago so then one day I was giving a talk

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,080
in Atlanta and and I decided to just

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:23,909
walk around the city and I walked right

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:27,270
up to this and so this is the grave of

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,460
Martin Luther King jr. and I just kind

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:36,030
of stumbled upon it and this was March

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:40,560
1st of 2006 and I I suddenly felt really

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:44,070
small really tiny and I felt like he

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,399
wouldn't be as proud of me and what I

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,799
was doing with my life as as he could be

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,149
and and so I was kind of thinking about

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,939
the things I was doing life and felt

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,549
like there's something something bigger

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,180
so it was really kind of this experience

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,979
that that woke me up a bit it didn't

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,259
change me as a person I was still you

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:08,160
know same person but just got very

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,660
focused and so this this grave is in

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,520
this nice reflecting pool here and

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,380
there's a

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,730
around it with the statue of Gandhi and

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,800
quotes from Gandhi and from dr. King and

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,210
and one of the quotes there's a lot of

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,870
great stuff there but one of the quotes

00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,240
that got me was this one so life's most

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,570
persistent and urgent question is what

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,950
are you doing for others and so I

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,360
thought about that a bit and I felt like

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,360
I was doing some things for others I

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,980
think I think everyone here at Apache is

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,100
doing things that's benefiting a lot of

00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,410
others but for me it it made me feel

00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:52,310
like there was something more I needed

00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:53,990
to explore so I spent the next six six

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,610
months or so just kind of thinking

00:02:53,990 --> 00:03:00,830
what's important to me what of all the

00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,840
issues in the world what what really

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,350
mattered to me what what felt like the

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:11,840
greatest injustice in the world and and

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:13,670
so I thought about monopoly and now

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,220
here's the thing about monopoly is it a

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,040
monopoly a lot of people know about this

00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,290
game you start with a certain amount of

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,530
cash everybody starts with the same

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,380
amount of cash now can you imagine if we

00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:31,010
tonight we ended up playing Monopoly and

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,720
and you sat down to play we're actually

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,260
there you sat down to play with a few of

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,770
us and and we gave you five dollars but

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,330
everyone else got 500 and we said okay

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,820
let's go let's see who wins

00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,440
let everybody's got a good shot right we

00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,260
wouldn't play that game we'd say wait a

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,150
minute that that doesn't make sense why

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,790
would we do that but that's what we do

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,830
on this earth that's what we do when

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,100
people are born into a part of the world

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:02,360
with far far far fewer resources than

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,640
than many of the rest of us and and so

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,370
you know coming from Apache and thinking

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:13,480
about meritocracy that idea of of equity

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,640
of getting equal access to resources

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,730
it's so so so far out of balance that

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,200
for me it was the thing that I felt like

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,850
I've got to be part of changing

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:27,050
something with this situation

00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,410
so so I wrote an email to Apache which I

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,730
found

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:32,990
tonight and and said hey sorry I'm

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,070
turning over my vice prison of legal

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,780
affairs work to Sam Ruby and I'll be

00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,910
travelling without internets and so a

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,880
few people said what what's going on no

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:45,500
internet that's that's pretty strange so

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,970
then I had to do a follow-up email that

00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,650
said okay you know a couple of people

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,750
have asked I'm off to a remote region of

00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,970
Ghana to study health education and

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,590
microcredit to address rural poverty I

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,590
don't wanna bore anyone but that's

00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:00,200
basically the thing so now I'm going to

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:03,980
explain this a little bit more so so

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,870
yeah so this was July of 2007 so here's

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:10,070
what I did I I went out to Ghana and

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,510
rich gave me this nice introduction to

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,220
stay I went to Ghana to change the world

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:16,040
but I was definitely much more about I

00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,420
went to Ghana and Ghana changed me I was

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,480
able to understand the world a little

00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,240
bit more so I went there out to this

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,100
remote rural part of Ghana so Ghana's in

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,810
West Africa and and you could go to

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,310
dozens and dozens of countries and if

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,840
you go to the right place in those

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:37,580
countries out to the more remote rural

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:40,730
areas you'll see some similar a lot of

00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:44,360
similarities so here's an example of

00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:45,919
people sitting under the big tree that's

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,260
that's typically going to be around

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,910
rural village along the side of the road

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,830
and they're there and they're very

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,800
interested in something and what what it

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:57,110
is is that a group of people with

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,330
information about health came to talk to

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,580
them and so now these people are all

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,470
farmers and they it was during the

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,419
growing season but it was so important

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,970
they actually left their farm to learn

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,810
about how they could take care of their

00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,890
children's health so for instance

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:16,880
[Music]

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:19,850
malaria in in Ghana is a huge killer of

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,880
children and pregnant women in fact in a

00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,870
lot of these countries if you have a

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,250
child there's about between a 10 and 20

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,800
percent chance that one of your children

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:33,710
is going to die by the time they reach

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,780
age five and so this is the reality

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,610
people are living with and and so if

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,910
someone has some information about how

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,520
you can you can prevent your child from

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,620
dying there

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,580
they're pretty interested so now the

00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:51,599
problem is people will say well one of

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:54,360
the great ways of avoiding malaria is to

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,610
use bed nets but there's a few important

00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,400
things about that if you drop bed nets

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,440
into a village people have to know how

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,780
to use them and why to use them is it

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,509
really important so for instance this

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,180
example here this this gentleman needs

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,360
to understand that the net needs to be

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,030
tucked around you under the mattress you

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,479
can't have your arm poking out you can't

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,820
you can't have holes in like big holes

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,650
in the bed net or the mosquitoes will go

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,070
right through it should be treated with

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,009
insecticide it shouldn't be leaning on

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,870
your skin so there's all these pieces of

00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,449
information about how to use a bed net

00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,659
and the fact that the most important use

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,250
of a bed net is is not for your crops

00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:41,310
it's not as a fishing net it's not as

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,889
many other things but but why not why is

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,430
it really important and so if people can

00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,849
hear opinion leaders in their own

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,460
communities talk about the importance of

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:56,220
this this kind of thing then that can

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,870
convince them to say maybe maybe this is

00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,520
important maybe this actually can make

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,930
the difference between whether my child

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,870
lives or dies so so that's that was some

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:10,289
of what I learned when I went out there

00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:11,820
back in 2007 so what I'll do is just

00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,949
going to give you a quick overview I'm

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,500
going to show you about a two-minute

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,750
video there was a news crew that came in

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,900
we won this award a few years back and

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,750
in the prize was basically a really

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:28,650
really heavy thing I had to carry back

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,789
from Doha but more importantly a video

00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,710
and so I'm just going to show you a

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,430
quick little video that some documentary

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,430
crew did about

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:44,000
a rural area in the Upper West region of

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,100
Ghana where most of the people are

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,680
farmers under educated and without

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,350
access to electricity or mobile networks

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,660
the talking book is an affordable audio

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:57,050
computer it's a major source of

00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,709
information the talking book is one of

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,300
the most robust devices that

00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:03,860
technological interventions as bit

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,680
grease from the world in the past few

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,779
years it's a multimedia application that

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,020
helps make relevant knowledge in African

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:15,020
health available to people the leaf in

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,959
rural places people the last hard to

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,570
reach people in rural places behind the

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,880
audio book program is the NGO literacy

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,580
bridge which partners organizations like

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,980
UNICEF care and meter to generate

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,990
messages on agriculture and health the

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,029
information is created in the form of

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,820
drama song or an interview and

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:36,800
transferred into the talking book the

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,990
gadget is powered by batteries and they

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,570
are circulated between the communities

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,180
and literacy bridges offices where they

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:49,209
are charged users navigate simple audio

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,209
menus in any language and then listen

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:59,360
quickly through the talking book we've

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:05,709
learned where to access fertilizer and

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,709
how to apply it to our crops and I'd be

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:16,820
also on our farm animals used to die

00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:23,020
prematurely we know not how to care for

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:25,730
them any baby

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,649
the talking book is the only source of

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,750
information on modern methods of

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:35,120
Agriculture and health care in these

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:38,690
remote communities the talking booster

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,529
just so many things it's in all a much

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:46,670
particular about the cholera that's come

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:49,620
in Ghana this year let's do two

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,440
dystopian books we have learnt a

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,010
and we have made sure that the measures

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,400
that we have put in place we are safe

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,740
from this collar talking book allows its

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,520
users to record feedback by a single

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,980
click on the button with use of feedback

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,839
statistics we have talking book is

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,460
designed in such a way that people can

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,529
record a message through that user

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,720
feedback letting us know what they are

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,970
actually benefiting from in the talking

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,160
book and we can make the talking book

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,680
available to every family and to extend

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,160
the program does a whole upper West the

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,000
holder rapper or even the whole of gana

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:33,920
Oregon

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:38,730
[Music]

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,680
okay so now you might have noticed that

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,420
they referred to the organization's

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,580
literacy bridge so that was the name

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,230
that we started with we just changed it

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,750
to Amplio and last year part of the

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,130
reason is because when Rich mentioned

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,870
you know things that I've learned along

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,650
the way and that has changed what we

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,420
were doing well it was my idea to invent

00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,339
some sort of piece of technology that

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,040
could be useful for children and

00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:03,810
classrooms so so we had and most of the

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,820
classrooms actually much more crowded

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,320
than this you're kind of seeing a little

00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,510
sub classroom here it's usually about

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,080
eighty to a hundred kids in a class with

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,120
one teacher and so I had this idea of a

00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,339
really low cost audio technology that

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,310
would allow children to hear messages

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,080
are here books being read by their own

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,060
teacher and it would allow the teacher

00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,360
to kind of be in lots of places at once

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,790
in a way so that was the idea but when I

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,770
went out into these communities and I

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,020
met with with everyone I could to

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,640
understand issues of poverty it was the

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,050
people who were in health and who were

00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,050
in agriculture who said wait a minute

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,700
I'm not a technology person but let me

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,260
understand you're saying you you want to

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,680
create this audio device that could be

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,380
very easy for people to use even in

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,610
villages without electricity and they

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,130
don't need to be able to read and they

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:54,480
could use it in play audio and you want

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,220
to do this in schools so that sounds

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,500
nice but let me tell you what I would do

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,020
is if I had something like that I would

00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,920
record everything I know that I try to

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,029
teach people about farming you know

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,920
or the health people would say

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:07,899
everything I know that are important for

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,760
parents to know about taking care of

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,990
their kids health and I put that on that

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,790
device and I would leave it in a village

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,500
because the problem is I can only get

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:17,800
there maybe every couple years two or

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,839
three years and when I get there I've

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,089
got all this knowledge to share but the

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,889
people there are in most of these

00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,630
villages are illiterate and so they

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,000
can't take notes so can you imagine

00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,389
you're a farmer and someone says okay so

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,709
you farm for different crops well let me

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:34,420
give you all this information about

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,730
preparing your land and planting the

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,070
seeds and how far apart should your

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,709
seeds be what month should you make sure

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,720
you plant by how do you harvest and and

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:45,970
weed and fertile and how do you make

00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,250
fertilizer and store it and negotiate

00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,930
with a middleman and the value chain all

00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,269
this kind of stuff and someone saying

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,699
what what okay I think I got that part

00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:58,120
you're coming back in three years that

00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:00,310
that would drive me crazy so what they

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,660
said was if I could take all that

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,970
knowledge and put it on a device like

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,120
this that's what I would do so I said

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:09,480
well we should probably try that too so

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,070
we did both things and we saw a lot of

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:17,320
of great possibility in the schools and

00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,180
but the but what we also saw was some

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,230
pretty exciting things going on in the

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,190
villages so here's what happened I don't

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,540
know if you've ever heard this phrase

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:31,240
that IQ is evenly distributed around the

00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,130
human race and around the world well let

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,589
me give you an example of this here's

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:39,269
what this guy did so this guy his name's

00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,680
Felix when we gave him a talking book

00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:45,190
that was loaded with content on

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,470
agriculture he did an a/b test um this

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,149
guy had never been to school before this

00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,089
was his idea I wish I could claim credit

00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:54,069
for it but he said he said you know what

00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:56,620
let's see if this works I'm going to

00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:58,120
take my corn crop and on half of it I'm

00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,740
just gonna plant the same way I've

00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,810
always planted with the way my parents

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,579
and grandparents taught me and on the

00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:04,240
other half I'll try all these different

00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:07,870
things

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,870
I'll try putting my my chickens and my

00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,610
goats I'll build a pen for them to stay

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,170
in at night because otherwise these farm

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,240
animals are just all over the you know

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:18,279
roads and everywhere but I'll keep them

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,769
in a same pen at night and that will

00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,870
essentially allow them to to poop and

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:24,100
I'll be able to pick it up and it'll be

00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,320
all in one place I'll be able to use

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,139
this to create manure I'll apply it just

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,910
the right way I'll build beds of dirt

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,410
instead of little mounds of dirt

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,880
I'll space it the right way I'll make

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,740
sure I plant it in the right month I'll

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,060
do all these things and let's see if it

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,260
makes a difference and that's the

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,490
difference it made so I took those

00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:45,190
photos and I was blown away and really

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,560
indebted to fell except he he was smart

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,019
enough to try this out this is the kind

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,630
of thing is that if if you can get

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:55,209
resources to people people who are

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,699
otherwise just don't have that

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:01,630
opportunity what great things can they

00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:04,829
do so when we saw these kind of results

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,199
we said well we're a small organization

00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,910
we've got a focus we can't be doing some

00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,320
things in schools and some things with

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,589
connecting people and villages with

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,660
knowledge and so we had to shut down the

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:19,149
school program so that was a tough call

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,310
but but I feel like if you're going to

00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:25,690
do something especially if you're doing

00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:27,220
something like a non-profit why not be

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,690
the best in the world at what you're

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,100
doing and if you're not the best in the

00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,600
world if you can't be the best in the

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,579
world why not support whoever is the

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
best in the world and so I felt like

00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:36,070
there's no way we could be the best in

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,260
the world of two things two very

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,060
different types of things so we dropped

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,890
the school program and focused on on

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,149
this idea so basically what hopefully

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,670
you got from the videos it's about

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:47,740
taking knowledge from local experts in

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,100
the local language recording that in an

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,040
audio form they're often speaking about

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,990
agriculture or health behaviors and then

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,890
our focus is on the most vulnerable

00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,410
communities people where they're just

00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,049
are they've got challenges that we can't

00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:06,610
even imagine and fewer resources than we

00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,540
could imagine trying to deal with it and

00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,089
there are a lot of great organizations

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:13,059
out there helping a lot of people who

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,799
are in need but our focus is really the

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,299
ones that are the hardest to reach are

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,410
the ones that are often getting

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,569
overlooked because it's it's not easy to

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:25,089
to find ways around these challenges of

00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,110
no electricity and illiteracy and remote

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:29,350
areas and extra

00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,059
poverty so people take these devices and

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,670
they listen to them and they talk about

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,920
these messages together when they're

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,420
farming they're they're taking it out on

00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,330
their farms and listening to it together

00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,570
and that's basically the idea so now I

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,309
just will tell you a little bit about

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,080
the technology I figured that you might

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:51,820
be interested in what are the the main

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,380
pieces how's it work so so here's here's

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,250
the device now I'm gonna have a few of

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,299
these on the the Apache table so if

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,299
you're interested in looking at it later

00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,600
or if you see me around at the reception

00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,730
tonight

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,380
I'll probably have one of these on me

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,240
and I'm happy to show you but basically

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,220
this is the idea so you've seen the top

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,150
right it it just runs off batteries

00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,220
because in a lot of villages you don't

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,750
have electricity we have a model now

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,120
that has rechargeable battery so if

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,880
someone has the ability to like charge a

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,710
cell phone over a solar power charger or

00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,330
something like that you can equally

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,780
charge this just over the same USB

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,179
connection the issue is that a lot of

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,390
the people who are most vulnerable in

00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:38,169
the world don't own their own phone it's

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:40,030
changing but the access and I mean it's

00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:43,059
been changing for 11 years that I've

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:45,100
been doing this but but there are no

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,340
smart phones at all where where we work

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,740
and the then there often are some of

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,150
these small like flip phones but the

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,070
people who have typically been

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:56,650
disenfranchised the most especially

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,360
women are not the ones that own these

00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,799
phones so this is one of the reasons why

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,429
we could I could tell you more about

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,929
some of the issues with phones but so it

00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:07,690
just runs with batteries you can easily

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:12,240
use the small double-a batteries or a

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:15,549
large D either will fit but not both and

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:22,750
and it basically just speaks to you in

00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:23,679
in your language so okay so maybe it'll

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,860
be helpful if I give you an English

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,000
version so that's that's one version

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,850
that's used but here's a demonstration

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,450
come to the talking book press the right

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,000
hand to choose a subject help to learn

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,590
about health press the tree to try

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,379
another subject

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,899
the right-hand farming she'll learn

00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,580
about farming livestock she'll learn

00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:48,249
about my know you get the idea lots of

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,690
different categories of information and

00:19:48,249 --> 00:20:02,889
then enough you go to health for

00:19:49,690 --> 00:20:05,049
instance I have four children of which

00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:08,700
is raised with exclusive breastfeeding

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:11,710
for six months after birth up a

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,259
sister-in-laws and daughters who equally

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,779
have children my advice to them has

00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:18,610
always been to practice exclusive

00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:22,570
breastfeeding fosters well so this is

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:24,749
just one example the issue is that I

00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,700
don't know how many of you are parents

00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:30,789
okay good all right me too so when I

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:34,419
became a new parent I didn't know that I

00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:36,039
shouldn't feed my daughter food on when

00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:37,779
she was born I mean I eat food why

00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:43,210
shouldn't she food when she was a month

00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:45,309
old and or water even so especially if

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,499
you're out in a remote village where the

00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:49,450
water and the food are aren't aren't

00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:52,149
going are going to be contaminated and

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:55,499
small little babies can die from things

00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:57,129
like that that's why they emphasize

00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:58,570
breastfeeding there's not a lot of

00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:01,389
formula out there in these remote

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,950
villages but the thing is that that

00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:04,869
doesn't make any sense to someone who's

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,899
like what do you mean not feed water to

00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:10,210
my baby you want me to starve my baby

00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,850
that's crazy and so you need to have

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,669
these opinion leaders who can who can

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,429
speak authoritative lis to people who

00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:23,049
they can connect with and also you want

00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:26,740
to use the the kind of ways that people

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:29,730
talk to each other in dramas or in song

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,730
so here's a song

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,359
[Music]

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,100
so this was a locally recorded song

00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,250
using a wooden xylophone because that's

00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,130
what people used in that particular area

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,780
and and it's talking about why it's so

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,280
important to use bed nets so that's

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,870
that's kind of the approaches it's not

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,880
just the technology but it's getting the

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,500
right content on that that works for

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,210
people now one of the key things is

00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,300
you'll see it's got a microphone for

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:01,820
user feedback that was one of those

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,330
things that I think I wasn't expecting

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:07,850
how important it would be but it's one

00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,980
thing to get messages to remote villages

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:14,240
so that they can learn all these new

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:16,130
ideas but it's just as important if not

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,400
more important to listen to them and

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,230
hear not just what they know what works

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,420
for them what they've tried but also

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,120
what they need or what they don't need

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,850
and so we partner with organizations

00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,030
like UNICEF and in government health

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,610
ministries the World Health Organization

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,710
and a lot of times they are pretty sure

00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:39,980
they know what people need but they're

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:41,840
often wrong and and so we go out there

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,390
and we try to check to make sure that

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,520
we've got the right messages but when we

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,170
hear people giving feedback you know

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,230
often it's it's really nice feedback

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,910
it's saying hey I've tried this and and

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,820
suddenly I'm growing more food and all

00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,980
this is great but sometimes they say you

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,710
know you told me we shouldn't marry our

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,790
daughters off when they're 14 years old

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,910
okay that's that sounds good we actually

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,140
in our villages we learned that a few

00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,120
years ago even though it was a

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,860
traditional practice we no longer want

00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,010
our daughters to be married off when

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,410
they're 14 or 15 but yet it still

00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,450
happens do you want to know why well

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,150
lately these days we've got this problem

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,310
of teen pregnancy and so yeah when they

00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,900
get pregnant then sometimes they want to

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,490
get married or sometimes we think that's

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,900
the best thing if you really want to get

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,890
to the root of the problem let's talk

00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,360
about teen pregnancy

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,210
now that's something we weren't even

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:35,540
thinking about and so this idea of

00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,490
listening to people to direct even big

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,470
organizations great organizations like

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:43,870
UNICEF to focus in the right area is

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:46,010
important so I'll just show you a rich

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,200
brought up this device which I didn't

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,460
know he had from long ago this

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,380
looks a little bit different from this

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,669
one so let me tell you about that so

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,460
this is what this was the first version

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:57,649
and you notice it's got these arrows on

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,320
it here's a problem that I learned was

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:05,510
for a while you know people would what

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,850
this what this is saying is I'm gonna

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,230
press the right hand to listen to

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,970
different topics well

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,320
when the message was going really long

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,080
in some of these languages I was like

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,720
why is it taking so long to say the

00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,669
right arrow and what I learned was

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,350
there's no word for arrow and a lot of

00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:23,360
these languages there's a bow and arrow

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,580
but not like a directional arrow like

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,789
you'd have on a map or something and so

00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,370
what people in trying to be helpful they

00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:32,690
were saying there are four points that

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,760
look kind of similar on this device

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,830
press the one on the right that's a

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,409
really long way to get to you know press

00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,659
the right to something so so we did an

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:43,309
icon study we had all kinds of icons

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,929
that represented different things that

00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:46,340
we saw I'd take photos of different

00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:48,649
things and villages I'd send it off to a

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,799
designer who would do a little icon

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:53,210
representation and then we would do

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,269
studies and see how fast people could

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,639
identify them if I said where's the tree

00:24:56,269 --> 00:25:00,080
they point to something and it wouldn't

00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:01,820
be me would be the translator saying

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,980
that and then we'd see what how fast

00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,269
they point to it and then from that we

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,760
ended up coming up with what were the

00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:10,159
most successful icons but then how does

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,080
it look on the device collecting these

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,039
different icons what do people like best

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,899
and so we would do a little user focus

00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:20,419
groups and say which one which one is

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:22,220
most pleasant to you and so that was one

00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:25,880
of the things we learned and it's very

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,260
different being in the US and you know

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,600
thinking you know what might be right

00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,220
and it worked pretty well

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,159
but it's another thing to go in and to

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:38,269
do some really detailed studies so we

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,279
went from this to to this so the last

00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:42,679
thing I'll say about technology is is

00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:45,919
monitoring the data as another thing

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:47,929
we've done a lot of lately so we know

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,460
exactly whenever someone pushes a button

00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,110
now we don't get to see it immediately

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,450
because there's no network in these

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,529
places but it's logged on the device and

00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:00,930
when someone connects a Android phone so

00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:02,310
most people don't have smartphones that

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:04,380
no one has a smartphone in these

00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,940
villages but when someone who is

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,790
visiting one of these communities

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,300
regularly they bring an Android phone

00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:16,380
with an app that was developed by a

00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,880
volunteer from Apache actually what they

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,040
can do is they can plug that into this

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,080
device it updates it with new fresh

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,120
content and it grabs all the usage

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,640
statistics and those user feedback

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,420
messages that were on there and uploads

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,100
it to our our servers and then we have

00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,020
these graphs and lots of different

00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,430
dashboards stuff to show what are people

00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:38,520
listening to what are they talking about

00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,510
what's the what are the the most popular

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,460
messages

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,830
what villages are least engaged and that

00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,900
that of course is super important if

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:49,050
you're serious about making sure people

00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:51,300
are involved in your project so last

00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:54,750
couple things I'll just say is is how to

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,610
grow something like this and how to do

00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,810
it the right way so we want it to be

00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:02,430
narrowly focused on on knowledge we

00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,350
wanted to be the best in the world at

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,510
house can you provide knowledge that we

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,810
all take for granted to people and

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,940
remote communities the issue those if

00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,890
you want to make a impact yeah there's

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,320
this knowledge chain of you know

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,460
knowledge and awareness behavior change

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,680
but there's this other stuff on the

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,120
right that we were not doing how do

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,070
people have the resources where are the

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,260
bednets who's giving them that how about

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,260
any seeds or fertilizer that would be

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,210
useful for the farms how about even a

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,370
buyer to buy their crops

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,320
these are all questions that these

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,660
families were asking us and we were

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,950
saying oh yeah that would be useful we

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,260
should probably figure that out but

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,910
should we do that so we realized we need

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,400
to partner with other organizations to

00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,900
do that so we started partnering with

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,060
organizations like UNICEF and

00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,910
agriculture organizations and we and we

00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,590
say you guys do the part that you do

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,510
well we're going to provide the

00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,860
knowledge that supports that and bring

00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:58,800
these resources and knowledge together

00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,190
so we partnered with organizations like

00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:05,040
Care and UNICEF and Agri and hears about

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,770
how we've been scaling so far so ten

00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,870
years ago when I gave a keynote at

00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:13,770
Apache con the last time I was at Apache

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:15,180
con we were just starting we

00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:19,470
experimented with a few hundred people

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:21,390
so now we reach about 600,000 but we we

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,670
want to go a bit bigger than that and so

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,440
these are the different partners that

00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:28,500
have joined on with us and now we're in

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,680
Ghana and Kenya and Rwanda and Uganda

00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:33,210
and but we're looking at more bigger

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,730
numbers I'm not sure that our

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,130
organization will reach a billion people

00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,290
in the next few years or by 2030

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,970
but the United Nations has these

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,830
sustainable development goals you might

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,190
have heard of and it applies to all

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:51,150
countries but our focus is on these

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,860
issues of poverty and health and in the

00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,730
environment and all of these things that

00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,310
apply to it applies to all of us but how

00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,140
will people who have no formal education

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:02,640
and no access to knowledge how are they

00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,290
going to achieve these so we're

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,500
partnering with some big organizations

00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:09,900
to not just help us do the work we're

00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,880
doing but to help others learn from what

00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,540
we're doing to to reach the poorest

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:17,520
billion people on the planet and so how

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,320
has this changed anything well we've

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,280
done randomized control trials and we've

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:25,170
seen that 50% more mothers are sleeping

00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,650
under bed nets now than in the control

00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:30,840
groups farmers are winning awards in

00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,970
fact the woman on the the right was the

00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,770
best soybean farmer in the entire

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,660
country of Ghana there are 28 million

00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,240
people in Ghana so we were not expecting

00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,280
to get those kind of results but the

00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,220
other farmers were growing 48 percent

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:46,530
more crops where's the ones who are not

00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,510
using a device in the same year had a 5%

00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,100
drop so those are the kind of things

00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,630
that we have to see is it actually

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,300
making a difference and keep looking at

00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,800
that we've actually won a couple awards

00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,370
- I've ended up meeting some interesting

00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,810
people and the process and the the funny

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,510
thing is that like you know when I was

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,760
working in in software purely software I

00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,710
was not no one none of these folks were

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,360
looking forward to meeting me but once I

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:12,510
started doing the thing that I was

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,230
passionate about then it's interesting

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:19,400
who who gets involved so the very last

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:21,900
thing I'll show you is just how it's

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,190
affected some of these women around

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,730
health and so let them speak for

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,450
themselves

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,670

like yellow blue yellow there okay so i

00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,770
could not have done this without a lot

00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,990
of Apache people a bunch of people in

00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:15,720
this room and I mean literally dozens of

00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:19,290
folks from Apache were supporting me

00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,950
very very early on some of it was in

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:25,320
code as I mentioned we we have an app

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:28,710
that was developed by someone who heard

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,340
me speak at the keynote 10 years ago and

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:34,140
also this this audio content manager

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,280
you've got a lot of audio but how do you

00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,440
tag it with all the right information

00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,780
and maintain it and do it in an offline

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,399
environment that sometimes is connected

00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,139
and sometimes not

00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:48,059
so I've had a lot of support from Apache

00:32:43,139 --> 00:32:51,539
folks through through volunteering but

00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:54,960
also even in donations so there's an

00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,940
Apache member bill Roe who's been one of

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,330
the many people who's been supporting

00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,590
donating to this work and he actually

00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,960
told me when he heard Weis coming out

00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:07,289
here that he's putting up a ten thousand

00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,149
dollar challenge grants so if any of you

00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:11,239
are interested in philanthropy and any

00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:14,669
of you find this work important to you

00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:16,879
then if you do decide to donate to this

00:33:14,669 --> 00:33:19,529
organization help make this possible

00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:21,899
bill Roe is going to match that dollar

00:33:19,529 --> 00:33:23,879
for dollar up to the first $10,000 so we

00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:26,399
actually have a Facebook campaign going

00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:28,349
on or if you donate at our website

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,349
that'll be matched and that's through

00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:33,359
this week of Apache con so if you're

00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:34,289
curious to the Facebook you can just

00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,220
type in Amplio

00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:40,169
and you'll see us there and you'll see

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,700
fundraisers and then there's the Apache

00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:45,450
one and we've already got some folks

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,399
started so so anyway thank you very much

00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:51,419
for your time it's really an honor to be

00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,559
back at Apache Con again and and look

00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,480
