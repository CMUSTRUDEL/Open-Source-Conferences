I'm so pleased to be here and I feel

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,260
like sometimes it can be a little

00:00:07,429 --> 00:00:11,639
discouraging to say yeah all of the

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,570
magical things that we think will make

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,540
everything better

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,580
will not but I think that this crowd

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,400
knows I mean your committers and

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,830
creators and you know that the tech in

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,109
and of itself is not going to fix

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,000
everything the community that we build

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:32,940
will as rich mentioned my name is

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,270
Bridget I live in Minneapolis Minnesota

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,579
which most people in the US we say

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:43,680
Minnesota and they assume we're Canadian

00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:46,350
please an access and I work for

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,780
Microsoft more on that later

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:52,739
and I podcast with arrested DevOps

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,360
mostly we've been doing live shows at

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,079
conferences lately but we have a few

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,379
good guest

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,750
scheduled soon and I also am the chief

00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,850
cook and bottle washer for the DevOps

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:09,180
day's organization so this is next year

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,450
will be our tenth year and this 2018 we

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,610
have 71 conferences on six continents so

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,820
if you would like to run one in McMurdo

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,780
Station like definitely talk to us or

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,340
you could get yourself on the wait list

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,450
for the Montreal one which is October

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,580
10th and 11th they they are already sold

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,030
out but you know waitlist sometimes let

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,409
people in okay

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,909
usually I'm talking about cloud and

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:34,950
containers and kubernetes that's not

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,290
what I'm talking about today however I

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,180
feel like a Microsoft paid for my travel

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,590
so I have to tell you we're hiring this

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,729
is what everyone tells you from

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:48,890
conferences right and I will say that

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:51,420
this is what a lot of messaging around

00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,710
you know everything we do in tech and

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,930
like let's talk about the social element

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,430
because that's so much harder and I look

00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,180
at this and I think that is totally a

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,659
lie though like what is actually true is

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,549
that computers are hard and humans are

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,009
hard and then you put them together and

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,310
it's hard like this is not the thing

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,650
this thing we do is not easy and I think

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,840
it's it really diminishes the work

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,810
we do to say something is easy because

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,590
it's not but as we all know when we're

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,579
building complex systems the

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,319
interconnected nature of the complex

00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:30,689
systems and the fact that these systems

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:34,079
have a lot of unanticipated side-effects

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:37,560
means that we will often build systems

00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:40,500
that whether they you know are like AI

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,400
which okay algorithms they're not magic

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,379
but whatever it is will sometimes get

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,090
effects that we weren't looking for that

00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:50,819
we didn't want and so that's what I want

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:55,260
to talk about a little bit today is the

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:57,510
the exponential complexity and like okay

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,900
compact complex socio technical systems

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:03,599
are hard film at 11:00 I I don't know

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,040
about you but I got a CS degree in the

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,889
90s because I didn't want to talk to

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,069
people spoiler alert

00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:14,489
Tech is full of talking to people we we

00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:17,910
all know this in our organizations in

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:21,419
our open source projects the fact that

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:23,370
we have great code is not actually going

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,480
to win every argument especially if we

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,359
approach it as trying to have an

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,919
argument right and it's I think it's

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,440
it's interesting when I look back at I

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,780
still have my my scheme textbook from

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,970
the first CS class I took and I look at

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,370
that picture and I'm like two wizards

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,699
this is awesome and then I think like

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,560
okay

00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,109
the medieval alchemists on that cover

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,780
like they're doing spells with lambda

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:56,310
calculus and you know cutters you know

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,129
but um because Lisp but we also are

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,500
doing what could be considered as the

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,840
closest possible thing to magic now stay

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,329
with me for a second you're shaping

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,150
reality with your words whether you say

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:13,319
them or type them then reality occurs

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,720
based on basically your will like that's

00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:18,479
a weighty responsibility and it also

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,049
means that we have a lot of work to do

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,169
to make sure that the code we write and

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:26,460
the impact that we can have does good

00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,340
things in the world I mean hopefully

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,880
like

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,630
bad things and it is a lot of

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,250
responsibility and I think that in tech

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,080
we do talk about anti-patterns but we

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,010
focus on the technical anti-patterns

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,780
we focus on the anti-patterns that we

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,139
know will have bad results and we may be

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,300
sometimes allied or ignore the social

00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:52,710
anti patterns that we've also noticed do

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,180
not have the best possible results and

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,310
that the solutions to a lot of

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,500
difficulties that can appear like a

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,510
technical discussion a lot of us have

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,700
noticed we might be able to resolve

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,889
those by I don't know talking to other

00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:10,210
humans wait that can't be right but like

00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:12,400
it is right so let's I made a short list

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,169
and I feel like you know making a five

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,880
things list is already reducing things

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,330
too much but I made a short list that

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,270
we'll talk about here of things that I

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,039
think we need to remember the first one

00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,070
being we can't actually solve everything

00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,350
with tech and if that does not seem

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:38,380
obvious to you welcome to tech you must

00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:41,139
be new here and I think that because we

00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:45,030
end up looking at and then projecting

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:49,000
from a lot of technology into the future

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,190
this is from a late 19th century series

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,780
of drawings of what the tech was going

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:56,590
to be like you can see they're having

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,880
video chats but I they can't they can't

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,580
hear that person over the video chat

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,700
it's probably fine but I think about

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,419
like predictions like noted tech

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,889
thought-leader Jane Austen and I'll try

00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,690
to quote this directly it is a truth

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,060
universally acknowledged that a techie

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,220
input in possession of any production

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,930
code whatsoever must be in want of a

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,710
container platform I'm pretty sure

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:23,680
that's the way Jane Austen put it and

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,650
it's again like in tech we very office

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,110
often focus on we will definitely solve

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,870
all these problems you know the dev in

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,330
the ops and whatever this wall of

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,890
confusion that exists will definitely

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,890
solve these problems if we put some

00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,969
containers in there between the dev team

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,319
and the ops team

00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,899
and this picture by the way is

00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,879
definitely wrong I usually remix it to

00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,769
be a little bit more aligned with the

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,589
incentives that are driving these teams

00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:52,719
if your team is rewarded for shipping

00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,809
and someone else's team is rewarded for

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:58,719
stability or vice versa your incentives

00:06:55,809 --> 00:07:00,549
are misaligned and so yeah sure there's

00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:01,779
gonna be conflict that doesn't

00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:03,129
necessarily have anything to do with

00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:05,319
tack per se

00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,489
I mean maybe somebody is yoloing things

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,249
out to production that are a terrible

00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:15,069
idea but that's not necessarily what's

00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:17,099
happening there it's uh basically if you

00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:19,719
have contention inside your organization

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:23,289
about the technical decision making that

00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:24,639
is affecting everyone's lives see groups

00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,419
and namespace those are the least of

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,979
your problem

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,619
what you have you have much bigger

00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,139
problems than that right and this is a

00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:33,989
picture that peach has lack put up and I

00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:37,779
put up the date of that tweeze this is

00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:40,329
2015's this isn't new peach has logged

00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:43,119
put this up at a dev ops days in Austin

00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:46,059
and was using it I think to illustrate

00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:49,149
that okay if we're going to talk about

00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:52,149
silos inside an organization your

00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,769
feature teams and your production

00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:56,139
platform engineers are not the only

00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:57,939
teams like there's lots and lots other

00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:59,319
teams and one team that maybe gets short

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:01,239
shrift or you know as we see in this

00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,639
picture does not have a good time is

00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:05,229
your security team because if people

00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,809
think they can paste on security at the

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,429
end like I have exciting data breaching

00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:14,349
this for them it doesn't usually work

00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:17,139
that way but again the way you're not

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:20,199
having these problems with security

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:22,479
because you had bad tech you probably

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,069
had bad communication through your

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:29,469
organization about when you were gonna

00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:31,509
do that security review and the thing

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,870
that makes me sad is that this tweet of

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:37,149
peach has Lux is from 2015 and people

00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,309
are still shipping heavy weight app

00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:41,289
containers with an entire full unpatched

00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,000
operating system in them so like this is

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,360
this problem even though we know about

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,769
it doesn't necessarily go away okay so

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,139
if you're saying to yourself right now

00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:52,480
oh but at my organization we are DevOps

00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,070
thing right like whatever you think that

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,390
means

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,920
anyone knows what that word means please

00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:02,490
tell me but if you say for your

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,250
containers you're like oh we keep all of

00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,830
our credentials in you know someplace

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,690
secure and the credentials only go in at

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,520
run time and we're running the same

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,040
containers in every environment and it's

00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,050
like maybe maybe you just ship

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,860
lightweight containers with a with

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:24,420
static binaries like okay but are your

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,520
traffic patterns and data very similar

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,360
or the same in every environment like

00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:33,390
kind of the I like the the thing that

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:38,100
goes you should rename staging to theory

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:40,560
as in it works in theory it's like it

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,360
works in staging it worse in theory not

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,820
on production right so this is where

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,730
again like there's a lot of really

00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,520
useful tech things you could be doing

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,560
but there's a lot of people problems

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,450
inside your organization probably and

00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,040
unless you work in an organization not

00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,900
staffed by humans in which case you know

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
I hope your robots all get along really

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,240
well

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,820
but there's problems inside

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,760
organizations where people have their

00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,730
desire to argue about tools or the

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,820
desire to argue about definitions of

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,290
words there's there's a great tweet by

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,700
Andrew clay Shafer that I don't have in

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,110
this deck where he says who wants to

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,950
argue with me about the definition of

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:26,580
made-up words and it's like there's a

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:29,910
lot of conflicts in our organization

00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:31,440
that we can't buy a tool from a vendor I

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,200
work at a vendor we would love to sell

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,030
you tools but they will and services but

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,800
they will not solve the problem of

00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:41,550
getting people inside your organization

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,410
to talk to each other and getting

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,370
information about your systems is is

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,320
non-trivial

00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,000
right again Schafer likes to call the

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,150
state of any running system continuous

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,180
partial failure like that's what we got

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:58,230
so at this point I think it's it's

00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:01,200
pretty typical for people to delineate

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,330
and say this is where we're gonna focus

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,610
and having focus for your organization

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,250
is great say

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,290
that everything worked in our

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,950
development environment it worked on my

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,810
laptop

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:17,550
like really because I want you to the

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,970
vasa if you're not familiar with this

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,630
17th century ship the TLDR on it is

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:27,029
turns out scope creep and lack of

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,980
documentation it's super unhelpful and

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:33,930
can lead to ship sinking on their first

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,730
voyage and that idea of like well we

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,420
designed and you know planned it all

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,010
well that's cool but like cool here's

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,690
our story bro that doesn't actually make

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,440
sure it's going to work in production

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:48,709
and calling that someone else's problem

00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
super unhelpful so again you can have

00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:52,470
basically all the great tech in the

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,149
world isn't gonna solve any of those

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:59,430
problems those are problems we have to

00:11:54,149 --> 00:12:01,950
solve with talking ok I then I want to

00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,870
focus a little bit on the interactions

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,209
between your team so you talked about it

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,149
a little bit on a high level but I would

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,649
say like our distributive systems that

00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,630
we're building today are really complex

00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,839
alright that's a given we know that

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:20,180
they're increasingly complex and we

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:24,630
can't have perfect mental models but

00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:27,300
when we focus just on shipping all right

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,640
like let's just ship something that

00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,190
doesn't necessarily make sure that we've

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:38,730
architected something that we can debug

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:41,459
or you know add anything to the way we

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,699
try to compose our team's is also a

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,160
problem because I have sad news for

00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:52,769
people who think that micro services are

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:56,070
going to prevent their or basically if

00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:58,040
you have decomposed your organization

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:00,420
into a lot of small independent teams

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,100
like your two Pizza teams are gonna

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,880
still need to have conversations over

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,740
that pizza with each other because they

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,620
still are building things that are going

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,930
to interact with each other and also

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,190
like how hungry are these people and how

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,870
large are these pizzas I feel like

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,790
there's a lot of unanswered questions in

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,510
the to pizza team thing but

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:23,380
I think that we're getting a little bit

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,510
I think we're in the trough of

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,250
disillusionment about microservices now

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,920
like people are starting to realize that

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,950
maybe they don't solve absolutely

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,170
everything maybe they don't make say

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,620
troubleshooting as easy as we would like

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,600
it to be and I think it's also it's

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,760
useful and maybe important for us to

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,430
realize that absolutely everything is

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,070
trade-offs an old boss of mine Tim girls

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,350
calls it conservation of complexity well

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:52,390
you're still gonna have it you make the

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,220
mindful decision to move that complexity

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,410
around to somewhere else that doesn't

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,410
make it go away but that's not how any

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,180
of these things work but we've all been

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,980
in those project planning meetings where

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,750
somebody is like and now we get the new

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,350
whatsit and everything becomes easier

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:11,890
like hmm this doesn't sound true because

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,480
it's not all right so basically you're

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,310
going to have complexity somewhere in

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,850
your stack you just have to decide where

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:22,800
you want that to be and again breaking

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:25,180
up the organization into a smaller

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,860
subsets that then have a zillion

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,560
interactions with each other what could

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,690
go wrong there

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,390
it also doesn't solve the problem of all

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:36,550
of those teams need to determine where

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,680
the boundaries of responsibilities lie

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,570
people love to do that by like fate or

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,060
chart because that maps to talk

00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,470
perfectly right like every time you have

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,600
a new microservice you just spin up a

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:51,910
new team this will scale infinitely but

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,430
he Mel Conway wrote this in the 1960s

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,840
and I like to think that he and he's

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,940
still around he's on Twitter which is

00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,330
amazing but I like to think that he's

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,350
basically talking about today like

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,860
except that he wouldn't have called the

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,380
paper

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,760
how do committees invent because that

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:12,070
buries the lead like today it would be a

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:14,620
clickbait listicle but when a lot of

00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,140
people think that Conway's law means

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,360
that your chart needs to look exactly

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:23,140
like your dust our architecture diagram

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,420
and that's not true because the very

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,580
important word that I want to focus on

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,590
here is communication it's not that your

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:32,570
software has to look exactly like your

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,930
team but it is going to look an awful

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,900
like how your team and teams communicate

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:41,990
in interact with each other back to that

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:45,290
pesky people problem the CS profs lied

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,490
to me but uh actually they didn't they

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,260
never promised me that I wouldn't have

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,580
to talk to people I just thought that I

00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,600
would play with computers and it would

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:55,850
be fine but like say you have your

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,740
excitingly deconstructed monolith that

00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,360
is a you know perfect set of micro

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,100
services that you can totally monitor

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,520
and completely understand because that's

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,060
reality like what if you have breaking

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,520
changes and like what if say schema

00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,060
migrations in one part of your datastore

00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,720
like are affecting people somewhere else

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:20,510
and everyone who is selling you you know

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,880
monetarily or idea-wise on some exciting

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,070
new what's it always shows you the hello

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,430
world app and they don't show you the

00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,440
app with you know the legacy data that

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,860
you actually need to migrate without

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,160
corrupting it because that's the hard

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:39,230
reality that we actually live with and I

00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,940
would say like whether whether you're

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,860
looking at Baxter Microsoft or commerce

00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,480
somewhere else like always look for

00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,240
those examples that have a little bit

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,440
more complexity because I mean I assume

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,950
that you're not going to spend any money

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,250
or time by trading your hello world apps

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:59,690
and also like it turns out state matters

00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:02,030
right but yeah so okay so you're not

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,110
going to break into a zillion teams just

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,060
based on your micro services

00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,790
architecture but whatever teams you do

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,890
have probably should be cross-functional

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:13,100
to some extent just so that there are

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:16,700
people who are in the tribe of that team

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:20,690
who can say security it's a thing right

00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:23,240
so and we've seen we've all heard from

00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,980
organizations that say like oh our teams

00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,270
are all independent we only communicate

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,990
through api's it's like okay I mean that

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,610
probably is fine unless say you want to

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,540
launch a new version of the API and

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,100
maybe there's something you want to

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,350
deprecate is that something you're just

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,450
never gonna do like there's there's a

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,430
lot of open questions there like at some

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,130
point you're going to have overlapping

00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:49,520
conflicting needs it's like have a come

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:51,590
station you know bring some pizza all

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,240
right like the next thing I want to

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,890
cover is that again

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,780
and you may notice a theme here these

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,130
are all about the human communication

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,420
stuff Tec is made out of people I mean

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,130
hopefully the pizza is not made of

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,630
Soylent Green if you're having a pizza

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,290
conversation but like the tech actually

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:13,370
is and I think it's really easy for us

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:15,980
to put ourselves into the oh we're

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,290
focused on this project oh we only care

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:20,510
about this stack oh we do this very

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,890
similar thing to other people but we

00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,630
just call it something different so

00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,640
we're way different than they are it's

00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:28,010
like I have news for you like none of us

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,390
are a unique special snowflake and we're

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:32,680
not that different we're a lot more

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,940
alike I assure you that this and

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,710
probably every other conference I've

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,830
been at in the last you know five years

00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:42,020
are full of people that a lot of our

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,520
relatives who work in medicine or

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,920
agriculture or whatever would be like

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,940
you're all the same you know like no we

00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,060
are different in these very specific

00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,400
ways it's like not really I think if we

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,550
focus a lot more on what we're trying to

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,310
accomplish rather than our very specific

00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,870
narrowly defined tribe its hey get

00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,360
together with your tribe talk about

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,920
stuff but just remember the other tribes

00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:09,800
are a lot like you the ones over the

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:11,690
hill just like you and it's a it's a lot

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:17,210
more important to focus on what we're

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:19,610
accomplishing and from an individual

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,280
level I think it can be really tempting

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:25,040
in tech to just focus on getting to work

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,450
on the things that are gonna help you

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,130
with your resume level up and they're

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,260
gonna help you get your next job and are

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,060
gonna help you with your very specific

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,180
goals and I think the problem with

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,890
resume driven development is that it can

00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,840
be very easy to end up with things in

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,540
your stack where you're like what did

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,710
you build you know and then someone has

00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,570
gotten their resume driven development

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,760
level up and someone else is left

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,640
maintaining that and so again this is

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,470
this has to do more with the

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,750
communication between the people then it

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,550
does and like the people's motivations

00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:59,270
than it does the actual tech that's

00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:01,190
being chosen but like whatever

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,590
burning tire fire a give an IT project

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:08,750
creates we can all bet it's gonna burn

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:09,950
for a good long while I think that you

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,780
can we'll take a look at Ward Lee's

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:14,810
pioneer settlers town planners model I

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,030
think that it's it's interesting because

00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,410
I'm definitely team settlers and not

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,820
just because I'm obsessed with Settlers

00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,940
of Catan though yes I am wearing

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,760
Settlers of Catan leggings but I really

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,770
like scaling things up and

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,020
operationalizing them I know that a lot

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:33,170
of the glamour and the glory in tech

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,450
focuses on instantiation and so I kind

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,920
of push back on that I'm like what about

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,870
scaling because that's pretty cool too

00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,400
and I want people to feel motivated if

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:44,930
they're interested in that and working

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,760
on that and also Astrid Adkinson as a

00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,530
director at Google and I think she has

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,880
she's she's been at Google she likes to

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:52,930
say that she's been at Google since it

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:56,570
was a little startup she joined in 2004

00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:59,060
it's grown a bit and I think this is

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,160
this is super true and I actually I had

00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,900
I had retweeted a different version of

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,550
the street and I went and found this 1/2

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,860
screen half last night and was like

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:09,020
would I didn't treat this one so I had

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,250
to and then I think everybody else did

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:16,220
too this morning because it's our impact

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:20,090
on each other is a lot more important

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,550
than winning any specific tech

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,890
discussion or shipping any specific

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,630
software I mean tools can and do help

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:33,890
with all of this but they don't make us

00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:35,930
care ok so I would say like all the talk

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:38,540
of you know by the way all the talk of

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:43,340
building walls no we're not doing that

00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,930
but I think that there is there is like

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,810
that wall of confusion that we had

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,370
earlier it's not really tiny and

00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,900
adorable and you can look over it right

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,470
like it's a lot worse it's a lot more

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:58,430
like sometimes everything seems

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:59,720
overwhelming and I think that that's not

00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,430
what I'm talking about when I say good

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,250
fences make good neighbors I'm talking

00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,920
about the idea of boundary objects and

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,880
conditions we need some kind of

00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,120
definition and constraints to work we

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,559
need

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,870
some kind of information like again

00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:20,750
something like containers can help with

00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:24,440
the metaphorical or ultra real divide

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:26,840
between teams but finding the right

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,410
boundaries for even service boundaries

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,690
is again a human problem that we

00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:36,350
definitely need to talk through like

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,330
it's it's never as unambiguous as like

00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,350
the first round of architecture diagrams

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:45,920
make it makes it look and I think that

00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:48,020
like so if any of you have siblings I

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,260
have four and I think deciding what's

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,780
yours and what's theirs is like the

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,530
basis of every sibling rivalry you know

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:59,360
date on that you have and I think I like

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,570
to think of Eric Brewers cap theorem

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,160
here because as a distributed systems

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,200
expert and co-worker of mine now

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,400
awesomely Katie McCaffrey likes to put

00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:13,100
it you can't actually you can pick one

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,950
you can't pick two because you don't get

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,690
to pick not having partitions like

00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,220
you're going to have partition you just

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,370
have to decide how you're going to deal

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:26,929
with them and you know because physics

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:30,880
and math they exist but because we live

00:23:26,929 --> 00:23:34,850
on a big round planet mostly water and

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,340
people are making decisions while other

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,670
people are sleeping or at conferences or

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,670
on planes or mostly sleeping if you are

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,440
trying to have a distributed team you

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,450
need to distribute the decision-making

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,429
to the edge I can tell you that this

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,110
works with the DevOps tazer organization

00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,150
people are deciding things all the time

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,179
they're I think they're like three going

00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:58,880
on right now there's no way that central

00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:00,710
control can decide everything and get a

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,300
lot of IT organizations still have a

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,100
pretty centralized decision-making

00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,130
process and I would just challenge you

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:12,860
to empower yourself by letting go of as

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:15,200
much as you possibly can and and that

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:18,590
yes that does mean lower bandwidth

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,420
communication but I think that open

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,680
source projects have this settled like

00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:26,090
you understand that

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:29,450
you need TCP TCP based communication not

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:31,340
udp-based like you need sins and acts in

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,290
your conversation where you know how to

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,520
build computers to do that and we can do

00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,250
that in our conversations with each

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:41,090
other too which is to say when you're

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:43,430
making a decision and I know the the

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:47,020
Apache model is great for this like do

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:49,790
we have consensus like and so many

00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,680
corporations do not think that way and

00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,660
they they really need to restate what

00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,300
they heard to check some what they think

00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,710
is gonna happen like that is the way to

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,600
decide things and that means like when

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,840
we're making architectural decisions we

00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,850
we do not make them based on what the

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,850
most glamorous stickers are on the

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,650
adorable laptop and you know is the

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,510
kitten sitting on I feel like there's so

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,250
many decisions that are pretty much made

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,280
by like well the kitten sat on the

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,320
docker sticker so and it's like no the

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,150
laptop is warm all right Occam's razor

00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,100
said this is a much simpler problem to

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,030
solve than you would think

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,990
I think thoughtful decisions about our

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,060
architecture and well-considered

00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,000
constraints can make this sort of thing

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,770
go a lot more smoothly again containers

00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,690
help us with the scope and definition

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,980
but they don't magically solve all those

00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,420
other discussion points and this is a

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,750
when we're saying let's just build

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,730
what's right like I this is the part

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,590
where I tell you I wasn't surprised at

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,080
all by the cabe Cambridge analytical

00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,060
stuff because I worked at a company that

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,800
did very similar things they did in 2014

00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,180
at 2012 2012 to 2014 I was running HBase

00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,190
clusters full of things that people

00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,770
definitely didn't opt in to their

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:11,000
friends giving us from Facebook and I

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:12,680
think like it's a lot we focus on let's

00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,960
just solve this right but we don't

00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,970
necessarily focus on and are we solving

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,360
it in a way that is considering our

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,310
impact on society and yes that is harder

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,830
than getting HBase or MongoDB as you do

00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:30,290
your will but like you probably want to

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:31,910
try because like we hey we now have the

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,380
technology to create the oppressive

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,190
cyberpunk dystopia that we've all been

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,960
reading about

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:41,419
theity like great I think that we do

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,429
need to remember that the people who can

00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:47,090
build the oppressive cyberpunk dystopia

00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:48,769
are us and we shouldn't and all of the

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,330
people who can't build it and you can't

00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:52,639
really stop us from building it

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,340
they aren't NPCs like they're actually

00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:56,269
protagonists of their own narrative too

00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,259
like we have a pretty strong

00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:02,419
responsibility there so that that just

00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,429
brings us to hey it would be great if we

00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:06,529
didn't make the world worse that's a

00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:09,019
pretty low bar right because like we

00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:10,669
know that the world is changing and the

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:13,399
kubernetes project I want to say is like

00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:15,860
four years old and maybe four years ago

00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,169
we didn't recognize that that was going

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,139
to change some things in tech it also

00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:23,090
doesn't mean that hey we've solved tuck

00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,009
now we have we can coober some Nettie's

00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,259
and we've solved everything like no

00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,429
that's not realistic either it's going

00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:30,740
to keep moving it's going to keep

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:33,559
changing we need to keep moving and keep

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:38,570
changing because you know as Deming puts

00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:41,509
it like we we don't have to modernize or

00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:43,580
change or learn something new but if we

00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:48,679
don't we're probably going to be the sad

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:52,039
snowman that March and we have I think

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:56,000
it's really easy for us to figure out

00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:59,419
that we know what works and then not

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,610
change anything past that but let you

00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:08,360
become legacy so fast super fast and

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:10,519
it's I think tech also really likes to

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,590
say that legacy oh that's the bad thing

00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,539
that we're not doing but like I say it's

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,370
also the thing that works and it's also

00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:20,990
where your customers and money live and

00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:23,629
so focusing on making sure that we

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:26,509
aren't leaving it behind super important

00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:28,639
again back to the human factors nobody

00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:30,259
wants to be told they're in sad mode and

00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:32,659
everyone else gets to be an awesome mode

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,509
and move forward like that's no one

00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:37,580
wants that and if you put people in sad

00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:39,590
mode and tell them that you know you're

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,059
not changing or modernizing anything and

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,169
you don't get to learn anything new like

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:45,409
how long do you think they're gonna work

00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:47,990
with you that's not realistic so again

00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:50,390
this is the get people to all pull

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,600
cutter by recognizing they have human

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:56,900
motivations that's there's there's no

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,480
like flowchart or checklist that can do

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,160
this but there is just recognizing and

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,230
understanding that other people have

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:08,809
needs and that they're trying to fulfill

00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:10,130
those needs and I think that this is

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,679
this is my spouse

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,030
we're canoeing in the Boundary Waters

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,559
because dimension Minnesota is right

00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:22,040
next to Canada think about us and I look

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,920
at the that ecosystem and it's complex

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:28,520
and it's changing and there's fire and

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,780
renewal and I think like it sometimes

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,260
feels like we live in the darkest

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,300
timeline but unless the walls of the

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,280
multiverse collapse and re4 themselves

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,830
with say Minnesota being part of Canada

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,960
please same access we live in this

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,800
reality we need to make the best of it

00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:49,309
and I feel super lucky and excited to

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:53,900
work someplace that is motivated to make

00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:56,179
the best of it I work at Microsoft I use

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,160
a Mac and I get people to use Linux like

00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,650
that that's pretty much living the dream

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,050
or we can conclude that this timeline

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:04,670
might not be the original timeline but

00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,700
I'll take it

00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,860
and Microsoft is genuinely focused on

00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,900
open source and making a better world

00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,780
you can come talk with us talk to us at

00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,970
the table go to my colleague grass

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,730
gardener session on balancing

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,290
transparency and secrecy gee the sort of

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,490
thing a lot of us are trying to do in

00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:27,590
our organizations tomorrow and yeah I

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,860
would say to build a future that we

00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:33,770
actually all want to live in we have to

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:42,180
build it together so thanks

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:42,180
