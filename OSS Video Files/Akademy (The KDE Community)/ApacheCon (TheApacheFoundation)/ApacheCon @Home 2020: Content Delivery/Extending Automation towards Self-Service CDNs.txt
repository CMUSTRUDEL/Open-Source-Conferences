Apache Traffic Control is a set of applications designed to complement Apache Traffic Server to comprise a Content Delivery Network. Currently the creation of production-like CDN environments is a complex process. I will be demonstrating how Iâ€™ve been able to augment existing OSS Ansible automation to produce disposable test CDN environments.

Jonathan Gray has been with Comcast on the Content Delivery Network team for approaching 3 years focusing on Operations and Automation. Prior to that he's served as a software developer, integrator, and devops lead for Milsoft Utility Solutions for 7 years. He holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Science from Abilene Christian University where he also served as an IT Systems Administrator, Datacenter Administrator, and Virtualization Administrator for over 3 years.
