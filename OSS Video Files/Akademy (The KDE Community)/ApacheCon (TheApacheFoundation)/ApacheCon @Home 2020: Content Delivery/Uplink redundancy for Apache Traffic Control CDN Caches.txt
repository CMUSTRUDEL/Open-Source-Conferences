	Uplink redundancy for Apache Traffic Control CDN Caches

Apache Traffic Control CDN Caches at Comcast have been configured with a simple LAG with LACP connection to a single uplink router with a single IP. That created maintance costs for the CDN caused by router maintanence, and impacted overall reliability during router outages. To solve these problems an update to ATC now enables configuring connections to multiple uplink routers. Virtual IPs can now be assigned to the cache and advertised to the rest of the network via BGP peering allowing further flexibility with content routing.

Sergey is a Sr Engineer on the CDN team at Comcast.
