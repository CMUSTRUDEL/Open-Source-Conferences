Parent Selection Strategies are an upcoming feature of Apache Traffic Server. We will discuss how they work, and why they're valuable to Apache Traffic Control. We will also preview Parent Selection Strategy Plugins, a feature currently being developed, what they may look like, how a plugin may be written by ATS users and ATC administrators, and the additional benefits Strategy Plugins offer to Apache Traffic Control deployments.
