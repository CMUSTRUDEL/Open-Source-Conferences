Publication date: 2019-09-20
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	The CloudStack UI code has tolerated massive technical debt over the years and the UI codebase has reached a breaking point. In this talk, we will do a comparison of modern UI development techniques, the pros and cons of current UI UX and codebase, ideas and experiments of a new UI for CloudStack. We need to discuss and propose a new UI that:n* Has CloudMonkey like api discovery and show/hide/block, buttons/sections based on what is allowedn* URL router to navigate to resources, and clicking back button does not close the UIn* Easy to maintain, implement and extend via plugins etc.n* Does not take months to develop and port existing implementation to the new onen* Configurable, theme-able, don't use our own UI framework, but consider something like Vue/React/Angular etc.n* Explore a components based idea, show an api-auto-discovery approach to auto-generate boiler plate for UI component based on an API's request and response paramsn* Make UI more communicative about underlying infra state in real time with modern graphical libraries
