Title: Customized CloudStack in Leaseweb
Publication date: 2019-09-20
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	In this talk we will share how Leaseweb customized the CloudStack project to serve our business model and our customers, by doing some improvements and do some bug fixes. We always focused on upgrading our fork to the latest in the community while making sure all our improvements are ported to the latest version. In this talk we will tell you about some features and fixes we did like: - multiple NICs feature, - NoVNC, autoscaling, - SSL offloading in load balancer - and other changes made to serve some of our customers' needs. We also love to give the community as we take from it, so we open PRs to release our improvements to the community and based on the community reactions to this talk will start to open new PRs of these changes.
