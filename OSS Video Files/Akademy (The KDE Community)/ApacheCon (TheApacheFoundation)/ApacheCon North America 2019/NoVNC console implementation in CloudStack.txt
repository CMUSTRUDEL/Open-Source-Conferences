Title: NoVNC console implementation in CloudStack
Publication date: 2019-09-20
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	NoVNC is an open-source browser based VNC client, implemented using HTML5 technologies (Web Sockets, Canvas) with encryption (wss://) support. Proposed NoVNC implementation provides better performance and is more responsive when compared to the current ajax-based console in Apache CloudStack. Our implementation is based on NoVNC and websockify. Websockify is a websocket proxy converting WebSocket request from browser to TCP request and then forward it to VNC server. We have already implemented a NoVNC console for CloudStack 4.13. This new console is smooth and very stable. It can be accessed by multiple sessions at the same time and easily integrated into other platforms. During this talk we will demonstrate how NoVNC console is implemented in CloudStack and how VNC password authentication is implemented in NoVNC and websockify.
