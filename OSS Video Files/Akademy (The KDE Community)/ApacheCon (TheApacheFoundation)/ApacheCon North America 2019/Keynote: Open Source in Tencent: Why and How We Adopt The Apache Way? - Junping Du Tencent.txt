Title: Keynote: Open Source in Tencent: Why and How We Adopt The Apache Way? - Junping Du Tencent
Publication date: 2019-09-12
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	As one of the largest internet company in the world, Tencent is doing more and more contributions to open source world, include: open source more than 70 projects, and join many open source community with developing features and patches and contribute back. In Tencent, we have an official open source department to drive and support open source project from incubating stage. In practice, we actually adopt Apache way to manage whole process in a way of bottom-up. In this talk, we will show why we adopt Apache way and how we do it in a local company with a different culture.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,649
good morning everyone so thanks rich for

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,469
introduce introduce myself and it's

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,650
always pressure to speak you know after

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,260
the James Gosling but I'm at the Javits

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,630
evaporites you know I personally per fan

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,050
of Java so thanks to Gosling although

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,869
he's already left

00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:28,170
okay so today I'm talking about the open

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,960
source intense sense and how we're gonna

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,320
do and why we are following you know the

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:40,290
Apache way so talking a little bit about

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,870
myself so I have a two hats so one has

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:47,100
in the community I'm a long-term Hadoop

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,430
contributors commuters and PMC and also

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,890
I'm a patchy software foundation member

00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:55,800
on the other hat it's a company had here

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,750
was the chair of the attention

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,750
open-source alliance is its organization

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,930
that's helping the different team of the

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,180
ten cent to be to involving the open

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,689
source you know inside outside of the

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,030
company the other row is kind of you

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,080
know I'm taking care of the big data

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:20,070
team on the storage compute and and data

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:24,479
like directions of tenzin big data so

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:26,700
here's a quick survey here is how many

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,509
we guys have ever hear about company

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Tencent can you raise your hand okay so

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,310
they're a bunch of people so that any of

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,630
you know tens actually offering the

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:43,649
public our services okay very few of

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,899
them broken my heart anyway so test

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,360
actually recognize mostly like here you

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,909
know you know customer oriented

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:56,149
companies that means we are offering you

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:58,890
knows a lot of services like a WeChat

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:00,750
the QQ that is a social network things

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,479
and also we're providing some

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,469
entertaining services like international

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,800
game an internet game and also the video

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,470
and the music stuff so but actually we

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,440
also provide

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,430
the public class offering across the

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:26,130
world we have more than 15 available

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:29,070
zones across five continent so back to

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,570
the topic so here we are talking here in

00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,420
the patchy corn talking about the

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,230
pathway I think that a lot of the

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:40,920
principles about the pathway that we are

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,620
really respect and we really try to

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,020
follow I think one of the most important

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,750
role is community over the code that

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,360
means we are you know more valuate on

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,550
the people and the contributors rather

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,150
than the code the code can be improved

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,190
but have to gathering more and more you

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,580
know smart passionate people to join

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,260
this community I think another some

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,270
other roles is also important like you

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,430
the charity we have to you know

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,900
comparing with proprietary software we

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,700
need to offering some free open-source

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,280
software for the public goods I think

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,560
just like we providing the we chansik

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,720
use all the software today you know to

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,480
the to the world it's kind of free for

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,610
public goods and also the consensus I

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,580
think that's it's quite quite any

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,110
important things that we don't have to

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,750
using power don't have to give in the

00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,420
voting power and maybe we can through

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,239
the discussion the opening discussion to

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,709
make the consensus to achieve the things

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,530
we are we want so this is a roadmap for

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,380
Tinson open-source how's it going

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,489
because a long time ago you know the

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:55,110
tension already you know 21st year so

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,110
it's a you know one years older than

00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,989
apache so in the long journey of this

00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:04,080
company there's no much you know

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,260
open-source genes so in the long term

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,900
and in the long term at a long time it's

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:14,340
it's a closed source perpetuate software

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:18,419
is more preferred way or it's a standard

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,640
way or the default ways but now we are

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,880
moving towards the more and more you

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,930
know open source direction or open

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,770
communication direction so basically

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,740
there is that

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:34,110
the first steps is inner source that we

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:36,090
make the code available across all the

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,909
teams so that all the team across the

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,889
company can work together because

00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:43,169
previously the different teams is

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:47,129
working on their own things some of the

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:51,900
Saints can be overlap each other without

00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:54,150
too many negotiate or collaborations up

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,610
the English inner source or we

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,560
consolidate the resource and we also you

00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,509
know form a lot of you know bigger team

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,030
to do the biggest things and there's

00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,039
some technology innovation what happens

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,009
there and we bring some of those things

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,210
to the public we make it open source we

00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:13,979
make it available for public access for

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,110
so that's the second stage and this

00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:19,860
stage we can bring you know outside of

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:24,990
resource in helping to improve the code

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:29,460
the design and bring more scene arrows

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:32,509
to join the projects and insert this we

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:36,060
can earn some you know you more and more

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,740
technology influence there and as at the

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,630
self and the search step if you want to

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,500
this projects open source code can be

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:46,319
used as many as possible by the public

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:49,319
and make the ecosystem in more houses

00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,199
than we are moving to the cert step that

00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,330
is open community that means the code

00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,789
and project is not owned by one company

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,310
but is owned by the whole community

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:02,819
maybe Sur party foundation like Apache

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,900
and in this way the people you know from

00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:09,180
all kinds of piece of the society even

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,150
your competitors of the company can join

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,759
to make the code to make the project in

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,400
a corner so that is a step so we're

00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,029
moving from the first step one to step

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,469
three

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:24,630
so that is our journey and our romance

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:28,080
so yeah along this room and we do a lot

00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,960
of contributions for Apache we're you

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:36,440
know platinum sponsor and we are the

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,440
first one from China also

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,580
yeah also we other than this is a

00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,390
sponsor we also do a lot of

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,570
contributions to the you know to the

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,300
projects like we have some commuters and

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:57,080
PMC is from you know like Hadoop spark

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,540
fling HBase you know a lot of these

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,360
projects and also we're helping with

00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:08,320
some release effort because we have a

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:10,460
large cluster we have you know

00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,740
application or environment you can help

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,130
in with these efforts

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,630
other than the Apache foundations the

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,460
other foundations were also sponsor like

00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,010
the Linux Foundation server stack and

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,220
more ADB so basically the company might

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,500
try to become a more open source

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:31,400
friendly so we try to invest more

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,230
resource into an apache and other

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,570
foundations like would put more people

00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:38,810
there would put more resources there

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:41,630
with more code and project and also to

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,330
spawn you know spawns more activities of

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,310
the open source the here is that we're

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,710
also building some local community

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,930
efforts for a patch projects just like

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,080
the picture shows we organizing Hadoop

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,890
and spark we'd have with tens or even

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,419
hundreds of people to join to better

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:08,230
promote the Apache projects okay so

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:11,750
let's narrow down a with big data

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:14,390
projects with the Apache so as we know

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,040
the Apache is very successful you know

00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:19,910
holding some projects thing in the Big

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:23,030
Data area so I would like to say a party

00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,840
is just let Sookie per why because it

00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:29,750
smells a lot of animals right so head

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,349
you have no elephant you know the hive

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,660
is his is some bees and also the flink

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,760
is your school anyway a lot of animals

00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:42,169
you know in the big data ecosystem it's

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,710
it is its with animals so it causes a

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:48,020
storage to compute to see co2 streams to

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:49,589
know Seco to monitor all the things

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,540
about big data

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,029
you can find something in Apache and

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,839
also in all of the world the biggest war

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:57,120
is Big Data

00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,000
you cannot leave you know with the

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,089
Apache projects I think that's the good

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,839
things and the great things for Apache

00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:09,300
Software Foundation is doing back to the

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,459
tents and we also have a big data

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,100
company will consume a lot of a big data

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:17,700
then every day we are have a trillions

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:20,640
of records you know in the moving into

00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:24,899
and housing inside outside of $0.10 we

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,149
have many many largest cluster in the

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:30,029
world maybe more than tens of thousands

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:35,220
in largest cluster and so that's means

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:36,990
we need a high-performance clusters to

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,839
handle into processing this kind of data

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,899
so we have some you know boat records

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,500
you know back to year 2016 for the you

00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:49,620
know sorting benchmark so how do make

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:53,149
you make it about one hour and the

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:55,310
sparkle make it to 20 minutes and I mean

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:57,390
2016 we make it to one point five

00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:01,740
minutes you know with the improved

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:04,470
Hadoop and spark things so that's is

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,380
that's a performance part other than the

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,769
poor fun part we need something like

00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:15,720
data like to handling store any you know

00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:17,760
and loaded all the kind of data

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,339
structured on semi structured on

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,860
structure of cater so data like that is

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:27,660
kind of a buzzword you know in the big

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:31,170
data industry but what is a big data

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,790
like it is so in our outstanding I have

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,100
a different layers so the on the layer

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,920
it should be a storage to store where

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,199
you can store all kinds of data so HDFS

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,529
ozone is kind of thinking serving in

00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:46,470
this way to be a bit like storage so the

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:47,459
the middle layers have to be a data like

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,459
management

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,130
it's kind of offering the catalog

00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:57,870
service that's providing them a

00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:02,270
governance of the metadata and make the

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:05,720
data it can be accessible easily by the

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,760
applications and also the big data data

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,370
like analytics helping you know an

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,460
unified way to access and date and no

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:18,890
matter where it's it's loaded from you

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:20,840
know different engines so here we're

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,930
building you know data Lake solutions

00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,570
with Apache projects just like this

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,910
picture shows we have school we have a

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,310
tube and cue that you bank you haven't

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,790
be Apache protein yet but it's getting

00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:37,730
like I said later it's what we you know

00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,740
handle the data moving to the data Lake

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:43,730
and also we have HD a fast

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:47,060
ozone and iceberg that can store your

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,760
data into it and better and easy to

00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,640
access by the engines a compute engine

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,180
DiCicco engines and on top of that is a

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,030
spark you know hive and Libby to be

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:03,410
either to make sure the data can be easy

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:06,590
access by the in different ways and also

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,630
there are some public noble service is

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,610
the saplings are offering and other

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,640
catalysts were happening with metadata

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,690
service and also the air flow for job

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,730
scheduling stuff so as the instance in

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,210
the cloud so that intention to have

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:29,240
sparkling data warehouse and offering

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:30,890
you know this enterprise red is their

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,440
warehousing stuff it's not like your

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,260
traditional deborah houses can handle

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:43,160
with all kinds of data so that is

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:47,210
sparkling so let's back to the tube mq i

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:50,110
just say it's not Apache project yet but

00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:55,430
it's what going to open source it and

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:58,000
it's just like another mq project so we

00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:01,280
are you know party we have some Kafka

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,550
pasta and other and queues but widely as

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:08,180
another empty project actually the tube

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:11,990
MQ already developed and get usually

00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,700
intensive for almost seven years so back

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,650
to year you know back to time several

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,650
years ago is there's no much to

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:21,770
many options to make sure you know your

00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:25,220
have a message queue with such high

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,500
syrup urge such low latency can be run

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,529
slow stable back to that years is

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,470
there's no much choice so that's why we

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:37,120
decide to undeveloped this from the

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:41,410
beginning from scratch and it has some a

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:45,140
lot of you know benefits and advantages

00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:47,810
like other than the high throughput the

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,050
low latency it's a mess architecture is

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,839
it's good without the bottleneck from

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,810
the zookeeper and also it's stable

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,120
operation in seven years because a lot

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,930
of design details trade-offs it's based

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,300
on the stable that's a quick

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,370
architecture of this so just like a lot

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,770
of you know message queue they have you

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,760
know master we have a Booker we have

00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:16,190
consumer we have a producer so these

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,420
hard which is you know in the connection

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,670
between them to make sure each

00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,190
components is connected and also the

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,070
data is a flow from the producer to the

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,180
broker and across the broker broker to

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,339
the consumer

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,410
this is same similar with some other

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,360
cute but things we're getting rid of the

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,440
zookeeper in the keep on the key pass

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:41,420
the mustard itself can be have the x-ray

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:44,839
mechanism so it's much stable and you

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,520
know zookeeper based solutions also we

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,070
have support the future in the server

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,870
side that means as the broker side it

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,060
doesn't have to be a client set or the

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,709
you know consumer side that means a lot

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,230
of traffic a lot of data is actually

00:14:54,709 --> 00:15:00,140
care future before they're sending to

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:04,520
the consumer and also there's many

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:09,350
improvement for you know RPC and also

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:12,529
the the messages store under under the

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:17,060
table and also a lot of optimization on

00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:21,980
the load balance so let's do a quick

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:24,760
work to make qmq life so so far it's

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,760
still a profit

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:35,260
project and now let's make it public

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:54,110
oops

00:15:44,990 --> 00:16:05,480
I just yeah I just waiting too long okay

00:15:54,110 --> 00:16:08,360
so it's public you know yeah it's a

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,090
actually are very small stat for my you

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,820
know it's more clicky for myself but

00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:20,330
it's a great milestone for the team and

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,870
thank you everyone for support that so

00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,880
here

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,950
thank you there here's a link of that

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,960
and we plan to donation to Apache so we

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,700
already find the champions but we still

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,460
need to find you know experience the

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:38,330
mentors so if you have interest you know

00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,630
interest on these projects just call you

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:44,330
know just peanuts and also we call for

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:48,590
the contributors users and thanks to

00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:52,280
everyone for intentions so open source

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:55,910
is is a long journey maybe a lifelong

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,040
journey so we'd like to sing Apache you

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,690
know because this is a long it's journey

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,880
is a too long sometimes that we can be

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,720
confused if we cannot see the right

00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,140
directions and I think a pathway it just

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,910
like here you know that got the the guy

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,860
that's already stand on top of the

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,620
mountain and show you which you wrote it

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:19,570
is so thank you Apache my personally and

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,570
from the company thanks

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,930
