you can come and

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,920
have your keys signed and build the web

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,080
of trust there is more information about

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,130
that on the website and in the mobile

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,600
app later in the week we have a few

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,310
other events that you won't want to miss

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,860
the first of these is the lightning

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,890
talks this is an annual tradition where

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,959
you the attendees can give a five minute

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,270
talk on whatever it is that's of

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,420
interest to you that's presumably at

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,850
least somewhat related to Apache there's

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,450
only five rules it will take five

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,340
minutes

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,280
either way at the end of which you'll be

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,950
thrown off the stage and you can't use

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,640
any slides and it can be any topic like

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,380
I said each evening we have birds of a

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,840
feather sessions these are places where

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,390
you can talk with people with shared

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,269
interests and these will be happening

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,870
all over the show floor you can sign up

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,269
by emailing me at our Bowen at Apache

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,110
org that that link is also on the

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:19,350
website or just accost me in the hallway

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,540
every morning at 7:00 Jean Fredrick

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,220
Clair and a number of other crazy people

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,630
we'll be meeting in the lobby and you

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,180
can meet with them if you want to go

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:31,560
running all day every day in Laughlin 3

00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,350
which is just down the hall we have the

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,070
hackathon that is for you to work on

00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,959
projects with the rest of the community

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,170
it's you can work on code or

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,609
documentation or design or decision or

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,140
just get to know the other people in

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,799
your community we encourage you to take

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:53,250
advantage of that space and then finally

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,140
on Wednesday the Ballerina community

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,820
will have a hackathon all day long in

00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:03,570
the Lake Mead rooms we do have a mobile

00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,519
app the app itself is called crowd

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,390
compass attendee hub you can get that

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,400
from from your App Store and then search

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,280
for Apache Con to load the content for

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,289
this event in order to use that you'll

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,459
just need to use the name under which

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:22,620
you registered and it'll die that will

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,680
allow you to build your own schedule and

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,250
keep track of what you want to attend

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,930
if you do social media we would really

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,759
appreciate it if you would use these

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,699
hashtags so that we can track what

00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,979
people are saying about us and respond

00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:40,199
to your questions if you want to ask us

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,660
anything or have any problems that you

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,479
need addressed we also have a slack

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,979
channel and the URL for joining that is

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,419
on this slide and of course you don't

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,250
have time to write that down so it is

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,250
also on the front page of the apache

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:57,990
khan website if you want to join us on

00:04:53,250 --> 00:05:00,180
slack which brings us to our first

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,010
keynote I mentioned that we are

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,080
celebrating the 20th birthday of the

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,820
foundation and I would like to welcome

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,620
to the stage some of the people that

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,320
helped make that happen to talk about

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,020
both how things were in the old days and

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,620
the vision going forward so if you will

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,820
all come on up we can get started thank

00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:34,800
you for your attention and please

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:37,530
welcome our first keynote panel hello so

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,289
welcome wall thank you for all all for

00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:43,440
showing up I see a lot of filled seats

00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:46,770
and I have to say that my memory of

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,440
apache khan like in the early 2000s the

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,520
9:00 a.m. slot sort of had a attendance

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,490
issue given it is in vegas so thank you

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,860
all for being here I'm gonna ask these

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,300
people here on stage a subset of the

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,340
founders of the apache server foundation

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:08,479
which by the way i'm not a part of and

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,190
and tell you a bit about the history and

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,199
how fetching influence their lives so

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,760
mark why don't you tell us how you got

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,150
involved with the Apache civil

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,150
foundation

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:26,310
thank sander it was 1995 and as Brian

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,280
here who invited me to join the new HD

00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,810
Biddy mailing list I'd found and fixed

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,199
the number of security issues in the

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,840
NCSA web server and as a fellow

00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,720
administrator I'd sent them to Brian for

00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,780
his site as well but it wasn't until

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,479
1998 that we actually first met all

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,130
together and that was where we discussed

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,130
the creation of the Apache Software

00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:53,250
Foundation so we did what all developers

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,110
loved to do and we hiked down cliff and

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,590
took pictures at a waterfall which is

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:01,110
this picture here now this actually

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,780
really worried me because here were most

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:07,139
of the Apache developers at the time in

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,970
the same place at the same time and it's

00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:14,669
not like San Francisco's known for

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:17,039
natural disasters also Microsoft were

00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:22,349
really worried we were taking share away

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:25,289
from them rather rapid pace and perhaps

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:28,349
more plausible as a risk was that we'd

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,240
end up at the San Francisco down in

00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,900
Fisherman's Wharf eating the same cheap

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,330
dodgy sushi that's the way my brain

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,219
works I I was seeing it as a risk and

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,530
and the code was out there like the code

00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:42,690
was already there on tens of thousands

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,090
of machines around the world but the

00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:47,729
people were what mattered the people had

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,469
the same same goals the same vision and

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:52,440
the same mission and we wouldn't be here

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:55,740
today if somebody had happened back to

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,750
us then and when I was thinking about

00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,190
coming up to talk to you today that's

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,199
what kind of resonated with me that

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,210
that's the Apache way that the community

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,250
is more important than the code and this

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,069
was a very good to me demonstration of

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,830
that

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,500
so Apache has weaves and intertwined its

00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,960
way through the last 20 years of my life

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,030
in in every way from writing Apache week

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,759
joining C to net writing a stronghold

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,620
web server then when C to net was

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:28,440
getting bought by Red Hat dealing with

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:30,380
lawyers is how I met my wife then at an

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,940
Apache con early on

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,210
Gooper Apache developers came together

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,840
and founded OpenSSL came from that as

00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:40,669
well it's a mixed blessing knowing

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,250
security it's not a job that people

00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,710
particularly want to do at Red Hat the

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,980
VP of engineering called me up one day

00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:52,100
and he said mark you know security we

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,230
don't have a security team you're it and

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,420
that was my next 18 years of my life

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,630
handling security issues at Red Hat and

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,860
until I could no longer deal with

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,650
handling security issues at red happened

00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,870
now it's fortunate I work part time and

00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:11,060
I spent half of my time working on

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,270
Apache and the other half working on

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:19,150
open SSL upstream handling security

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,150
issues Thank You Sandra

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,590
Thank You Marc it's awesome

00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,820
Cliff's maybe you can explain why we

00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,820
were actually setting up a foundation

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,790
and that was a really great hike that we

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,290
had when we all got together and met for

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,850
the first time it was really great

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,740
meeting people that I had been working

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:47,990
with for years on a mailing list at the

00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:52,220
time Brian and I were founding a company

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:54,050
and we needed a web server we found

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,190
other people that were also working on

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,990
companies and needed a good web server

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:03,140
we realized that if none of us

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,800
individually could do enough code and

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:09,110
create a quality product that we could

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,630
use in our own commercial ventures so

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:13,760
open source was great you know allowed

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:17,330
us to give a little bit and get a lot

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,240
back and that's one of the reasons why

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:23,210
Apache the original HTTP server adopted

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,130
a very business friendly license but a

00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:30,310
business friendly license is really not

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:33,200
enough what we really needed was some

00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:36,470
some infrastructure to allow existing

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,190
corporate entities a place to call the

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:43,460
ability to give donations to run things

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:44,480
like Apache Con and it helped the

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,750
developers also

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,100
it let us have better infrastructure

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,740
gave a little bit of formality to the

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,200
community allowed us to define what

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,790
member responsibilities were more than

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,430
just yo hey here's your commit

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,790
privileges and of course I'll mention it

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,519
again Apache con has has been great you

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,980
know these days I'm not actively

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,769
contributing to the Apache Software

00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,490
Foundation but it has affected my life

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:16,040
in ways that I would not have expected

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:19,730
20-plus years ago I've made many friends

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,070
who I've known for years my current job

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:25,130
which is running a company deploying

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,339
event technology was a direct result of

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,649
my participation at Apache Con you know

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:33,529
so the participation has been a great

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,600
influence and I'm very excited you know

00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:37,190
when I show up at Apache Con to see how

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,589
much things have changed

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,810
and how much everybody here has taken

00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:45,480
things forward so I appreciate being a

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:48,600
part of the organization Thank You cliff

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,600
[Applause]

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,810
so Lars we we can help but notice that

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,240
you're not in this picture were you

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,129
like late to the party yeah it was I

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,610
guess I was a bit late to the party

00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:05,499
yeah my name is last Ida bushed so

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,040
unfortunately I missed that initial

00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:11,410
meeting and get together because I only

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,639
joined the Apache group a month later

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,319
July in 1998 I was a like how I got

00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,769
involved basically I was a student at

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:23,759
that time and a German publisher

00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:25,779
approached me because I wanted to

00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:30,220
publish a book about the Apache web

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:32,199
server so while researching and playing

00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,769
around and testing various things with

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:38,259
Apache I rented it into a lot of issues

00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:40,899
bugs and started sending a lot of bug

00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:45,490
reports to the Apache group a lot of bug

00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:47,709
reports and eventually because some were

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,350
slow to be picked up eventually I fixed

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,490
the bugs myself so I submitted some

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:57,579
patches as well so eventually they I

00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:00,250
received well because I needed to finish

00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:02,709
the book so I was chasing them because

00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,240
they weren't quick enough to to tell me

00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,829
okay is the code wrong it's the

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,230
documentation wrong in some cases they

00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,629
didn't know what to write in the book so

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,220
eventually I received an invitation to

00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:16,600
join the Apache group July 1998

00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,819
obviously I was I was very honored but

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,220
also a little bit surprised because I

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:23,470
thought well okay I've submitted a lot

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,990
of bug reports and a few patches here

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,360
and there but I thought it's not really

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:30,879
enough to really be invited to be part

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,790
of the Apache group and I remember an

00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,550
email so when I pointed this out after

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,879
accepting the invite of obviously I got

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:42,610
an email from Ben Lauria where he said

00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,920
if the Apache group measured

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,249
contributions based on the number of

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,379
lines of code contributed it would be

00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:53,620
poorer for it and I think that statement

00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:56,379
is still very very valid today for the

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,220
NSF in general because code

00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:59,500
contributions

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,470
sorry not code contributions come in all

00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,610
sizes and shapes it's sometimes the non

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,430
code contribution

00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:12,460
that matter even more and have made the

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:13,390
SF what it is today apart from from code

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,790
contributions

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,130
I've also immediately after the SF was

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,830
created basically initially we had three

00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,260
projects at the web server we had the

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,240
Jakarta project and we had a conference

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,690
planning project with the intention of

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,700
producing Apache conferences and I

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,160
jumped basically at the opportunity of

00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,960
helping with conference planning because

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,900
yeah I thought it was a very good

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,480
opportunity to well how to put it to

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,450
educate the world about what Apache is

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,870
what open source is and it was a very

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:50,140
good way to to build the developer and

00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:53,530
user community around the patch and I

00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:56,890
think it is what has grown the or what

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:58,300
what helped to grow Apache the NSF into

00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,000
what it is today

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,420
and so I did that for like for like 10

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,900
10 10 years helping to create these

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:11,740
Apache conferences and related events

00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:13,900
and I think another reason why just

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,210
going back to what Woodcliff said about

00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,650
the Apache Software license I think

00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:23,140
that's one of the other reasons that's

00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:25,780
very important and and actually resulted

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,810
in Apache becoming that popular in my

00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,210
opinion because if someone goes to the

00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,950
Apache website you can be assured that

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,260
whatever you download in terms of the

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:40,300
application it will be published under

00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,920
the apache software license Thank You

00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:45,360
Lars

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,360
[Applause]

00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:51,959
Roy I know you're gonna love this so the

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,320
original Apache group had had a number

00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:58,670
of traits and we have something called

00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,490
the Apache way today what did we capture

00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:05,069
since the start and what did you want to

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:09,170
make sure that we kept until today from

00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:11,910
those original traits thanks Andy

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,620
so I'm Roy fielding you may know me from

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:20,009
my work on legal stuff or something else

00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:22,170
but when I started Apache I first met

00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:23,310
Bryon at the first web conference in

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,930
Geneva

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,690
but other than that I hadn't met anyone

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,269
else what I was doing was working as on

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:34,470
the HTTP specification for the IETF and

00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:38,730
working with the w3c to do that and what

00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,860
I found was that I needed a way to

00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,680
demonstrate the changes that we're

00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,480
making to http in a way that had at

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,250
least equal weight with the work that

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,190
was being done in it Microsoft and

00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:53,910
Netscape regarding their servers so for

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:57,329
me it was both a way to extend that the

00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:59,910
great stuff that we did as creating the

00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:01,709
original World Wide Web project which

00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,329
itself was a big collaborative software

00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:07,439
project spread across the entire world

00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:09,600
and which had just then moved into being

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,510
a commercial effort more than anything

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,309
else and so when I heard that Brian was

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:19,020
setting up this group I was the eager to

00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:20,400
join and to get involved and I I would

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,429
say that the most important

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,709
characteristic of Apache Apache group

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:29,280
bleeding into the ASF was this notion

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:30,590
that we were all over the world this the

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,140
meeting that you see in the picture is

00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:37,110
our first actual meeting together three

00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:42,270
years after we started the project so we

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:45,540
did three years in which I had met Brian

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:49,260
in Geneva and I had met Robert tau at

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,570
MIT but that was it that's the extent of

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,020
the I think by the time we started the

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,289
ASF there was almost 30 members so 30

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,169
people I've been collaborating with for

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:05,389
basically for five four years at the

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:07,830
time and the most of you know for me

00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:09,119
doing that via the mailing this was the

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:14,429
most natural way because that's how we

00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:17,789
built the web but for for the group as a

00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:20,220
whole the central problem we found was

00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:23,039
that how do we figure out how to

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,049
collaborate because it wasn't just that

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,359
we're all working on a common software

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,039
project it's that we all had distinct

00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,989
interests in that project so we had

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,679
commercial interests we had someone

00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:39,409
running an ISP we had three graduate

00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:42,139
students doing degrees and actually for

00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:44,519
various various areas astrophysics

00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:45,779
robotics mine was in software

00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,210
engineering and I was interested in

00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:50,389
building something like github of course

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:56,159
get up did it better

00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:58,830
using our software of course and so that

00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,330
was our perspective and the interesting

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:02,580
thing about I have a background in

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,369
political science and computer science

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,529
so I I spend a lot of time talking about

00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:10,220
how to organize people and how to think

00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:13,379
about people but the thing about Apache

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:16,109
was it was entirely organic in nature in

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:18,059
the sense that you know we overnight we

00:19:16,109 --> 00:19:20,460
came up with a system for for voting

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:22,739
about patches plus one minus one zero

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,190
that's just something that Rob parts

00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:27,629
Hill made up on the fly there's no there

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,849
is no collaborative agreement about

00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:32,279
there was no plan involved which is I'm

00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:35,039
just gonna say plus one and then we all

00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,019
follow that so it worked so we kept it

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,419
and that was the thing we kept working

00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:41,609
on the mailing list on things that that

00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:45,029
worked we kept things that didn't work

00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:47,539
out we just silently forgot about and

00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:50,129
like any group effort it wasn't it was

00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,039
you know all about the people it wasn't

00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:55,409
about the software and I think the most

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,359
important thing that that we pushed into

00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:00,450
the foundation when we founded the

00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:03,330
foundation was this notion that everyone

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,279
should govern themselves for the

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:09,450
creation of their individual projects so

00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,600
we we in the server group had a notion

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,590
of how we work best

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,330
together but we couldn't tell the other

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,860
projects how to do that it's something

00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,470
they had to learn on their own and

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,480
possibly modify on their own so I think

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:25,030
that's one of the the keys to our excess

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,380
success was that we provided that

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:32,429
flexibility to the foundation as a whole

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,429
Thank You Roy it's a great answer

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:41,380
so you mentioned change over time so Jim

00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:44,440
you've been a constant factor on on the

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:47,470
board of Apache almost it's a start

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,710
can you walk us through like the changes

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:54,309
over like the last two decades and how

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,929
Apache influenced utilize when santur

00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,570
told me I was going to be talking about

00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:03,820
that I had this look of horror on my

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:06,549
face for me what got me involved with

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,340
with Apache was at the time I was

00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:10,840
working for for NASA Goddard even back

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,669
then I would consider myself a gray

00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:19,929
beard because I loved UNIX and at the

00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:22,720
time NASA was just using VAX VMS and we

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:24,700
were all moving to two Mac workstations

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,450
and Apple came out with this software

00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,190
called aux Apple UNIX which I fell in

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,799
love with I thought it was great but

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,620
none of the software that was powering

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,840
the internet was actually ported to that

00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,080
so that's what I did I actually ported a

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,690
bunch of software over including Apache

00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,880
HTTP D and that was the first thing that

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:48,220
I did so there were some compunction

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,549
some patches that I provided and just

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,650
sent to the mailing list and I received

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,650
some positive feedback some manam

00:21:53,650 --> 00:22:01,539
positive feedback and learned from from

00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,760
all of that and it basically changed my

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:07,870
life by changing my career path I mean

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,200
since that time I stopped working for

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:14,020
NASA I focused mostly on the open source

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,520
and software development space and its

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,559
really really enriched my life one of

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,630
the things I say a lot of times at

00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,390
conferences is that open source an

00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,820
Apache have done more for me than I

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,370
think that I can ever

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,100
give back and so a lot of what I tried

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,110
to do is do everything I can to give

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,400
back to the community one of the common

00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:35,280
themes that people were talking about

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,100
was friends you know you make so many

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,050
good friends in this environment I think

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,630
it goes even deeper than that you

00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:45,750
actually make people meet friends that

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,050
you consider our family to you and

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:51,150
that's important to the DNA of us it's

00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:52,980
that sense of community that sense of

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,290
family which i think is very very

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,180
important to us and I think that's

00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,790
something that is really really hard to

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:03,300
maintain for 20 plus years especially

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:07,130
when you go from a small group of thirty

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:10,340
people to a large large number of

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:12,630
members an even larger number of

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,400
committers and contributors how do you

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,020
maintain that how do you maintain that

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,570
sense of family how do you maintain that

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,760
sense of community and I think that's

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,400
probably the biggest challenge that that

00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,470
all communities are reaching with

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,110
nowadays and I think that we basically

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,410
have the answer to that and it's like

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,450
all the tenants of how we build and grow

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,600
our communities how we build and grow

00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,730
our software projects that's how you

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,670
maintain that you maintain that openness

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,220
you maintain that that that peer respect

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,720
and one of the biggest changes one of

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,990
the things that that's under asked me to

00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,110
talk about was the the changes in the

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,670
board for example I've been I was up

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,190
until last year I was been serving on

00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,290
the board for you know basically since

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,690
day one and I think we've been blessed

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,930
with a board every every year have been

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,030
passionate people who have the best

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,790
interests of the foundation at heart and

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,640
I think that that's basically one of the

00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:14,910
cornerstones of help us guide that is

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,010
that these directors are our leaders but

00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,690
also stewards and they're really the

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:22,920
people that we look up to when we hope

00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:25,170
to emulate at times so I think that my

00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,740
call to action before I pass over to

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,450
Brian would be get much more involved

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,490
really really give back to this

00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:35,130
community because again I promise you

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,070
that whatever you give back to the

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:43,090
community you will get back

00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:43,090
tenfold I promise you thanks Jim

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:53,660
Brian you were very early in the whole

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,090
Apache group I think it would be

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,770
interesting to hear from you first of

00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,500
all what has Apache done to your life

00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,780
but also how do you see Apache in the

00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:07,250
future

00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:08,720
great thanks cinder so let's see first I

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,460
want to note that you know the folks

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,620
here up here on stage were the ones

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,180
lucky enough to be able to both respond

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,210
to an email suggesting they come out to

00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,130
San Francisco in June of 1998 and lucky

00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,480
enough to been able to work on things

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,180
publicly when a lot of people at the

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,100
time might not have right and not to get

00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,580
like overly nostalgic about the past or

00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,230
whatever but the Internet in 1998 or 95

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,810
was a very different Internet than we

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,420
have today right it was a lot easier to

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:39,740
be a 19 year old kid it a freshman in

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:42,080
computer science I like me jumping on to

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,910
an IETF working group mailing list and

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,800
spewing nonsense and having somebody

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,780
like Roy correcting me on that right

00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,360
which was really awesome in fact I think

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:53,540
the reason why like I gravitated to the

00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,550
NCSA working group the NCSA httpd list

00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,680
was the fact that like I could ask

00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,140
people how did this work here's a bug

00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,330
that I think fixes a problem or a patch

00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,220
that I think fixes a bug or adds some

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,570
feature and and there were actually

00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,670
people who were nice enough to be able

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,950
to respond and tell me how completely

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,330
broken that patch was and not only that

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,860
but because it was so annoying that it

00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,930
was so broken they would actually fix it

00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,750
right so like this open source things

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,280
like a great scam I could you know fix

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,870
bugs and have all these friends or I

00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,440
could have all these friends fix the

00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,720
bugs in my code and so thinking about

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,160
like what happens from here what what

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,920
goes forward I want to think about that

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,380
that time right it was a time when you

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,150
could there was actually a rather large

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,980
window that I think is narrowed the

00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,810
window was you know you're confident

00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,790
enough about your code and your skills

00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,800
to be willing to share publicly what

00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:45,830
you've done but then also humble enough

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,960
to be able to take criticism and

00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:50,030
commentary and build from that rather

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,509
than you know Crouch into a hole and go

00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,879
forget it

00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:54,589
not ever sharing again right that window

00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,759
has narrowed out there in the rest of

00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:58,039
the internet everybody is online

00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,570
everybody has an opinion about why your

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,909
code sucks and people tend to be less

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,679
willing to help you so one thing that I

00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,269
want to make sure we do more of in the

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,009
future going forward is expand that

00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:09,049
window right really fight against the

00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:11,029
forces that make people hesitant to

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:12,349
share make people like afraid of the

00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,929
feedback they're gonna get we've got to

00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:17,690
invert that and and encourage that and

00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,159
keep that window wide open the second

00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,779
thing that I think has been a hallmark

00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,699
of us that I think is still a fight that

00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,669
we have to fight is we all participate

00:27:22,699 --> 00:27:27,739
in Apache as individuals as not

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:30,889
representatives of a company that we

00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:33,919
work for but as people who are you know

00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:35,929
have names right right and Mark and

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,489
Brian and that we keep our relationships

00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,709
and we keep our reputation and we keep

00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:42,469
our engagements even as we change hats

00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:45,349
and paychecks and geographic locations

00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:46,789
and you know Apache was once described I

00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:49,309
mean it's a non-profit what kind of

00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:50,869
nonprofit I loved the term guild as

00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,969
applied to what we build because that

00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:55,909
the concept of a guild is much less

00:27:52,969 --> 00:27:57,559
about the outputs the the work that gets

00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,329
created although the presumption is that

00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,119
those are high quality but those are

00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:03,469
high quality because of who we are and

00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,419
our connections between ourselves and

00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:07,249
the standard that we all set for each

00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:08,690
other about how we work together that's

00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:10,159
the important thing

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,339
the second important thing and then the

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,169
third for me is so again in these early

00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:18,139
days the internet I think there was a

00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,969
this kind of pregnant kind of assumption

00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:22,219
that what we were building was going to

00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:24,499
matter right it was gonna be something

00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:26,629
that laid the the rails the foundation

00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:29,479
for lots of what was going to follow for

00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:31,339
the next few years and and there are

00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:33,519
people long as who took a lot you know a

00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:36,079
lot of time and careful thought about

00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,969
what we were building and sometimes the

00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:41,269
architects got it right you know with

00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:43,099
tcp/ip or rest or other foundational

00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:46,069
pieces sometimes they got it wildly

00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:48,169
wrong I suggested a header on the HT on

00:28:46,069 --> 00:28:50,419
the dub-dub-dub Talk mailing list called

00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,159
state which would keep track in the

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,779
client side of some interesting

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,849
information so the server could change

00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:57,559
what it told the client which then loom

00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:59,989
on to lea implemented as the cookie

00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,589
header in Netscape Navigator and I'm

00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,840
sorry

00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:04,400
I will try not to do that again

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,580
it's one reason you don't see much

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,710
technologically for me going forward but

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,840
all of us have a role to play and

00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,520
especially now in thinking about the

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,520
technologies that we build and how we

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,780
build them because it's not not only is

00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,880
everybody online at this point

00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:22,160
everybody's glued to their screens and

00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,480
thinking about the design everything

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,820
from the front end all the way the

00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,160
deepest back end is really critical look

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,410
at how things like infinite scroll have

00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,900
now you know caused certain behaviors in

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:35,630
society you know that are subtle but

00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,640
pervasive and either wildly positive or

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,040
in some cases wildly negative and what I

00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,270
really hope that Apache you know but I

00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,490
think it's been and what I hope it

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,740
continues to be is a place where we can

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,330
have these conversations not about just

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,490
about you know does this pull request

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,900
fix that bug but what is the kind of

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,700
technology we want to build

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,660
what what what actually will lead to a

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,950
more generative positive future and and

00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,860
something we're all proud of looking

00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:04,190
back on 20 years later I even from this

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,870
point right so that's I think the rule

00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,550
that I think Apache can play very

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,350
broadly stated and all these new

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,790
technologies you know by virtue of the

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,040
fact it's not just about the web

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,800
technologies it's not just about Java

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,810
it's about the full suite and has really

00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,970
focused on who we are as individuals and

00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,800
finally I want to say you know this is a

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,120
fun panel to be part of you know we're

00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,980
interesting people get to know as if you

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,690
are interested but there's a lot of

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,250
people who could be on the stage you

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,290
should be on this stage people like

00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:32,540
Sally ku dari who got involved with the

00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,850
project months after this photo was

00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,500
taken and have done more I think than

00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,750
anybody else in helping the world

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,190
understand who Apache is and how we work

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,960
people like Denise Cooper

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,240
thank you let's give her a hand please

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,240
she's here in the back somewhere I think

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,350
people like Denise Cooper people like

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,970
Sam Ruby people who I mean we were not a

00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,470
rocket ship that's suddenly now there's

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,960
this satellite in space floating around

00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,090
in stasis this was a snowball effect

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,800
this was we kind of like maybe tip that

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,020
snowball kind of jumped in and as it

00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,910
started rolling but all these people and

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,980
frankly all of you are now participating

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,020
this continuous snowball climb a

00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,860
snowball roll so I don't know if there's

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,170
an end to it but uh

00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,550
I that's you know that's that's just

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,390
what I hope we all do together as the

00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:20,469
Apache community thank you awesome

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,469
[Music]

00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,560
Brian thank you and I think that also

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:28,440
shows like one of the the other traits

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,330
that we always see which is appreciate

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,640
others and and don't make it about you

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:34,980
so really appreciate appreciate the

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,880
humility that you put up here Brian

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,610
that's great
