Title: Keynote: It isn't about the license, it's about the collaboration - Christopher Ferris IBM
Publication date: 2019-09-11
Playlist: ApacheCon North America 2019
Description: 
	There's been a disturbance in the force lately with a number of projects abandoning open source licenses for licenses that carry commercial covenants or constraints, or worse, abandoning open source licensing altogether in favor of source available licensing. This will not end well if the industry doesn't recognize that open source isn't about the license. The value isn't in the source code. It's about fostering a diverse collaborative community of sustainable support and continuous improvement and innovation. In his talk, Christopher, an IBM Fellow and IBM's CTO of Open Technology, will share his perspectives on the value of open governance for open source projects.

so first of all I want to say thank you

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,780
for the honor of getting to speak here

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,620
and that iBM is really proud to be a

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,940
platinum level sponsor for the Pesci con

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,190
we've been involved with Apache pretty

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,130
much since the very beginnings and we're

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,750
happy to continue that partnership so

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,230
topic of my talk today is it's not about

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,019
the license and I'll get into why that

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,489
is but let's just start by sort of

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,050
asserting that you know I think maybe a

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,660
couple of years ago there seemed to be

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,550
this sense that open-source one this is

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,300
the way that software is developed now

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:44,550
is through open-source and yet in the

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,500
two years since that time what we've

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:52,829
seen is we've seen an increasing trend

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:55,649
for open-source providers to change the

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,360
license on their technology their

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,300
open-source technology to either make it

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,820
sort of commercial dual licensed add the

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,769
commons clause to it or even to sort of

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,270
do things like intermingle proprietary

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,830
code with the open source code so that

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,439
it makes it difficult to actually build

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,670
it in a truly open source way and so you

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,830
know I like to say there's been a great

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,479
disturbance in the force right we're

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,110
starting to see this trend this trend is

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,180
coming about because cloud vendors

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:26,700
probably may be unfairly are being

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,960
stigmatized by sort of taking advantage

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,240
of the fact that they can take

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,799
open-source right out of the write-off

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,920
of github or wherever it happens to be

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,299
hosted and deploy it and offer a service

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,140
and they don't have to contribute

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,299
anything back and you know so this is

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,090
this is a reality and I think those

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,520
people that are running projects that

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,840
are feeling that pressure like well

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,880
we're doing all this work we're

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,579
contributing all of this technology out

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,310
there and people aren't sort of giving

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,979
back to the community we are we're

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,820
essentially enabling these other vendors

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:07,259
to monetize something that we built so

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:10,140
my friend Steve O'Grady from red Munk he

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,940
seems to be sort of caught in this cycle

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,200
of having to continually write about oh

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,940
yet there's an

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,270
new open-source license that we have to

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,069
concern ourselves with and more recently

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,739
earlier this year I think he's actually

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,860
written up three stories this year on

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,510
open-source licensing and this was in I

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,190
think the second one they came out and

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,750
his and his point was basically

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,550
commercial open source providers have

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,130
increasingly turned models that blur the

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,600
lines the distinction between the open

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,610
source part and the proprietary software

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,850
in an attempt to access the strengths of

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,319
both with the higher probability that

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,319
we'll end up with the weaknesses instead

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,209
and I think this is this is really very

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,209
prescient of him to sort of highlight

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:55,799
the fact that the attempt try and sort

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,930
of reclaim the mantle say no but this is

00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:00,810
still mine that sort of goes against the

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,220
whole open-source ethos of having

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,260
something that's out there and available

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,519
for people to fork it and take it and do

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,290
whatever they want to do with it now

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,260
the reality of it is though is as I

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,100
mentioned that it is true that there are

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,200
some that are taking the software

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,870
hosting a service monetizing that

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,120
platform without contributing back I

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,880
think increasingly there's pressure

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,829
coming to you know to change that but

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,540
the reality from my perspective is the

00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,000
following that technology leaders do

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,820
more than just consume open-source they

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,709
also give back and I'm trying to sort of

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,980
with this chart highlight the fact that

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,720
iBM has been sort of since the very

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,150
beginnings of the open-source movement

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,549
has been a sort of a primary player

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,859
Brian was just telling me about how he

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,200
sort of recruited the initial ID the

00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,890
amur to contribute back to HTTP back in

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,500
the day and you know hey maybe you could

00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,000
fix some of these bugs and AIX drivers

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,819
and maybe you could fix some of the bugs

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,470
and the os/2 drivers right you know so

00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:07,049
and and of course that wasn't the

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,540
beginning for IBM we had actually been

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:12,109
contributing to the Linux kernel prior

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,239
to that right so you know and in fact

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:20,070
IBM way back in the very beginning about

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:23,370
1998 when we indemnified users of IBM

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,710
products that were using Linux on IBM

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,450
hardware against some of the suits that

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,880
were

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,700
ongoing at the time so we indemnified

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,260
users essentially making it okay for

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,270
enterprises to use open source so you

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,670
know and that started back with Linux of

00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,590
course we were central to helping to

00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,140
establish the Apache Software Foundation

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,720
we're very proud of that we were around

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,700
also to help stand up the Eclipse

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,510
Foundation and sort of seed it with a

00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:56,570
significant contribution of code at the

00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,730
time unheard of really I mean everybody

00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,950
associates IBM with proprietary and

00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,740
mainframe and walk in and stuff like

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,750
that but in fact we've been trying to be

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,180
as open as we possibly can and I've I

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,300
joined IBM basically the mission to help

00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,670
help make it even more open than what it

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,910
was already doing and then we helped

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,940
stand up the Linux Foundation to sort of

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,010
formalize the process of governance over

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,720
not only the Linux kernel but now over

00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,600
what is it about 90 projects I think

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,190
collaborative initiatives 100 yeah so I

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,180
mean it's so it's really starting to

00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:35,300
grow I mean you know fast forward right

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,030
to more recent times and we've been

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,700
focusing on things like docker trying to

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:43,190
get docker the company to take docker

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,350
the software and really make it truly

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,730
openly governed and this is going to be

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,940
sort of where I'm going with a lot of

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:52,730
this talk we worked with cloud foundry

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,580
with the folks at pivotal to bring cloud

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,190
foundry under open governance and I'll

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,870
talk about why that is in a moment we

00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,110
worked with the node community to sort

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,530
of healed the node GS and IO GS Schism

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,760
to bring those two camps together form

00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,460
eventually the open Jas Foundation where

00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,040
but now the project is flourishing all

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,190
right so iBM has sort of been around and

00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,770
trying to help help build these

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,860
communities help them essentially learn

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,870
how to be more than just one company's

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,680
software that happens have a nice

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,680
license on it

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,689
some way an IBM has also done a lot in

00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:45,169
terms of taking software that we've

00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,939
developed in-house and taking that out

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,039
and making that open-source and of

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,900
course that in the very early days I

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,749
know I got my start in open standards

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,900
and open source around XML and so I was

00:06:53,749 --> 00:07:00,949
really pleased when IBM published Xerces

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:04,939
and then zahlen write to sort of satisfy

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,889
the XML driver space but we've done way

00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:09,409
more than that so there's a number of

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:14,089
different projects like open j9 that's

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:16,490
IBM's Java implementation open Liberty

00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,080
which was event it was previous to that

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,029
it was WebSphere and then WebSphere

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,710
Liberty but we've opened it up we've

00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:23,599
made a fully open source project

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,509
inviting others to come and collaborate

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,599
with us on that and contributed open j9

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,370
into eclipse

00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,139
we've even taking you know sort of the

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,580
more advanced cutting edge technology

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:38,240
like Chris kit which is our quantum

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,610
computing SDK and making that fully open

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,919
source and inviting academics around the

00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,319
world to collaborate and contribute not

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,270
only to the development of this sort of

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,319
new world order around quantum computing

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,120
but to also leverage the ability of open

00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,479
hardware that we have available for

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,639
people to use

00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,439
obviously eclipse I mentioned that hyper

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,270
laser fabric the project that Brian and

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,249
I are currently working on over in the

00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:07,069
legs foundation that was a major

00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:09,860
contribution that IBM had originally

00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,219
developed internally in our research and

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,050
our software development team and we put

00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:16,939
that out we made that open source

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,169
because we felt that if it's going to be

00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,749
successful if we're going to have a

00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:23,479
blockchain platform that truly is

00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:26,089
successful it has to transcend any one

00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:28,249
vendor it has to be open source and it

00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,839
has to be under open governance it can't

00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:33,889
be just under the control of the single

00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,589
company Apache Tory patchy system ml a

00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,510
number of other projects open wisk you

00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,069
know where IBM basically took something

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,870
that we had developed internally and

00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:44,990
said you know what this needs to be open

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,740
source and and in many cases we've taken

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,780
these thing

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,770
to Apache and we're very pleased with

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:55,130
the results obviously so I've written a

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:58,190
paper with Todd Moore my colleague we

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:01,040
help sort of shape the strategy from an

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:03,110
open source perspective inside IBM to

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,840
sort of give the perspective of here's

00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,330
IBM's approach to open technology

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,610
primarily around open source right used

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,940
to be that IBM was very much involved in

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,770
sort of helping to shape international

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,430
standards whether that's our ISO or

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,220
organizations like the w3c or Oasis the

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:25,100
ITU and so forth but we've recognized

00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,540
again that open source really one so

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,180
having people sit around conference

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:31,340
tables and developing pros that

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,230
addresses a particular technology domain

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,510
and then having people go off and

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:38,330
independently implement what it says in

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,890
that spec can be very challenging and

00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,860
then you still have the problem of how

00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,390
do you get interoperability if you have

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,280
all these independent implementations

00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,170
people come sometimes they interpret the

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,060
words a little bit differently so we've

00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,000
really taken it upon ourselves to sort

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,220
of say our approach to open technology

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,960
yes standards are important but more

00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,390
importantly we really need to focus on

00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,270
open source implementation so that we

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:04,100
get common code base that we can all

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,990
share and that will help drive

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,540
interoperability and that helps

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,060
eliminate vendor lock-in and again in

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,730
order to achieve that in order to

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,920
achieve that we really need to focus on

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,500
what we believe is important and that's

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,540
open governance we have to be going out

00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,790
and especially for projects that are

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,400
sort of critical they're strategic to an

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:28,730
enterprise those projects need to be on

00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,290
open governance and I say that what is

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,030
open governance mean well basically it

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,460
means that there's no one single vendor

00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,860
that can just willy-nilly change the

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,260
license on you at any time because that

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,720
adds risk right if you're gonna be

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,580
consuming the open source the risk is

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,260
well they change the license they're

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,720
gonna for some commercial terms on me

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,960
and now this offering that I have I have

00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,240
to start paying my Vig to that you know

00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,830
to whoever controls their project that's

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,900
not too cool so maybe I'm not going to

00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,540
go that way and so you're actually

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,779
limiting the ability for you to

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:06,440
have a broad platform if you're gonna

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:07,880
try and sort of control it right you

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,500
know they always say you know if you

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,199
love your kids you let them do what they

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,480
want you let them free right and it's

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:16,670
really the same with software if you

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,430
really want it to be successful you have

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:25,759
to let go you have to let others come in

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:29,300
and contribute to it again I'm going in

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,980
the wrong direction here and again so

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,290
you know from an open governance

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,720
perspective we found that it really does

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,839
yield results right I mean Apache

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,149
started with one project it was it was a

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,610
foundation formed essentially to host a

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,709
single project initially but it is now

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,279
blossomed and what do we have now over

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:51,709
300 projects now Sam I don't that's

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,430
amazing but how did that happen why did

00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:57,259
that happen

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,120
it happened because Apache provides not

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:02,870
just the open governance it's not it's

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,170
almost vendor neutral place but that

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,120
allows people to collaborate together it

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,699
allows them to sort of put aside their

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,279
corporate hat and say I'm just going to

00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:15,949
be put on my collaborative hat and I'm

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,079
going to work even with somebody who

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:21,470
maybe is competing directly with my

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,110
company on even a technology that we may

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,120
share and it's important that we do that

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,889
it's important that we create

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,410
environments where there can be a

00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:33,260
diversity of contributor ship where

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,029
there's no one one company that can sort

00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,790
of willy-nilly change what's going on

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,670
with the license or you know make

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:43,339
technical decisions that adversely

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:46,310
affect others right it really needs to

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:49,519
be a situation where there's a broad

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,740
diverse community around the development

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,810
of that software and it's and there's a

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,399
broad and diverse community that can

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,170
essentially help to make sure that that

00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,949
community that software is sustained

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:04,189
over time again additional risk we've

00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:06,860
had situations where we had sort of

00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:09,560
single vendor software that was very

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,240
popular and where the company that was

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,339
sponsoring it and doing most of the

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,079
development decide

00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:17,709
one day you know what we're not gonna do

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:20,319
that anymore see yeah and they just

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:21,879
closed shop now it's open source you can

00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:23,769
take the code you can do whatever you

00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,170
like with it but if they were doing

00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,850
almost all of the heavy lifting that can

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,730
be presented a problem for the community

00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,410
if they want to continue to develop and

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,300
and and work with that software and

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,999
often that can be a death knell for a

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,220
project so again reducing risk by

00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:41,980
broadening the community making the

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,569
contributor ship diverse not just from a

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,430
company perspective but also from an

00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:47,889
individual perspective is really

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,319
important and so you know we've sound

00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:51,939
that Apache the Linux Foundation the

00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:55,300
same thing it was initially established

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:57,939
as a home for the development of the

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,709
Linux kernel but it is since blossomed

00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,569
and now there's over a hundred different

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,089
collaborative initiatives within the

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:05,620
Linux Foundation and why is that it's

00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,870
because it's a safe place to collaborate

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,699
it's a safe place where people can put

00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,860
aside their corporate interests and they

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:15,160
can collaborate together in a diverse

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,889
manner on open-source same thing with

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,189
Eclipse Eclipse started as a place where

00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:23,079
we're gonna develop the Java IDE

00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:25,569
framework right

00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,009
but now there's projects in Eclipse that

00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:29,649
have nothing to do with Java they have

00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:31,749
nothing to do with IDE s again why is

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:33,429
that how come it was been so successful

00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,230
that it now has like 400 projects at

00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,230
Eclipse well the reason for that is

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,730
because it's a safe place to collaborate

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,339
right people can put aside others

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,350
there's politics yes okay but people can

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,059
put aside their their their interests

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,559
and we've created a very diverse

00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:48,670
community that is sustaining the

00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,279
development of all these different

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:56,170
projects over time and that's the thing

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:59,009
that matters so patchy obviously has you

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,720
know the community over code sort of

00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,370
tended and I think that's that's

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,420
fundamentally important is very

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,300
important in fact there's something

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,360
relevant to Brian and I today going on

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,639
over in hyper ledger about this and it

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,249
really is important that we create

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,679
diverse communities that are sort of

00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:21,129
helping to Shepherd the direction of

00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,929
software development of whatever the

00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:25,120
project is or whatever the community is

00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,810
you know this is fundamentally important

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,550
it's more

00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,710
and then the software itself it's the

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,360
community that you have built around

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,670
that that's really fundamentally

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,860
important and in order to achieve that

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,330
you need diversity not just of corporate

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,630
perspective but again as I mentioned

00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:43,960
also individuals and so this is why I'm

00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:47,230
really happy to announce today that IBM

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,610
is offered to sponsor outreach e at the

00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,080
promoter level on behalf of the ASF

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,670
which really meet what and so who's

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,250
familiar with outreach e I can't see any

00:15:54,670 --> 00:16:00,070
hands but a few people which is good all

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:02,620
right but I'm Ricci again they they they

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:05,290
offer the ability to have people in turn

00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,990
have paid interns to work on free and

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:11,350
open source software for a three-month

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,300
period and so iBM is sponsoring three of

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,310
those interns for on behalf of the

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:18,760
Apache Software Foundation they can take

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,040
advantage of that any time over the

00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,650
course in the next couple of years and

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,220
so again we're really proud to be able

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,630
to do that and that's that's really what

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,230
we're all about here we're really about

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:34,620
helping to improve the diversity of

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:38,830
software development in open-source at

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,660
communities like Apache and finally I'll

00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,870
just sort of give a pitch for some of

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:46,630
the other talks that IBM is hosting here

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,760
at Apache con here they are here and

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:51,670
then of course Sam is gonna follow me a

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,290
think in another half an hour or so with

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,400
the state of the feather so thank you

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,400
very much I appreciate it

00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,690
thank you Chris

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,690
