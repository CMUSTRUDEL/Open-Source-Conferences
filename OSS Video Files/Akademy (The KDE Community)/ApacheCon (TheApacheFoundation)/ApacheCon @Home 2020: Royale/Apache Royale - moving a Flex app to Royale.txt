There are many applications of all sizes that are facing their end-of-life because they were built in Flex presuming the availability of Adobe Flash. Now that browsers are ending their support of Flash, we need to either migrate those apps to Royale or throw away a rich code resource. This sessions steps through the process of migrating an existing Flex application to Royale. It explores how the two platforms are similar and where they diverge, and the tools that are in place to help you get from the dying app to a one with a new life.

Andrew has 15 years in QA and documentation in the software industry and experience building many Flex and Royale applications.
Alina is a participant in the Apache Royale project, and a former staffer at DBIZ Solutions, where she was involved in a major migration from Flex to Royale
