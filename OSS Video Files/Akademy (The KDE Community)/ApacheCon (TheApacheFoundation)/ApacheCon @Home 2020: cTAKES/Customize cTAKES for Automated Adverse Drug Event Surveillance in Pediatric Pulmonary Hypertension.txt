Based on the Apache clinical Text Analysis Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES), an open-source NLP system, we built a customized pipeline and processed 149,038 notes for 984 pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) patients for detecting textual mentions and signs/symptoms that may represent adverse drug events (ADE). Our pipeline featured a customized dictionary for interested term mentions and emphasized term negation, temporality of events, proximity among mentions, for a refined detection for co-occurrence of medications and potential drug effects. Analysis showed our automatic ADE detection system identified up to 7-fold higher ADE rates than those ascertained from diagnostic codes.

[Music]

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,519
a wonderful thank you so much sean

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,560
and thank you everybody for coming to my

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,440
presentation

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,200
my name is chen i'm from the natural

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
language processing lab

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,920
at the computational health informatics

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,079
program at boston children's hospital

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
and today we are going to show you how

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,160
we customize ctex for identifying

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
adverse drug events from the clinical

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,960
notes

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
in pediatric pulmonary hypertension

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
patients

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,199
thank you next slide

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,039
so here we see uh two simple paragraphs

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,719
from the clinical notes in those two

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,680
paragraphs we have uh

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,240
two instance of the same adverse drug

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
events

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
near singapore and we also highlighted

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
the related

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,119
medications in blue

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,080
so we can see in this clinical test we

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,040
not only have

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,479
medications uh and adverse events we

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,759
also have other texts

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,880
other noisy data also other mentions of

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,640
medication

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,920
other mentions of adverse events how to

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,360
our goal is to identify uh so in the

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,079
next slides

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,400
um we want to identify all those related

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,600
pulmonary hypertension medications

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
we want to identify also the adverse

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,960
drug events

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,439
then we need to associate them together

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,920
with some rules

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,880
ah thank you sean uh so the data set we

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,399
are working with

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,000
uh is a pph cohort from our hospital

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,040
it has the 984 patents and also

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,880
for those patients we have a 150k

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,880
uh notes uh the first step is to

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
identify all those medications and

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,000
adverse drug events

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,599
so we'll talk it in detail next slide

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,319
please

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,959
so first of all we are interesting in

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,080
those medications such as cytofield

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,080
the data theo etc and for the adwords

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,760
drug events we are interested in

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,239
rush flashing headache diarrhea etc

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,840
uh the next slide will show so are some

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,080
of the synonyms

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
uh of course some of drugs may have

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,680
their brand name and the drug names

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,840
so there are a lot of synonyms

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
so as you can see our goal is to

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,800
identify all those

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,720
terms in the medical documents as well

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
as their synonyms

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,440
how we gonna do it we're gonna do it

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,360
through uh the ctx dictionary lookup

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,760
so first of all first of all we need to

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,120
build a customize the dictionary

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,879
for this task uh so we have

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,280
three steps to build up this dictionary

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,920
so sean yesterday introduced some new

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
method

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,959
so this project was about two years

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
older

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
so we use some old way to build the

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,599
dictionary so first

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,280
we added a dictionary file

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,720
using this uh type uh separated format

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,239
so cool first then tui then the term

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,120
itself

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
and once we build this uh text-based

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,599
dictionary file

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,720
we can put it under the resources

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,920
folder of ctx

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,040
and then we can modify a xml file

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,080
to let the system know where to look for

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,480
on this dictionary file and

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
on the next slides we show how we can

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,360
modify

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,080
this xmi xml file in three steps

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,000
in xml file we first need to build a

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
build up this dictionary

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,879
we call it a ph custom dictionary and in

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,439
the property key

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,519
we specify where to look for the

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,920
dictionary file

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:15,200
the next step uh next slides please

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,479
i used to build a concept factory in the

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,160
xml file

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,320
we name it ph custom concept and also

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,840
in the property key we also need to

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,840
specify where the dictionary is

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
the next step will be

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,800
associate the concept factory

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,040
to the dictionary file in this xml lines

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
so in this way we can let the system

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
know where to find

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,840
the dictionary file and in those

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
dictionary files

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,560
we list all those interested terms

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,199
we want to extract from our clinical

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,199
documents

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,000
our next slides please uh so uh

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
with the dictionary lookup also we we

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
can now

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,960
let's say we can now find all the terms

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
in the clinical documents

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,880
the next step was uh is to associate all

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
those medications

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
with adverse drug events with our

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,759
handcraft

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,680
rules thank you sean

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,720
and to develop the rule we have 100 plus

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,440
nodes for developing the roles the

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,240
international inter annotator agreement

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,560
for the gold standard annotation is

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,360
about 88 percent

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
and once we uh settle on the rules we

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,960
can apply

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,000
for the rest 150 k notes

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
thank you next slides

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,600
so first thing is that uh

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,360
for some of the adverbs events there are

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,080
no one to be associated

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,199
with all the pulmonary hypertension

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,919
drugs

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,560
but some of the other adverse drug

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,720
events

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,479
are only associated with certain

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
medications

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,400
for example for caesar the physician

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
only interested

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,800
in uh cytofield and the tolada field uh

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,440
same case for joan ball and edema

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,600
so so this is our starting point we need

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
we need to carve the rules so that some

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,039
of the

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
adverse events associated with all the

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,919
medications somehow for them

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,479
or not and then so we have

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
layout these are four categories of

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,319
general rules

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
the first thing is called negation so of

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
course

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,560
some of the term is mentioned but it's

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,919
in the negative form such as the patient

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,240
doesn't have fever

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,240
so this fever doesn't happen so it's not

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,520
be should be counted on

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,360
another thing is called condition so

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,599
many of the times the patient and

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,880
physician are just discussing

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,880
the possibility of using a drug so in

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,759
this sense the drug should not be

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,080
taken into consideration as well so it's

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,800
called

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
conditional the third rule is called

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,759
proximity

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,120
as you can see if some medication is

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,400
mentioned at the beginning of the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
document

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,720
well the adverse drug events is at the

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
end of the document they are too far

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,720
away

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
so they should should not be linked

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
together

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,680
uh the fourth point is called

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,800
temporality a very

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,280
important fact in this project

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,560
as we can see in this example many of

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,599
the medication

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,199
or adverse drug events is mentioned in

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,400
the future tense

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,240
so the patient will switch to a drug

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
so the currently the patient is not on a

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
drug so

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,360
we should not take into consideration in

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,720
the adverse drug event relation

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,440
so these are our four points um

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,840
in order to pick up the tens information

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,879
uh

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,639
for our medication or at abstract events

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,440
we resort to ctex temporal module

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
to be specific we use the doctrine rail

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,199
model

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
for this task doctor rail model stands

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,960
for

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
document creation time relation it

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,639
linked

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,759
every uh events like a medication

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,879
or adverse drug event uh link

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,160
that event accord

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,199
as regard to the document creation time

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
so the act access access shows the

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,880
patient timeline

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,640
a certain point of the timeline a

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,519
document was written

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,599
at the document creation time and based

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
on the tense of the local system

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
sentence we can tell whether an event is

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,240
happen

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,399
in the future such as the future tense

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,519
the patient will return tomorrow

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,399
so return happen after the document

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,440
creation time

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:59,040
it's a future tense and the doctrine

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,640
real value is after for return

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,040
so the present tense has a fever will

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,200
signal uh overlap relation to the

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,320
document creation time

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,440
the past tense the surgery went well

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,519
signals are before related to the

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
documentation time there also a special

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,600
case called

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
before and overlap over time is signaled

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
by the present

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,720
perfect tense has had a fever it means

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
this

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,320
event happened before the difficulty but

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,080
continues through the present

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:37,200
so using doctor model we can

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,880
roughly put every uh events in

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:44,560
our interest into rough temporal bin

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,720
so that we can filter them

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
ah thank you this slide shows all the

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,720
detailed rules

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
uh the first rule would be negation so

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,399
neither the drug

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
or the adverse event should be negated

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,640
uh that's the first rule

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,880
the second rule is the condition so

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,519
neither the drug or the adverse event

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,480
should be

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,160
generic they should not be in discussion

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,959
they should not be potential

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,640
uh they should be actually administered

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
drugs

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,120
and the proximity will require the drug

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,240
and adverse event

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,200
happen within four sentences apart or

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,800
they should be in the same paragraph

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,440
uh temporality for adverse events and

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,279
medication a little bit different so for

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,880
adverse event require

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:36,399
the doctrine rail value to be before

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,440
and or after should not be before or

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,079
after only the present tense only the

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,279
overlap

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,399
and before and overlap case

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,760
uh commit the adverse events

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,000
value them and for many patients we only

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,279
require it to be after

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,079
the the reason is that many times a drug

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,200
is mentioned

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,200
in the past tense but it oftentimes

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,560
means the drug is currently

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,760
administered so the patient uh

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
start the drug two weeks ago uh so which

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,320
means uh

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,800
this patient may still using the drug

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,360
and for adverse events is not the case

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
uh so if a patient has a fever two weeks

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
ago

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
that doesn't mean he has a fever right

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,000
now

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,079
uh so we only have the present uh

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,920
adverse events

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,200
uh thank you sean we can go to the next

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,240
slide uh

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,519
so all those are our general rules

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,959
uh through error analysis we also carved

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,399
some uh detailed rules as this slides

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:46,000
uh present uh some of the our rules

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,240
are uh very clinical uh only the

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,920
physicians understand i still don't

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,800
understand

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,320
and some of the rules are only fit to

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,519
our data

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,160
such as uh some of the medication

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
is mentioned but there is a changed word

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,959
in

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800
the closed vicinity which means this

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:11,360
medication is changed

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:14,720
so it don't take into consideration

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
uh we can leave all the questions to the

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,079
end

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,720
uh so we can go to the next slides maybe

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,600
uh thank you sean so as we can see we

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,639
pick up

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,040
all the medications and the adverse rock

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,200
events but there are multiple mentions

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,399
to link them one by one will be very

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,519
tedious

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,800
so we think it should be better to

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,040
do it as a document level summarization

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,160
so in the document level we summarize

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,000
all the

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,440
unique pairs of medication and adverse

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,519
events

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,519
and we evaluate on the document level

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,480
not the instance level

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,000
in this way we can clean up the data and

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,519
make more accurate

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
prediction so and we develop develop the

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,680
model

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,920
on the 100 plus nodes and once the rule

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,880
is

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,399
satisfying we will apply the rule on the

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,600
rest 150k

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,120
nodes on the next slides we

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,880
can see the model performance on the 100

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,000
plus development set so the trains that

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,399
have a f1 score of 80 percent

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,519
on the development side and test set uh

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,279
we have a

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,920
f1 score of more than 78 percent

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,560
and our collaborating physician think

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,920
this is a very good model

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,199
and so we go ahead and apply this model

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,959
on the rest 150 k

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,560
notes and here are what we find

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,040
so if all a pulmonary hypertension

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,079
patient

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:56,079
only take one medication

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,120
so 86 of the chance it will experience

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,160
he will

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,279
she will experience at least one adverse

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,279
drug event and if a

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,399
patient is taken two or more medications

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,800
under 96 percent of the chance um

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,920
the patient will experience at least one

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,199
adverse

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,079
drug event and among children the most

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,600
common

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:25,040
adverse drug events includes reflux

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,959
diarrhea russian flushing

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,639
hypertension etc in all

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:36,160
using our um ctx based method

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,079
we find seven up to seven fold higher

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,600
prevalence for ades

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,399
than diagnostic codes so c tags really

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,560
help us find more information

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,560
here is a visualization of all the

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,000
adverse drug events per

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,040
medication the vertical axis

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
shows the percentage of patients the

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,240
x-axis

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,959
list all the adverse drug events

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
and the color coded uh all those

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,839
medications

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,639
uh for example let's say the tallest red

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,399
bar

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,839
uh on the left hand side is

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,440
the medication is uh

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,720
um benzene um rb sentence

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:25,279
and uh we can see for this drug about uh

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,959
more than 60 percent of the patient may

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,880
have uh

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:35,360
um may have this uh

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,360
um adverse rock events

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,160
uh edema and for the orange bar on the

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,199
left

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,199
uh it's a sad saginaw field so if a

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,759
patient is on cytofield

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,160
and the more than fifty percent of the

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,160
patient may experience diarrhea

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,279
so this way we can understand all those

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,279
adverse drug events

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,920
uh next slides please and for detailed

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,279
details we can resort to this

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,839
publication

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,839
which just came out this year

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,759
next slide would show us um

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,639
our future work yes uh we want to

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,959
determine

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,360
the capital causal relation between

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,000
drugs and clinical events

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,639
in order to differentiate comorbidities

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,560
from adverse drug events

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,079
the next thing is that this is a

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,320
rule-based system

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,519
we always want to do it in machine

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,199
learning way

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:43,360
so that the model can be more robust

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,000
and portable in order to be portable we

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
also

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,720
are studying on domain adaptation

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,440
methods so that uh the algorithm

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,920
lab developed at our hospital can be

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,360
used

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,560
in other hospitals other institutes

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,279
as well uh

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,560
this is our funding sources and my name

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,640
is chen

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,640
and i'd be open to the questions

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:19,839
thank you jen thank you sean

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:19,839
i will leave the uh slides

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,319
let's see okay

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:33,840
can everyone see the slides at least in

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,840
a minimized window

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,840
okay so we do have some questions lined

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,120
up here

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,080
yeah if i may i can um answer peter's

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,080
question

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,080
uh so the question is were these

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,679
filtration rules applied during the

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,320
concept traction process

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,160
of post ctex in some downstreaming

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,000
functionality looking at the full

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,520
extracted data

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,559
so this filtration the filtration

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,520
rules are applied after the c takes

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,200
did the processing did the terms

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,320
extraction

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,400
and the the c text will extract all the

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,679
terms and store every information

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,799
into xmi files so we did some post

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,000
processing

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,559
uh to filter all those terms apply those

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,919
rules

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:29,840
um let's

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,840
hope i unders answer this question uh

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,880
yes so i just to add a little more

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,840
information

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,919
uh the post-processing filtration

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,520
used for the most part

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,000
the semantic type or tui that came along

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,160
with the

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
medication and

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,200
i think jen in an earlier slide you did

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,200
have a few

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,320
specific uh medications that were

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,360
filtered out by name

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,600
so those were also used yeah yeah

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,640
and another role that was applied in

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,799
general

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,840
uh was the existence within rx norm code

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,160
instead of just for instance a snomed ct

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
code

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,600
what wonderful thank you sean for the uh

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,320
uh for the further explanation

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,320
no problem

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,760
uh if i may i i found thomas question

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
so uh what sentence splitter did you use

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,640
in

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,240
ctx this is a very good question people

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,000
may thought and may think that the

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,520
sentence detection is a solve the

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,320
problem

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,360
but however many of errors are coming

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,000
from sentence

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:59,360
detection um so we tried the default uh

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
ctx sentence detector but it

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,520
didn't have a very good results later on

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,400
we tried uh

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,360
a sentence detector developed by tim

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,360
timothy miller

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,240
maybe tim can chime in for more details

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,679
about his

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,960
uh sentence detector and is

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,600
performed very well and we uh we

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,159
we use it for a lot of downstreaming uh

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,559
process

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,440
yeah it's called the sentence detector

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:35,840
bio tech

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:35,840
bio detector

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,640
oh how did i write engine implement the

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,960
rule

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,960
um

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,240
just a bunch of if else statements will

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,640
make the rule

00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,960
uh in after processing ctek are

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,840
consuming syntax as xmli

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,840
files

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:45,840
uh is it helpful

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:45,840
thank you um

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,240
uh so if i may i can take the chance to

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,080
uh

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:59,280
send cover uh lead developer shawn

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,919
in every project uh sean is my uh last

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,480
resort

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,600
if i have any problem any issue i always

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,960
find sean for

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,360
solution for help and uh he really know

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,679
everything about ctx

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,400
notice that he said last resort

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
uh so sometimes i try to figure it out

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,480
myself

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,039
but i failed many of the times i was

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,039
just kidding

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:40,880
thank you jen for the mention those very

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:43,280
kind of view

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,280
all right

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
um timothy miller really developed many

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,760
uh annotators in syntax

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
maybe tim can talk up something about uh

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,240
his uh

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,240
awesome sentence detector

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,600
i don't know how we would add him as a

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,840
speaker

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,840
but tim if you want to add anything to

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:23,600
the chat

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:26,480
that would be great

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,880
uh thank you peter for uh recognizing we

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,080
are

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,240
we using the temporal attributes uh we

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,360
not only use temporal attributes in this

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,880
project

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,520
but also in some other uh temporal

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,640
sensitivity for projects as well it's

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,919
really helpful

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,440
and the original doctrine rail model is

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,039
developed

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
multiple years ago but it's still

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,200
working right now

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,559
it's based on support vector machine

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,320
right now we are still uh

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,919
we are trying to do some machine

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:05,840
learning based models

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:05,840
uh to do temporal uh recognition

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,840
[Music]

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
this

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
so

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,880
[Music]

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
hmm

00:24:50,480 --> 00:25:00,000
uh thank you gorgana for posting that

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:15,840
doctrine real paper

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:15,840
detector does um

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,159
yes um well so the biggest contribution

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,400
of team sentence detector

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:31,279
is that he fixed uh the the

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,640
the new line characters so oftentimes uh

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,200
the sentence will

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,480
uh the system will think is a new

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
sentence once they

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,919
see a new line character but most of the

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,840
time uh

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,120
the in the clinical documents they are

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:57,840
not the case so

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:57,840
team sentence detector fix that issue

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,720
all right thank you tim for uh

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,520
explaining the

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,679
sentence detector so well uh we surely

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,760
understand that nothing is perfect

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:54,159
and tim's solution is already good

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,159
enough for a lot of downstreaming tasks

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,440
yes and i think i should point out uh

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,360
seatage being modular

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
and lots of different annotators being

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,000
present for it

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,559
et cetera et cetera tim's

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
glad your last comment on missing

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,559
sentence breaks

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,159
there are other annotators that you can

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,039
throw into the pipeline after the

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,960
sentence

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:27,039
detector that will try to

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,039
amend the mistake

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,880
so she takes you know that

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,919
it's not reliance only on the sentence

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,600
detector it's a

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,320
larger system so um you know just having

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,520
a sense

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,520
detector that's not absolutely perfect

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,840
doesn't necessarily make the system

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,840
itself

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,880
problematic i will say exactly

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,919
uh so for this task we only uh

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,080
interesting uh

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,840
medication mentions all the adverse drug

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,919
event mentions

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:13,840
even if it's not in the same sentence

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:13,840
it's okay

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,050
[Music]

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,840
okay so uh we do have a few minutes left

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,559
but before the time runs out i'm just

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,480
going to add

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,679
anything that you think of after this

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,279
time period

00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:50,080
we can you can write uh the dev list

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:52,080
and you know possibly the user list and

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,799
we can always try to answer questions

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,840
later on

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,840
outside this venue

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,840
okay which modules perform best and

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,840
worst

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:13,200
chen i think that might be for you uh

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,720
uh um you mean on this uh pulmonary

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,720
hypertension data source

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,200
uh okay uh so first of all your sentence

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,640
detector definitely works well

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,679
um uh negation negation

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,159
module doesn't work that well uh so we

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,159
have to

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,760
have actual rules to uh detect certain

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,720
uh negated terms um the

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,880
doctrine real value uh the the doctrinal

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,440
model still works are pretty good

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,880
and we can rely on it to detect the

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,039
temporality um

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,039
[Music]

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,760
the

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,600
the generic module also

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,559
didn't perform very well so we have to

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,120
devise some handcraft rules to detect

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,559
some

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,559
generic cases

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,919
as i said uh we tried the polarity

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,440
annotator

00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,640
and uh it doesn't annotate uh all these

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:33,840
negated uh

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,840
cases uh so we tried the neck neck act

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,279
yeah it was a combination of both virgin

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,640
yeah we tried nagas together with some

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,640
other handcraft rules

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,840
very good question

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,159
ah very good question uh the negation

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,559
detection detector may not work so well

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,480
is that any plan to improve the machine

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,679
learning negation detection module in

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,120
ctex

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,200
uh we are working on behind the scene

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,080
and to develop some uh

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,519
machine learning uh deep learning models

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,840
uh for negation

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,720
now we have some new results and

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,519
published

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,799
somewhere um i can try to dig in the

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,320
paper for you

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,440
but we may think about how to um bridge

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,159
the deep learning uh code together with

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,320
ctx

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,399
as the majority of the deep learning

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,840
stuff is done by python

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,000
um that's a bridging question maybe

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,440
china

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,799
maybe sean can chime in

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,039
sure okay so

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,399
i think the second to last presentation

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,320
tomorrow right before

00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,240
uh peter abramovic will be

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,279
uh short it'll be about 10 minutes

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,399
but it will uh be a general overview of

00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,120
how

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,760
one of our colleagues did manage to put

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,159
together

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,159
uh sea takes and the python pipeline

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,640
to as jen said combine the deep learning

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:25,840
with

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:25,840
what you can get out of ctakes as it is

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,480
in sure i guess i'll just give you a

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,679
sneak peek there's a

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,880
library named cassis or cassis depending

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,159
on

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,720
what you like on your dessert and it

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,720
allows

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,799
the xmi that represents the

00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,840
jcas the xml file

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,840
to be read in python

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,960
um

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,159
thank you

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,440
yeah as peter point out there are

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,399
several options to run neural models in

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,240
java

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,679
uh also as tim again writes some uh

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,399
wrapper around our

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,399
java code to bridge into

00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839
python

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,720
i'm trying to dig up uh some of our

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,920
negation

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,040
related publication uh i was trying to

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,240
do the same thing

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,280
i found uh the 2014 by steve wu and

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,680
tim but i couldn't find anything else

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
right away

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,440
oh we uh so tim did you remember

00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,400
our domain adaptation work on the

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,400
negation thing

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,839
okay let me see if i can find it again

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,839
actually here's

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:27,839
let's see

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,839
oh yes uh tim do you remember um

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,880
our domain adaptation work on the

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,880
negation data

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,960
uh i was trying to dig up a reference to

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,280
our newest work on the negotiation

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,560
yeah i think that's the first link i put

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,640
in the chat oh wonderful

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,839
thank you and the second one is the

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,839
negations not solved

00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
wonderful

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,359
okay well this is officially time but

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,200

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,960
compelled to

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,119
