	Secret Engines of Apache cTAKES
Sean Finan

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

The Apache clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) default pipeline is a standard in the natural language processing clinical research community. What is past that standard? While the default clinical pipeline uses almost 20 analysis engines, there are dozens more in various cTAKES modules. We present and discuss the top 5 annotation engines you never knew you had.

Sean Finan is a software developer in the Natural Language Processing lab at Boston Children's Hospital. He has worked with Apache cTAKES for the past 8 years, contributing code and supporting the community.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,279
okay everyone

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,559
uh hello welcome to another presentation

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,160
by me

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,920
i am without moderator for this

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,719
presentation so

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,399
again post questions and comments into

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,559
the chat window

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,520
uh if you have any but then please be

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,719
patient while i scroll up and down

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680
through that chat

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,680
looking for them

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,840
okay well i imagine i'll get started now

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,400
so

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,119
this is about the secret engines of ctas

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
so the default clinical pipeline is what

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,479
most people

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,560
are familiar with uh when it comes to

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,840
seed takes

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,000
what it does is it detects

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
and puts all of the text into a single

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,880
section

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,960
it identifies sentences simple tokens

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,240
parts of speech for words

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,240
chunks multiple words together

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,439
identifies clinical events and

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,560
anatomical

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,560
mentions and it will

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,399
assert uh

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,799
certain attributes of those events such

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,320
as

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,159
uncertainty or negation

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,439
so i presented earlier this morning

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,520
a possible pipeline and

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,159
it contains things like finding the

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,159
location

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,960
and finding co-references

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,879
and if you are only familiar with the

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,440
default clinical pipeline

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,319
you were probably thinking bull punky

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,360
sean

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:20,800
sea takes does not do that but it does

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
okay so there are a lot of other things

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,440
that it can do

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,879
it can detect multiple sections

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,879
it can create paragraph

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,720
splits it can detect lists

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,560
i'm going to tell you what i mean by

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,800
sentences for early 80s documents

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
it can detect degree of relations

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,840
locational relations

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,560
and some of the coolest and most recent

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,560
things

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,599
are temporal events times

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
which cmac just spoke about temporal

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,760
relations

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,720
and co-references

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,319
so i'm only going to speak about a few

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,360
of those but

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,800
they are probably the most

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,800
useful so there are three

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,360
splitting engines that are not in the

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
default clinical pipeline but are really

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,720
useful

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,640
uh the bsv regex sectionizer

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,360
has kind of a goofy name however

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,000
it can annotate document sections

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,640
basically split apart the document

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,879
by detecting section headers using

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,000
regular expressions

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,120
that you put in a bar separated value

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,440
file

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
and when i say you put that's because

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,840
you can make your own

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,440
however one does come by default with c

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,720
takes another is the paragraph

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,840
annotator which can split the document

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,599
into different paragraphs this sounds a

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
little silly but it actually is

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,360
extremely useful in some cases

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
when you need to specify things like all

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,280
right

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,159
a certain adverse event mentioned

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,040
has to be within the same paragraph of

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,920
the medication mentioned

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,879
if not ignore it even if they're in the

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,649
same section

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
or uh the same document

00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:22,479
[Music]

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,040
the sentence annotator or sorry sentence

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,479
detector annotator

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,720
bio or begin inner outer

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
this is useful for documents in which

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,360
new lines may not indicate

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,400
sentence boundaries basically

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,400
you have some clinical documents

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,479
in possibly older emrs possibly

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,080
newer emrs but they were entered by

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,800
someone old school who

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,400
just is used to hitting the carriage

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
return or enter

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,520
but uh key every time they reach the

00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,960
edge of the screen and

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,759
the default sentence detector in c takes

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
will split those apart into different

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
sentences

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
we've got another one that was machine

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,880
learning

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,960
trained model and it will

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,680
instead lock those together

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,320
intelligently

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,880
so the be it sv regular sectionizer like

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
i said

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,759
it can detect and create multiple

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,560
sections within the document

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
on the left you see a document you can

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,880
see headers like

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,800
cchpi ros

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,960
past medical history past surgical

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,800
history etc

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,440
then we can have the sections identified

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,479
and this by the way this is a real

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,120
document

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,840
that you can find in the c-takes

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,160
examples

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,120
module and by real i mean uh

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
it was made by someone who actually is

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,800
familiar with clinical texts and knows

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,280
what they're doing but it is not about a

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
real person

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
okay so on the right it actually split

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
this apart

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,880
into different sections and

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,919
i made a writer that made this a little

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,600
obvious by giving you the section id

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,199
and document text that

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
names of the section followed by the

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,400
actual section test

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
so we can see a section id of history of

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,080
present illness

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,360
that's the normalized section id for

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,960
the document text

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,880
that was actually in the document on the

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,560
left cc

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,759
slash hpi and then the text that was in

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,840
that document

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,520
you can see as you move down in the

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,160
output on the right

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:58,639
it has normalized ids review of systems

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,720
that it gave the document text ros

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
past medical history happens to be the

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,160
same id as

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,360
what was in the document

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,599
etc so this actually does pretty well

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,720
and sometimes these are very important

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,960
to have

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,319
for instance history of present illness

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,440
or past medical history

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,960
you may want to take every mention in

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,240
those sections

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,599
and assign them the

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,280
attribute of historically in the past

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,199
or before the document was written

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,800
whereas something like medications

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,919
which is a section further down the

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,520
document you might want to lean towards

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,599
a temporal existence

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
of current these are medications at the

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,720
same time

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,280
this document was written

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
now i'm mentioning some things that are

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,120
actually

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,280
in a later presentation by jen lin i

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,520
really advise you all to watch it

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,440
uh it's on adverse events and

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,360
medications

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,879
it should be pretty interesting

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,759
okay next is the paragraph annotator

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,840
again this is pretty useful in splitting

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,919
paragraphs

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
on the left you can see the note that we

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,680
had previously

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,719
i modified it a little so that it

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,839
actually had obvious paragraphs

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,200
and on the right you can see where the

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
paragraph annotator

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,839
split things apart split apart the text

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,760
into different paragraphs to a human

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,320
this is obvious

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
to a tool like sea takes this needs to

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
be made

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:56,320
obvious and

00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,320
the sentence detector annotator bio

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,560
again this was uh trained

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,000
by machine learning there's a model that

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,080
is in c takes

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,560
by default it works extremely well so

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:15,760
uh what you see on the left is actually

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,480
again some text in a fake note and what

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,320
you see on the right

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,839
is as is written in blue the default

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,959
sentence detector

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
and how it splits sentences

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,320
so you can see the very first line

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,000
sometimes taking a deep breath

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:38,000
to make more room in her chest helps

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,160
and then it splits a sentence

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,480
and continues with another sentence the

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,600
offending food go down

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,880
the next thing happens uh in the next

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:52,320
red marked box where it

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,839
actually split a true text

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,000
sentence into two sentences as far as

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,640
she takes understands it

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,480
and i marked in red boxes as that

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,320
continues further down

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,640
again this is done because because of an

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,440
either emr method of storing

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,240
a document or just the way that a

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,839
clinician

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:23,440
entered the text

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,240
okay now here is the output from the

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,440
actual sentence detector annotator bio

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,480
it is more of a lumper than a splitter

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,680
in the words of its author and

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,560
you can see with all of the blue boxes

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,600
which correspond directly with the red

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,279
boxes

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,399
that it has correctly lumped together

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,200
these lines of text which have carriage

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,160
return

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,040
you know into a single sentence

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,000
for everything in a pipeline that

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,600
continues

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,399
and requires sentences which is

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,279
really a lot a lot of components depend

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,560
upon

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
sentences being correct this is

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
extremely

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,440
important and

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,640
a lot of people don't know it exists

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
okay so those were some splitting

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,519
engines

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,160
here are three relation engines

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,160
relations are pretty powerful things

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,079
the location of relation extractor

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,839
annotator has

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,720
a ridiculously strong long name but

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,959
it does its job it can annotate the

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,120
locations of signed symptoms disease

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,200
disorders procedures

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:47,120
and you can use those down the line

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,920
the event time relation annotator and

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
a similar one the event event relation

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,279
annotator

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
these annotate temporal relations

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,560
between events and times

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,279
the first one or events and other events

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,279
the second one

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,120
and the mentioned cluster co-reference

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,839
annotator

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,680
this is what gives us the co-references

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,360
between

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,560
two mentions in the text that refer to

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,920
the same real world

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,079
entity okay

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,920
so here are some examples from the

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,880
location of relation extractor annotator

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,240
on the left

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,440
is document text and i

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,839
put into blue boxes some

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,040
locations that again like other things

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,519
they're obvious to

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,839
us but to a computer

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,800
this is something that needs to be put

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,440
together for it

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,360
and that's what the location of relation

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,560
extractor annotator does

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,360
so we can see on the right that it got

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,560
vein ligation located at the saphenous

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,279
vein

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,920
moving down phlebectomy that phlebectomy

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,480
located at the leg moving further down

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,800
dbt

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,000
located at the saphenous vein and the

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,560
right leg

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,560
etc

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:15,040
these are useful things to have

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,120
all right some of our temporal relation

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,680
annotators

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
text on the left what it actually pulled

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
out on the right

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,680
we got complaints today and it says okay

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,519
today contains complaints

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,959
we have history significant for mild

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,519
intermittent asthma

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,320
and it says history contains asthma

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,880
again with

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,800
at this time contains allergies

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,839
i should point out that the event time

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,839
relation annotator

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,120
uses any time expression so today

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,240
it sees as a time expression but if you

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,560
had

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,560
march 13th it will also use that

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,680
so the relations that it actually

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,560
identifies

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,240
as listed in blue below they are before

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,240
after contains an overlaps

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,480
and the mention cluster co-reference

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,480
annotator

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,600
text on the left blue boxes green boxes

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,560
and yellow boxes i use different colors

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,639
uh basically because they're different

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,519
color references

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,120
on the right things that are in chains i

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,560
didn't bother to mark

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,760
all of the text for grd on the left

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
because

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,600
there are six mentions and it would just

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
get too cluttered

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,760
but you can see the blue box on on the

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
left her mother and her mother

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,600
in two different places but the

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,279
co-reference annotator

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,140
recognizes that they're in the same

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,160
chain they're the same thing

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,870
[Music]

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,959
the same with the drug and the same with

00:14:52,870 --> 00:15:00,079
[Music]

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:04,079
disease disorder i suppose okay

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:07,519
so those are i think the six

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,279
most useful annotators that are not in

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,839
the clinical pipeline the default

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,240
clinical pipeline

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,600
and uh most people don't even know that

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,720
they exist

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
some honorable mentions the doctime rail

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
annotator

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
events event relativity to the document

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,320
creation time

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,839
in other words if the document was

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,079
created yesterday

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,079
and there are a few mentions within it

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,160
it will say whether they are before

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,440
or after the time the document was

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
created

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
if the document was created three years

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,959
ago

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,600
it still identifies whether events were

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,279
doc uh

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,279
created before after the same time etc

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,959
the creation of the document it doesn't

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,720
know when the document was written

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,199
but it still tells you important

00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,199
information about the events

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,639
in a temporal manner

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,720
the html text writer

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,160
it could use a lot of improvements but

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:14,800
it saves extracted information at html

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,800
it is good i think for

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,800
creating output that you can pass to

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,600
someone who doesn't want to look at

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,720
formatted

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,560
output with lists and tables

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,199
and uh you know odd looking markup

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,240
instead it has markup in it you know

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,440
webreadable

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,839
file html and anyone can open it

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
and see what is underlined etc

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,759
uh the fire json file reader and file

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,160
json file writer

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,240
another thing people don't know about is

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,320
the

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,560
ctake's ability to use fast healthcare

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,800
interoperability

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,680
resources this is i think the latest

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,639
health level 7 or hl7 standard for

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,959
exchanging information

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,120
and it's kind of nice to be able to use

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,120
it

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:14,400
okay doc hans so now you're you're

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,319
probably wondering to your self uh okay

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
these are all pretty neat but

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,000
i'm not gonna go through and look for

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,000
them and figure out how to add them to a

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,039
pipeline and all that

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
so doc hand it's an installation wizard

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,079
tool

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,400
it's one little jar file you double

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,120
click and it starts up

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,039
it requires java on your machine but it

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,080
does not require subversion

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,480
apache maven or anything else

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,400
it can build you a custom pipeline it

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,480
can build you a docker file or

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,679
a like local binary installation

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,960
the docker file also has a

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,960
demo rest page that you can use

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,840
it is not as functional as

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,960
what will be presented in another talk

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,080
about a c takes rest module but it's

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,320
kind of cute

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,520
the local binary starts the piper file

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,960
submitter gui

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,280
um if you haven't used it

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,400
it's kind of neat if you want more

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,720
information about it

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,080
like a lot of these things uh you can

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,520
find it on the cta's wiki

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,480
so doc hand what does this look like

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,120
all right so it's a wizard start with

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,320
one

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,720
move to two three four and five so

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
number one uh you just select your

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,200
installation type do you want a local

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,080
installation

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,840
or a rest server docker bundle and it's

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,120
not really a rest server it's just a

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,080
docker bundle with a demo rest number

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,919
two you can type

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,840
whatever description you want for your

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,200
pipeline this is going to be

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,039
a comment in your pipeline file

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,480
you'll probably never see it but you

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,120
know could be nice to have

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,360
number three this is probably the most

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,880
important panel

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,200
you get to select your pipeline features

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,360
these are the features i did not name

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,720
them after components

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,440
uh it's easier to read

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,120
sections i want a single section or i

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
want multiple sections

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,080
and go with that as a choice rather than

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,280
the names of the actual uh

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,000
annotator classes

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,520
but as you can see you can get single

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,880
sections multiple sections

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,960
you can split sentences in the different

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,039
ways you want the simple

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,120
which you know may have mistakes or do

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,200
you want to use the bio annotator do you

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,480
want paragraphs or not do you want lists

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,559
or not

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,840
some of these if you click on them it

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,720
will automatically select

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,760
other features for instance

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,480
if you select entities

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,000
it will automatically select tokens you

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,320
have no choice it's just going to get

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,320
those

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
so for this one i added in events times

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,200
those are required for the

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,799
event time annotator event relations

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,400
locations co-references so we have

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,360
basically all of the annotators to get

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,640
different types that i have presented

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,919
throughout this uh

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,679
little talk number four

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,240
pipeline outputs uh you know

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,880
they're different outputs you can do

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,919
fire

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,720
html text properties xmi

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,520
a list of kui's and a run summary is

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,679
just

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,720
something that says you're finished

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,720
here's how long

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,080
it took to initialize here's how long it

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,170
took to process

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,280
each note you know

00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,679
[Music]

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,320
and finally there's this summary tells

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,799
you what you

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
chose for the installation what

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,799
description you wrote

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,000
all of the features that you selected

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,320
and the different

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
pipeline outputs that you selected you

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,880
click finish

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,880
and then you're good to go

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,200
so last the slide with contacts more

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
info

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,559
write questions if not in this chat

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,520
right now

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,600
then write questions comments to the uh

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,960
different

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,840
lists the dev list and user list please

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,480
check our ctx website

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,600
and the most comprehensive information

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,200
right now is on the seats wiki most

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,400
comprehensive

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,000
not completely comprehensive so

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,120
you if you can't find it on the wiki

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,720
write your question on the dev list or

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,200
user list

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,200
that's it

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,480
are there any questions oh good lord

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,360
okay let me know if this is the correct

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,840
chat i guess every talk has a separate

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,840
session

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,840
attendees need to switch i guess

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:20,320
okay i'm going to assume that it is

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,320
okay

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,559
is it possible to have two dictionary

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,400
lookups

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,320
one with window three and another

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,360
looking at a different dictionary with

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,360
window two

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,240
ah right now

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,400
it is not but that's a pretty good

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,039
question what you could do is you could

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,360
create

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,679
one dictionary with the minimum span of

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,640
three for an entry and another

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,559
dictionary

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,559
with a minimum span of two

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,559
however it would definitely be easier to

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,840
specify it somewhere else

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,159
i'll have to think about that good

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,360
question

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,799
are there any uh engines i wish

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:18,960
sea takes had that's a long

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,960
list i think um

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,640
good lord there are a lot of

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,640
preprocessors that i wish you had

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,159
there are a lot of post-processors and

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,159
by that i mean you know

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:38,400
different writers that i wish it had

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,200
uh as far as annotation engines

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,039
there are a lot of things uh i the

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,919
biggest one that's coming to mind right

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,039
now

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,360
is the ability to do word sense

00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,360
disambiguation

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,320
at an intelligent level um

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,559
i think that would really help with name

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
density recognition or event lookup or

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,120
dictionary lookup whatever you want to

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,919
call it

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,039
because oftentimes multiple events or

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,400
mentions are

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,400
found for the same uh

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,640
overlapping annotation in the text and

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:18,080
sometimes they're just ridiculous and

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,080
out of context having a word sense

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,240
disambiguation engine

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:27,279
would really improve a lot of scores

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:33,840
or it would improve accuracy

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,840
of c takes output

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,240
okay doing that has performance issues

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:47,840
from

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:47,840
peter what does that mean

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,039
oh are you ah back to the double

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,279
dictionary

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,080
yes the more dictionaries you add the

00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,240
more

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,960
uh lookups have to be made so that's

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,960
pretty obvious

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,840
let me check the time really quickly

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:29,840
okay we have a lot of time left so

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,840
get creative with your questions

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,840
the world is your oyster oh ask anything

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,840
you want

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,559
though i'm not an expert on cheetahs

00:25:53,039 --> 00:26:00,159
ah doc hand is new

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,919
great so i should have announced this in

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,039
the beginning

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,960
right now we are using

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:14,480
a c takes released version of four

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:17,120
and it is three years old maybe

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,200
and we really need to put out a version

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,840
five release

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,159
if anyone can help us do that please

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,120
volunteer we need testers

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,080
we need documenters uh we need bug

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,919
fixers

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,919
all of that if you can do anything

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,799
you know get active okay

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,440
so doc hand is relatively recent it's

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,320
been in

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,360
uh seats trunk you know the development

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,559
version

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,520
for a few months um

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,919
i have not really made a big deal about

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,559
it

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,880
i haven't you know publicized it at all

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,880
really

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,559
because i didn't want people to start

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,679
using it right away

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,080
and report a bunch of bugs

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,760
it is kind of limited in its

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,880
capabilities

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,080
so i also didn't want people to start

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,320
making a lot of requests

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,320
but

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,760
i hope to make a big deal about it when

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
ctas 5 is released

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,760
because i think it's a useful tool i

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,679
haven't recently found any

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:35,360
bugs um you know

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:38,720
if everyone likes it then

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,720
definitely let me know

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,960
okay has anyone tried to couple wordnet

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,360
heronums

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,240
with lookup as a kind of a better

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
limitizer

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,760
not that i know of but it's very

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,760
possible that someone has

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
if you have if anyone out there has

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,399
please

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,399
you know post something in the chat

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,200
link to github code you know link to a

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,039
publication etc okay what about

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,919
integration of neural models

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,200
and do you like clear tk good lord

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,559
that's loaded

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:31,279
um neural models uh

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:33,840
timothy miller chen lin gargano survova

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,559
post something about that as for clear

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,840
tk

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,840
i'll tell you what um

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,159
i think it's an okay framework upon

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,120
which to build

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,120
uh but i do think that it has some

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,000
shortcomings it has some performance

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,360
issues

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,320
um you know whatever

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,520
i've made wrappers to go around it that

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,679
help with those things but

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,760
okay is there a road map plan for

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,240
implementing transformer based

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,240
ner

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,840
not that i have

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,760
but if anyone else has a plan uh

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,520
post it in the chat and we can try to

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,720
talk about it or

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:28,240
post it on the dev list or user list and

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,080
hopefully ethan you are on one of those

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,080
and we can all take this offline

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,279
okay

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,520
ah okay c takes is a layer

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,760
either above or below uimap how much is

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,640
specific to the clinical domain

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,520
uh all of the machine learning trained

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,039
models

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,559
are specific to the clinical domain

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,360
the dictionary lookup uses

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,840
clinical terms that it gained from the

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,120
umls which is the unified medical

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,919
language system it comes from

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,080
clinical or medical vocabulary such as

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:17,200
rx norm or still mid

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,200
ct or low inc uh so

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,760
really from beginning to end

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,320
not everything is specific to the

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,120
clinical

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,279
domain but uh or if i had to put a

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,039
number at it i'd say about

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,679
75 and really in terms of

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,080
the important annotators probably 90

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,080
percent

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,679
okay

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,520
uh we earlier had discussions about

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,360
implementing patient history

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,880
relationship to a person and named

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,159
entity identification

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,039
and narratives any updates um

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,640
yeah so i think patient history

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,799
relationship to a person

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,880
would be great to have i think that's

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,880
another thing that would be important

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,679
um and should be

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,200
in any list of uh she takes priorities

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:24,159
i'm not sure where it would

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:28,320
lie though um but yes being able to say

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:31,360
uh you know the mother had this disease

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:36,000
and not the actual patient itself

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,320
and she had it whenever um

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,519
you can do that to an extent with ctakes

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,840
right now

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,960
but it i think has not been a major goal

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:49,200
so refinement has not been

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,200
done

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,679
okay uh plans to find a bridge between

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,000
okay

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,039
aha i'm not going to talk about funding

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,039
but um

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,440
funding is always great we need it at

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,360
boston children's hospital the chip

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,240
group but apparently in chip we've

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
talked about

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,440
building a bridge between sea tanks and

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,159
neural libraries and i

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,480
i think maybe that refers to the python

00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,840
neural libraries and i will actually

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,360
talk about a little

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,360
on that on thursday

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,279
uh aha

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,760
is there a more specific answer to where

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,159
we can find a roughly comprehensive list

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,720
of

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,640
engines no

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,320
not at all if you're a developer

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
probably the best thing to do would be

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,519
to go into an ide that can

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,880
search for class names

00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,720
and search for um

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,159
abstract j club was it abstract jks

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:10,399
annotator and once you hit that

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,000
uh look for everything that overrides it

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,919
but that's going to give you a very long

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,120
list and unfortunately some of those

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,320
things have been

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,760
deprecated but not marked as such

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:25,840
so uh really

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,840
it is something that should be done

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,480
okay so uh the last thing in the chat is

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,399
um georgana savova says

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,760
uh if interested she can post in the

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,600
chat links uh

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,200
papers describing and evaluating some of

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,120
the transformer style methods for

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,320
temporal relations

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,360
um this chat is going to close very soon

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,519
however i think those would be

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,039
of interest not just to everyone here

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,200
but everyone that's on the developer

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,760
list so

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,520
that would probably be a good thing to

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,800
post on the developer list

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,800
for posterity

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,399
let's see how much time do i have

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,399
215.

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,000
all right so i'm kind of sort of

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,000
running low on time the truth is i'm

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,599
giving the next presentation

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,480
and we're this not a strange platform i

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,480
would just keep

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,119
this session open uh and keep talking

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,159
but since we apparently have to leave

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,599
this

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,599
go back to the sessions panel

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,680
and click on another thing

00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:03,520
i can't just leave this open and answer

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:06,800
questions forever

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:11,599
but i will remain here for another

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,599
few minutes to answer any final

00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
questions

00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,159
[Music]

00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,550
[Music]

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,800
all right i will try to answer the

00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,839
question of uh

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,640
the possibility to ch save a chat stream

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,680
of a session i do not know of any way to

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,560
do that

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,560
um but i'm not the only person here so

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,520
if anyone else knows

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,520
please post it

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,359
otherwise this is supposedly all being

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,800
recorded

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,599
and hopefully

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,560
this chat will be available on the

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:37,839
recording

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:37,839
later on

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:54,880
okay everybody i'm going to leave and

00:37:50,160 --> 00:38:05,839
enter the next session presentation

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:05,839
okay bye

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,599
