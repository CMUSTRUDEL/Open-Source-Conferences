Description: 
	The Myth of Culture
Ken Coar

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

In today's increasingly connected world, the word "culture" appears in communities a lot. Unfortunately, it's not a single-value term. In many cases the founders of a culture are unaware of how their ideals have morphed, and acquired altered or additional definitions. In this talk I intend to describe some of the factors that contribute to this sort of 'fuzzing' of consensual understanding of the term.

Ken Coar, an open sourcerer and opinionist, has written code for 40+ years. He was one of the founders of The Apache Software Foundation, served on its board of directors for years, and was responsible for the ApacheCon conferences for several years as well. He also served on the board of the Open Source Initiative. Currently he prefers to write code in Ruby, but has contributed to rubygems, CPAN, PHP, and Apache httpd.

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,279
anyway

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,480
what this is about is the myth of

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,559
culture which is a nice catchy phrase

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,559
and um it's

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,760
i call it the myth of culture because

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,120
people regard culture as being

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,079
oh well this culture is good

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
and 10 years they continue to think that

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
it's the same culture and in fact it

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,120
typically is not

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,719
so yeah you know

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
subtitle is why things aren't the way

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
they used to be

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,760
half of my lawn and what you can do

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
about it if it's not too late

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,840
and i'm going to keep an eye on the chat

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,880
for any questions

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,520
which i uh reserve the right to ignore

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,360
at my discretion

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,880
so i gotta click on the right screen

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,680
over here don't i dunk

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,720
yeah what exactly do i mean by culture

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,360
i don't mean this okay

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,280
not that kind of culture talking about

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,439
the kind of culture of people working

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,479
together

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:41,360
so a collection of of beliefs

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,960
ethics behaviors and um

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,680
things that are acceptable and that

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,200
people have expectations of each other

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,200
that a particular group

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,520
has agreed upon consensually now

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,280
consensus means everybody has and if you

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,040
really want to know there's a little

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
little blurb at the bottom saying what

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
consensual means

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
and where it comes from right down to

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,800
the latin

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,520
but i'm not going to uh get into that

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,280
basically

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,440
the the culture for an organization

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,480
is something that everybody has bought

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
into

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,239
okay if they have people haven't bought

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,440
into it well their outliers are not

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,599
really part of the culture so we can

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,080
afford to ignore them

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,080
for now

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,720
i i will welcome questions at any point

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
but uh

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,319
how does a culture form of probably as

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,319
many different ways as there are

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,560
cultures if they've

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,840
whether you're talking about uh the

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,879
culture of a

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,080
community in a village or

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,920
in people in an office or

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,599
people in an organization at a company

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:02,080
or what we're focusing on here is

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,239
mostly organizations

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,440
that people who get together to work on

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
a common project

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,120
such as code or documentation or to do

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,120
games or whatever

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,720
and it let's assume that it grows out of

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,040
the informal ways in which a small group

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
of people actually

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
became comfortable working with each

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,879
other you know they started emailing

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
each other and

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,239
or visiting each other or chatting and

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
over time developed expectations of each

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,720
other like nobody's going to insult each

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,560
other and

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
if you want to make a change to the code

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,440
you know this is this is the way

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,360
everybody does it

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,799
um and um

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,000
so that's that's how it grows

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,200
and they may say

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,200
okay well let's make this formal

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,799
we're going to we are going to treat

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,840
each other with respect

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
our goal is to build this this project

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,959
or

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,959
or whatever and

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,519
don't be evil be excellent to each other

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,120
and unless you're building a toxic

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,160
culture or have a toxic culture

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,280
two of the basic ideas should be uh

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,120
implicitly reciprocal

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,040
trust and respect in other words in

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,479
other words anybody else who

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
shares the culture with you you should

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
respect them because they are a member

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,960
of your culture

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,160
and at least to a certain extent you

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
should trust them for the same reason

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,040
and they should trust you

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
so

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,720
now why is culture a myth the tagline

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
the the clickbait if you will for this

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,600
session

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,160
um is that

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,880
it's it's not really a myth the myth is

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
that

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
uh whatever it started out being uh it

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,919
will remain forever

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,120
you know for instance speaking from

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
personal experience at

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,280
apache we had a small number of people

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
working on the web server and we had

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
the way we did things we kind of called

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,720
the apache way and

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,759
uh we never actually qualified it

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,120
but as apache grew

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,720
for reasons i'll explain shortly

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,400
things didn't quite uh other people

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,919
it wasn't universally shared it was not

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,080
a consensual

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,280
uh culture so uh so the myth is that

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,639
once you set it up

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
it's going to take care of itself

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,360
everybody will abide by it you never

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,960
have to worry about it

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
10 years down the road you can refer to

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,400
it everybody know what you mean

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,639
um not so so we had our small group of

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,160
people from the last slide who

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,160
built their culture they hammered out

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
the details and their comprehensive

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,520
compromises and expectations and how

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,960
they were going to work together

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,880
and what their behaviors were going to

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,160
be um

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,880
and they were happy with it so bingo

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,360
they formed their culture whether they

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,199
they all

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
agreed to live by it they all knew what

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,319
each other meant

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,000
hopefully now what

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,440
threatens such a culture um

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,600
lots of things um but some of the some

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,960
of the big ones

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,240
our growth each of these i'll cover

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,280
separately but you know the the members

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
of the culture

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,720
growing they're being more people added

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,240
uh

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,600
attempts to either diversify it or

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,600
diversity coming through

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,520
who ends up joining the culture

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,120
and of course trying to do

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,120
things like going public or

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
incorporating

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
that can be a threat to a culture again

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
once again

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,599
speaking about the open software sort of

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:03,039
thing um other things that can

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,800
can threaten it is sacrificing control

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,919
over it

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,720
uh or diluting it and

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,639
usually they'll cover also and people

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,240
who are part of the original

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,319
founding group leaving it

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,039
um uh and thereby taking with them their

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,639
their um keepers of the flame

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,720
responsibility

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
or possibly they were going out to lunch

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
and they got run over by a stampede of

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
buses

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,039
so anyway that wisdom the shared wisdom

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,560
is no longer available

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,560
that threatens the culture they've built

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,440
okay why can't growth be a threat

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,479
as new people become part of the group

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,479
they are

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:54,000
basically told here is the culture

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:57,199
um it's this is how we set it up

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,039
this is what you have to live with um

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,479
it said it's been forced the anvil is

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,879
cold uh

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,000
and these new people had no partners

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,120
making

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,039
and it may be completely foreign

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,160
to the background that they have

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,160
for instance um

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,039
somebody coming to work on the web

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,000
server project at apache

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,800
who has a background as an accountant

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
would

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,639
probably find things um very confusing

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,200
and have a complete disconnect

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,159
between his expectations and background

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,039
and experience

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,959
and what the culture was at the at the

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,800
project

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,880
um or someplace that had a

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,240
company that had people that had

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,480
assigned to work on a project

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,760
that had very strict lines of reporting

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,800
and

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,000
rules in place might find

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,120
that coming to work for the project

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,120
put them at a a disadvantage because

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,839
they would have to violate

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,399
the rules that are internal to their

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,839
employer so

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,959
um that's why i think getting bigger

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,279
can be a threat because

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,120
you've got you've got people who are

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,519
coming into the culture

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,160
who don't have the shared background

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,200
with the

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,200
people who created it

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,680
and until until they there's something

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,120
wrong with this water

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:39,519
until they actually

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,560
buy into the culture um they're going to

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,880
be applying their

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,600
unconscious biases which may cause them

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,440
to

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,080
be at odds with what's going on with

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,080
everybody else

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,000
now why can't diversity be a threat uh

00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:01,200
much along the same lines as um growth

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,200
if you have a goal for diversity um

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
you're adding people in order to make

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
the

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
reach some sort of goal like making sure

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
you have 50 of

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,560
of uh

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,800
males and females or you want to have at

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,800
least a representation from

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,320
n different ethnic groups or in

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:29,200
different countries

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,240
but however you define diversity

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:36,240
you can be adding your

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
problems because uh

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,600
there be there may be areas of confusion

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,360
and maybe some areas of resentment you

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,959
know people thinking they're being added

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,480
as tokens um and that

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:55,040
or actually after being after joining

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,079
being treated uh as not as equals

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,079
so it's sort of just

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,480
the social disruptions we're

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,480
experiencing in the united states today

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
you definitely want to avoid that if

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
you're going to be doing anything with

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
diversity

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,120
in your organization and other things

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,880
they might uh

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,440
add that would might be in it

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,120
unanticipated

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,399
um is for instance languages

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,720
um new people coming in may not have

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,560
share the same first language that the

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,519
people already there or the originators

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,519
had so

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:39,120
you have to allow for

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,320
explanations uh and misunderstandings

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,079
and words that mean different things to

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,200
different people

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,480
they may be there there may be

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,160
um social

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,440
backgrounds that you are aware of

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,880
that will affect how things work um

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,000
or ethnic ones or even just um

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,000
plain old time

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:11,440
oh uh let me back up here

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,279
i don't know if i went into any more

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,639
detail on this or not but

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,000
um let's see behavioral

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:24,639
um for instance

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,160
in certain countries uh the

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,000
where i have given presentations and

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,240
i've given hundreds of them

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,240
the

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:43,040
the social norm at a conference

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:46,320
is for questions to be left to the end

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,680
um even if the speaker says anybody have

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,680
any questions

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,079
the people will remain silent and wait

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,279
until the end

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,399
others people will stick up their hands

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,959
or

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,839
ask their questions either when they

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,680
when the speaker

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
says anybody has any questions or

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,880
[Music]

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,959
as things progress unfortunately uh

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,320
you can see me but i can't see you so if

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,320
you've got your hand up too bad

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,639
the temporal issue um

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
i've done a lot of uh writing and

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,680
working on this

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,519
it's we've become accustomed

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,519
to instant gratification

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:37,040
send mail expect an answer um back in

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,240
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,320
i think it was um

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
i was on the phone with i was in

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
massachusetts

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,880
i was on the telephone with a friend in

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,320
washington dc

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,959
and i sent him an email and a few

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,600
minutes later

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,839
we were talking i heard it beep on

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,839
arrival and we were both astonished at

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,920
how fast it got there

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,680
so i earned these white hairs here uh

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,160
nowadays we expect you send

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,160
you expect it to arrive in seconds now

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,399
the way things go the the problem with

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,079
the instant gratification aspect is

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,320
you send the message you don't hear a

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,760
reply you wonder

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
okay why and if it's if it's some

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
contention

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
you find yourself getting worked up and

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
worked up and you send another message

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,959
and there's no right reply to that

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,560
and in very short order it can turn into

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,040
a flame storm

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
when in fact your correspondent is on

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,560
the other side of the planet and is

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,519
currently in bed

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,399
and she's going to wake up and see her

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,160
inbox is

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,199
full of um flames

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,399
and then she's going to get upset and

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
flame right back and of course you're

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,040
asleep at this point so it just goes

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,920
back and forth

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,120
so that's that's another way that

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,480
diversity can cause problems and

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
you need to keep all these things in

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
mind that's why

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,360
um a lot of groups have added you know

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,519
before we make any decisions

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
we've got to wait at least 48 hours to

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,120
allow everybody who is

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
around the world to actually get to a

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,240
computer and see what's going on

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,519
uh or in for some things that are

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,880
um longer view like votes we'll give

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,120
give people a week just in case they're

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,000
off on holiday somewhere

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,079
uh question assuming that diversity is a

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
threat should we expect that in future

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,079
people will rather tend to create

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,040
smaller communities instead of big ones

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:42,160
as it happened for hundreds of years

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,160
well that's um

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,759
as christopher dutt says a threat we're

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,240
talking about a threat to an existing

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,480
culture

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,560
not necessarily fixed but existing um

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,600
there's always it's part of the human

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,240
condition that

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,240
there is

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,000
us and them there is

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,240
those who are us and the others

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,839
now if you remember back to your days in

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,279
in preschool you'll probably

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,040
remember that which side of those you

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,680
might happen to have been on

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,759
uh it's built into us and so um

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,120
correcting making allowances for it and

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,160
correcting it has to be a conscious

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,279
decision

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,800
and we are rational beings

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,000
most of us anyway um and

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,480
we should think about what we do rather

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,399
than

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,880
just doing it without thought because

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:42,160
that's our lizard brain talking

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,160
and lizards tend to fight a lot

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,519
uh if the culture evolves with the

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:51,360
community diversity shouldn't be

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,720
an issue right um yes and no i'll come

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,920
i'll come to that

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,959
that's towards the end any other any

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,959
other questions at this point

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,240
oh all right moving on

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,400
why can't going public be a threat well

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,240
um

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,880
first thing is you know by becoming a

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,760
public publicly traded company

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,400
uh you've basically accepted a new set

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,480
of masters

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,600
you've got government regulators

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,520
and possibly more than one country if

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,400
you've gone public in terms of issuing

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,760
stock you've got the stockholders

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,880
and you've got possibly appointees for

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,679
instance uh

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,559
if you went public and with venture

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
capital your

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,320
venture capitalists are going to want

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,120
seats on your board and they may not

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,160
have the least idea or the least care

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,520
for your culture

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,520
it may be there to make a buck

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,200
and this this can include

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
just incorporating

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,039
and not actually going public you know

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,160
the apache software foundation

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,799
is not a a stock issuing organization

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,120
but it is

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,480
a corporation uh and

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,520
unless it's done carefully uh it's

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,120
there is the potential for interests

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,400
that do not share the cultures

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,360
do not share the culture might end up

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,559
in policy making places uh such as on

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,080
the board and

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,600
start to steer things to their own

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
advantages rather than the advantage of

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
the group

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:43,840
day a questions here

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,080
all right now i can sacrifice and

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,600
control will be a threat

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:56,160
well uh that is another

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,799
um there there

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
the last couple of decades are littered

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,799
with

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,080
um the bodies of uh

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,440
corpses dried up desiccated corpses of

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,799
companies and startups that um

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,240
ended up inadvertently or

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:20,080
forced being forcibly and required to

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,000
sacrifice some of their control um

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,760
for instance again as i mentioned uh

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,120
venture capitalists you got a suit on

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,400
your board you might get you know a

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,720
million dollars

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,760
um and if you want to see an example

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:39,200
of how that

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,160
ruined uh a particularly well thought of

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,679
organization

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,120
um just look up uh

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,880
philip greenspun ars digita and you'll

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,799
get from his perspective

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,960
um what happened he started

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
he started a company it was well thought

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,280
of

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,840
um venture capitalists came in to fund

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,280
them and

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,360
he ended up being thrown out and the

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,080
product was uh

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
product tanked and is a that's a a

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,760
typical story

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,080
i've heard uh many of them that's one

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,760
that sticks out of my mind

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,799
so be careful if you be careful that

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,919
your leaders

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,960
are inculcated and devoted to the

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,400
culture

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,640
and that people who aren't i cannot get

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,840
into a position of leadership

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,200
that's the lesson to be learned from

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,320
this

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,280
i mentioned dilution uh

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,840
what do i mean by that all things i

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
mentioned

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,200
i i mentioned things in the plural i

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,039
mentioned you know behaviors and

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,320
expectations and ethics and

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,559
dilution refers to abiding by the

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,760
the rules of the culture selectively

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,360
rather than wholly

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:04,640
and sometimes um replacing

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:08,080
or adding things that aren't uh

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,200
part of the main understanding or main

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,200
definition of the culture

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,960
this couldn't happen

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,760
i'm unconsciously through expedience you

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,360
know somebody's not here

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,280
we're supposed to run this by i mean

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,799
he's he's in the hospital

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:30,159
so um let's just do it

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,799
and if a person's in the hospital long

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,280
enough

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
then it becomes the norm to just do

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,799
things without

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:43,200
checking with him another way

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,000
is failing to educate those newcomers

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,679
the people who don't

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
have the background in your culture

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,320
they don't know if they don't know what

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,159
the procedures are if they haven't been

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,159
taught them they may

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,080
fill in the blanks themselves and if

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,760
there are enough of them

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,480
they may outnumber the the old timers if

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,760
you will

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,880
and develop a

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,000
new way of doing things that

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,880
is in conflict with the uh the

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,080
cultural norm just because there's so

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
many of them

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,039
you know we had we've had some problems

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
like that uh at apache

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,960
and i'm sure other organizations have

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,000
had it as well

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,880
but um

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,880
diluting is

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,159
as the organizat organization gets

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,240
larger and larger

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,480
um oversight tends not to keep up with

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,039
it

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,520
and so on the outer fringes people are

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,760
joining

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,120
and nobody's really sure the farther

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,559
away you get from the center

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,799
the less uh sure you are that

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,799
the standards of the culture are being

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,120
maintained and everybody's buying into

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,720
the same thing

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,720
so back to that goes back to

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,600
growth being growth and dilution these

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,600
are all tied together

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,400
okay oops okay click on the right right

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,400
screen here

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,840
all right preserving it giving all apos

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,600
and i've only covered a few of them i

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,200
mean you

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,520
left as an exercise to the listener

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,520
slash reader um

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,360
given all all the ways that the culture

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,159
can lose coherency

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,080
consider building in some object some

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,159
some checks and balances

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,919
um for instance when new people come in

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,760
to the to whom the culture is completely

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,880
foreign or even if they're slightly

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,279
aware of it

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,279
don't just educate them give them the

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,640
opportunity to provide feedback and

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,000
listen to them

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,000
they're coming from a different point of

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,720
view um

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,559
so don't assume you're always right they

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,120
may have something to contribute

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,320
that will actually improve uh the

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,039
culture

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,080
so it should not be our way or the

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,600
highway

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,799
thing if somebody comes in and they have

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,960
uh idea how things could

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,799
be better and make things easier for

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,159
them without hurting anybody else

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:19,760
pay attention um

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,640
we're working towards is being inclusive

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,640
not exclusive

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
and you need to get there by and

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,840
consider

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,240
how you can change their attitude so

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,279
they're

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,640
they're not saying okay i'm joining this

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,840
culture

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,840
give them some sort of

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,039
investment in it so they can say this is

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,559
going to be

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,400
my culture and that way they have an

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,200
interest in preserving

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
and defending it

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,640
and make sure that the

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,000
leaders of any internal sub

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,279
organizations are aware

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,320
of what the culture is and they are

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,720
watchable for preserving it within their

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,760
own

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,559
you know bailiwicks so if uh

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,840
for instance at apache we've got uh

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,919
projects and the

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,960
people in the leadership teams of the

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,640
projects

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:22,320
should be aware of what the apache way

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,559
is and ensure that the project

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,559
functions according to it now

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,520
apache way is an interesting thing

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,520
there's a there was a book that

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,600
was going around for a number of years

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,360
at amazon

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,000
called uh the apache way and a number of

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,760
people

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,799
were signed up to write it i was one of

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,840
them uh jim jorgelski was somebody else

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,480
uh and um i don't know if it

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,000
actually got published um but it had

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,360
like half a dozen people signed up to

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,480
author it and

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,440
uh it was very hard to

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,559
to actually codify so i don't know if it

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,840
ever got written

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,840
and that is a problem if you

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,480
it's got to be uh go beyond well

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,279
you'll know it when you see it it's like

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
um

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,120
i don't know good art but i know what i

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,320
like that's not sufficient

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,159
you've got to actually have something

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,559
you can point to and say this

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:27,600
is how the culture works this is not

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,200
and that means listening

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,640
i mentioned listening to newcomers

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
because they have a different

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,559
perspective

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,600
but it also means listening to

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,880
the existing members because

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,440
internet time is very fast and things

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
are changing for everybody all the time

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
and things that work ten years ago

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,960
may not work now which means the culture

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,760
may need to adapt

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,640
so everybody needs to keep an eye on it

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,720
and see wait

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
and watch for ways to improve it watch

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,799
for ways in which is no longer

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,080
applicable or even

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:05,600
obstructs uh the

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:09,120
purpose of the organization

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,120
so everybody is responsible

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,360
for curating the continuation of the

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,960
culture the people who are already there

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,600
new people the leaders everybody needs

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,919
to know it

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
everybody needs to be invested in it and

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,480
everybody

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,919
needs to have the responsibility

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,919
of keeping it intact

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,399
now defending it um

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,480
thomas jefferson wrote the tree of

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,840
liberty must be refreshed from time to

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
time with the blood of patriots and

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,159
tyrants it is its natural

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,799
manure well um

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
that's fine for a country but i don't

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,840
know that

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,799
any startup in silicon valley should

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,960
really

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,120
um adopt this as their

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,559
as their motto maybe some out there who

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,919
actually have but

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,320
um let's uh let's not think about that

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,360
this is a bad year in the united states

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,000
yeah so um

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,640
let's not go that far but we can still

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,720
defend it in other ways

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,120
so as i said ensure that new

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,440
participants become invested

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,960
and become part of the consensus the

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,559
universal agreement

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,000
to accept and go along with whatever the

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,320
culture is

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,080
now how you with them to be invested is

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,000
up to you i've suggested you know

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,399
listening to them i've i didn't suggest

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,600
but

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,159
um showing them how

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,000
things work you know why is the why do

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,360
we do things this way well

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
somebody who's sufficiently educated in

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,159
their culture can say well we do things

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,080
this way it has worked

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,480
as in this example this is how it worked

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,720
this is how it resolved an issue

00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
um if we did it any other way there

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,240
would have been a problem would have

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
gone on

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,039
for years a bug would have gone out

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,919
there and so forth and so on

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
and in fact make sure that any newcomers

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,080
are on board

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,760
with the culture before letting them in

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,200
um it's kind of this might kind of sound

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,760
like you know you're indoctrinating them

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
or

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,880
or initiating them or possibly even

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,720
brainwashing them

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,960
what you're doing is you're mentoring

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,120
the future members

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,440
that are going to comprise the future of

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,919
the organization

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,600
here you're not necessarily making them

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,880
your clones but you're getting them to

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,679
understand what

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,399
hopefully you have under you understand

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,399
and what the

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,760
people who originally formed the culture

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,279
understood

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,200
so you're bringing them along

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,799
making them your apprentice if you will

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,960
so that when the time comes they can

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:59,279
bring along somebody else

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,399
so other ways to defend it well as we've

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,120
uh questioned what would mean admitting

00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,919
the case of an apache project asf

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,840
patrick

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,840
project um

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,039
giving commit access

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,080
probably would be the uh one of the one

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,640
of the bars for

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
admitting they've followed the rules

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,200
they've you know they've

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,320
done things they've done things

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,440
that everybody has been happy with and

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,559
there's been a vote is this person

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,159
um new suitable

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,000
they do things the right way are they

00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,720
gonna they're going to

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,679
maintain our way of doing things if they

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,120
are then

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,399
um you can accept them

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,279
of course if their code is great and

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,480
their attitude sucks um

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,279
then you got a problem you got to

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,279
resolve yourself

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,799
and we have had there there have been

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,559
some cases like that

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,600
uh at the asf

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,360
okay so one of the things where um

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,039
i think asf has not

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
followed through as well as it could

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,679
have with

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,080
this one codify the culture

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,960
write it down publish it make it as

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,440
prominent on your website as possible

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,480
make it detailed especially with regards

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,360
to ethics

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,360
and um you'll get the you

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,960
if necessary you have to get a

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,240
a lawyer to provide some advice so you

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,919
don't uh um

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,519
you don't you don't end up giving legal

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,720
advice that is going to get you in

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,880
trouble

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:51,279
but some things that um

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,279
should be made plain uh

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,519
right up front and here's an example you

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,519
know

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,279
private email messages and that includes

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,960
messages to private lists

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,720
things that you won't find archived

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,440
publicly

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,640
shall not be made shall not be shared

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,640
nor made public

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,320
without the express permission of all

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,440
the correspondence on the original

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,480
message now

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,480
so that's basically to uh

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,200
block now you kind of sounds like you're

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,240
trying to block

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,000
some blowers um but it's possible for a

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,799
whistleblower to identify an issue

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,840
without actually quoting things uh

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,440
hopefully again

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,440
we're not the government and

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,519
we'll be reactive no ad hominem

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,720
attacks you know you if you if you would

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
attack someone

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,960
personally more than end times then your

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,000
email privileges will be suspended or

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,320
whatever

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,200
um that doesn't have to that doesn't

00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,399
have to

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,279
be explicitly part of the cultural

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,640
definition

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,320
but the no personal tax does

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,360
what happens if somebody violates the

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,519
rules that's a separate issue

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,120
yeah now reference this thing frequently

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,640
as i said make it public

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:17,279
uh make everybody aware of it um

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,600
have i don't know remedial training

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,799
once you once if your organization

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
already has a culture and you haven't

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,440
done this stuff

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,559
write it up and

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
make sure that all the current

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,080
participants are on board with it

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,840
you know some companies have

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,360
an annual you know ethics training

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,120
so they have to go through this thing

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,640
and sign off yes i understand all the

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,559
stuff i've taken the test

00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,720
um i will behave ethically um

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,600
i don't know that you need to go that

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,120
far

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,840
but if some that apache there's the uh

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,200
the individual contributor license

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,480
agreement

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,679
and um that i think would everybody

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,440
who's going to have

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,760
commit access to the code has to sign

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,039
one of those and it wouldn't be

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,399
a bad idea

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,040
in my mind if there were a clause thing

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,079
i agree to abide by the apache way as

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,119
specified in

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,800
such and such a location

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,560
we really don't because we don't have

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,639
the location and we don't have that

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,399
in the uh like contributor license

00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,119
agreement but i think it would be a good

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,040
thing

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,079
uh and other people can get there before

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,119
apache does that'd be good

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,000
um and make sure that new people

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,879
again education make sure they're aware

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,399
of

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,480
the cultural this definition

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,320
and what their responsibilities are and

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,159
what their authorities are

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
including calling out violations there

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,079
should be um

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,919
you know somewhere instructions if you

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,679
see somebody violating this what do you

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,200
do

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,839
again not necessarily part of the

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,640
definition in itself but it is part of

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,839
you know the rules and policies that

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,520
you're

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,640
going to need to protect your culture

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,640
you need to have ways to address issues

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,560
to find somewhere otherwise you're

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,880
winging it every time and that can

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,160
well you didn't do it for him at least

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,160
that white lies madness

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,720
now as i uh

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,960
number four here i already mentioned i

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,800
agree to abide by

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,200
put that in there somewhere um

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,320
and the last one i also mentioned what

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,680
do you do with

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,000
um if somebody doesn't

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,470
abide by the the cultural rule somebody

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,960
somebody who does

00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:48,079
[Music]

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,440
publish private email an example or does

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,560
attack somebody personally

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,800
how many times and

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,920
what happens you know we've set out

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,200
those rules they're not part of that

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,800
culture they're part of the

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,800
framework of protection you're building

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
around the culture to maintain it

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,000
and keep it safe

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,440
and basically you want to be easy to

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,960
follow

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:17,920
you don't want to have you know

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,920
something that's so complex that um

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,720
people have to you know continually

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,040
refer to it

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,680
so cultural definitions should be fairly

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,079
small in in scope they should be better

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,800
home

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,200
maybe a couple pages at most personal

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
opinion

00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,680
and that is the end of this presentation

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,240
there are ways you can you can reach me

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,720
and in terms of about me i've been

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,920
writing code for more than 40 years

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,520
i've been using i've been

00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:01,839
part of apache since

00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,839
1990 winter of 1995-96

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,240
as one of the founders of the apache

00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,480
software foundation

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,680
on the board of directors of the open

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,280
source initiative

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,400
i worked for ibm and red hat and

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,240
uh general dynamics and the university

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,000
of massachusetts among other places

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,240
i can't count the number of languages

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,240
i've learned to write in

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,839
but it's been at least a dozen right now

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,880
i mostly use ruby

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,480
and i feel

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,280
very strongly

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:40,480
about this stuff that

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,280
people are building things

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,160
ways of working together without

00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,000
realizing how fragile they are

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,480
um and how susceptible they are to

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,480
subornation or corruption by outside

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,000
influences

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,920
there's always a new project coming up

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,359
with it with a new

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,920
you know subculture or their own unique

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,359
culture

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,440
and um

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,680
i think they're that there are sharks in

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,119
the water that they don't know about

00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,839
so um my point of this is to

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,599
you know say look shark call roy

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,599
scheider

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,960
so anybody have any final questions from

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,839
me anything you think i should have

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,440
covered that i

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,440
didn't or disagreements with what i said

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
i'm going to watch the chat here see if

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,640
anybody says anything diane hardman said

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,200
if it's not reference frequently updated

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,160
and enforced it will die

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:47,839
well either die or become a dead letter

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,839
same thing

00:38:52,079 --> 00:39:00,800
water is supposed to clear your throat

00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:03,520
not joke you

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,160
question does the apache software

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,400
foundation

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,760
monitor project group discussions to

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,079
call out violations

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:18,560
to asf guidelines um

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,800
well the project management committees

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,800
are on the members of the project

00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,880
management committees pmcs

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,520
are on the development mailing lists

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,720
where those group discussions take place

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,760
um

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:39,599
and so in in broad the answer to that

00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,760
should be yes but there are a couple of

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,839
modula to this one is um

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,720
last i saw we don't have any hard and

00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,000
fast asf guidelines

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,000
um and

00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,839
it depends on whether these the

00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,880
pmc all the individuals of the pmc are

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,920
educated in the apache way

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,680
and things have gone on

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,640
so long and things have gotten so big

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,200
that um

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,359
there have been some cases where clearly

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,200
that the the apache way

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,160
got lost in translation and

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,079
uh drastic steps had to be taken you

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,079
know people kicked out or

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,359
um whatever so yes and answer

00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,839
you answered your own question it's up

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,880
to the pmcs to be the monitors for their

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,319
products

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,800
and it's up to the the board

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:43,920
to monitor the projects through the

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,880
quarterly report from the the vice

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,079
presidents

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,640
in charge of the projects of course a

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,400
lot of the

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:55,760
members of the board are on multiple

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,599
uh development mailing lists

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,640
so they should be able to spot it and

00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,480
raise the issue

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,079
again those are discussions that are

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,119
going to happen in private they're gonna

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:07,599
have it on the

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,920
on the project's private mailing list or

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:14,079
on the board's private mailing list

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,079
because you don't um

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,800
put this way you you don't don't talk

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,520
about an active

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,520
investigation

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,240
did i answer your question diane

00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:38,079
yes good anybody else have any questions

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,079
how am i doing sharon

00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,640
so i think this was getting recorded

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,280
which means that somebody is probably

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,319
going to

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,000
try and blow up the background of my uh

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,240
screen here and try and figure out what

00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,839
books are on my shelves over there

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,839
so good luck with that

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,040
i'm waiting for rich or sharon or

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,560
somebody to tell me to

00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,680
to salt off so otherwise i'll continue

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,119
to schmooze and

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,400
answer your questions if anybody else

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,319
has any or suggestions i mean

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,040
did you anybody think of anything that i

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,839
should have included in this slide deck

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,839
that i did not

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,760
another one place where doing this doing

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,440
it this way takes a lot longer than

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,839
it has it it's mixed it takes longer

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,960
for somebody to reply because they're

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,040
typing

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,200
uh on the other hand it goes into hard

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,480
copy whereas if somebody raised their

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,160
hand and said something

00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,400
somebody would have to take notes in

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,520
order to get it to me to put it in

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,520
or i'd have to take notes

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,520
is it a goal for apache to have more

00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,890
diversity

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,040
of participants um

00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,800
[Applause]

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,400
i'm not in a position where i can speak

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,079
for

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,560
uh apache and i assume you're talking

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:23,040
about the asf as a whole

00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:26,319
um i i don't believe that

00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,240
diversity is a goal

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,200
i think um individuals may have that as

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,960
a goal and that

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,240
there are some people that for instance

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,440
try to encourage

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,359
more women to uh join

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,800
but i think the foundation's goal is

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,920
merely to be open so

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:53,680
not be inclusive open

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:55,440
and not discriminatory or exclusive

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,400
what positive changes have i seen to the

00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,319
culture through my years with apache

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,319
to apache culture

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
um

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,359
well i think it has been a force

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,520
i'm not sure considered a change but i

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,960
consider it to have been a

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,000
force for good and demonstrating

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,599
a way that um

00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,000
people can collaborate

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,000
with the original uh original project

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,079
was the web server project

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,400
and we had people from

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:47,680
europe and california and

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,560
elsewhere all around the the us

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,480
who pretty much never saw each other

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,880
they managed to work together

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,880
and they got together at one point minus

00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,560
me and went mountain climbing

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,440
uh which i guess was kind of like a

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,160
a a walkabout hackathon for whatever

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,160
they talked about

00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,880
so i think that it's setting an example

00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,280
and seeing people follow the example i

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,280
think is a positive change

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,280
so i think that asf culture requires

00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,560
some level of age or experience from

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,880
newcomers

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,880
uh

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,520
i'm not sure age or experience is the

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,680
right word let's say

00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,680
uh

00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,640
maturity and um

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:48,079
thoughtfulness and commitment

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:52,319
um people

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:56,880
just as there's uh an age of consent

00:45:52,319 --> 00:46:00,319
because um human brains

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,839
don't spring full-blown

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:06,880
their full capacity and understanding uh

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,680
there it takes a while before people are

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,920
for humans are really ready to take

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,680
responsibility for themselves

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,720
um but uh

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,560
i think that the culture

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:26,240
requires people to understand

00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,040
what is expected of them and i think

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,880
that can come

00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,880
at almost any age

00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:41,520
well understand what is

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,280
expected of them and have the commitment

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,440
to follow through on it let's put that

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,440
way

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:54,480
so a you know i one of these people who

00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:58,560
finished mit at um

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,560
age 12 um

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,119
i wouldn't be sure about because i'm not

00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,359
sure that

00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,359
uh

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,720
well if he's managed to finish mit that

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,800
means he's had the commitment and the

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,319
understanding of the expectations of him

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:25,839
in order to get his coursework done so

00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:25,839
i withdraw that remark

00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:39,839
any other questions

00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:48,160
what are my thoughts on cultures

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,800
built around programming language

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,800
impacting

00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,599
cultural mores built around programming

00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,920
languages

00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,920
impacting the culture uh

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:07,839
which culture do you have one in mind

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:16,000
and you're here you're referring to um

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,839
the cultural more is based on language

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,480
coming into impacting an existing

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:35,839
culture

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:35,839
whoops i think i might need to fix my

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:49,839
uh like coming in with a disdain for

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,839
java um

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,119
well i think people kind of have people

00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,319
can have disdain but they need to have

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,400
tolerance too

00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:10,559
that should be one that's a good one i

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:14,079
should add tolerance to the

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:16,559
to the list for instance um

00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,440
yeah are you calling me out uh

00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,760
deliberately because i don't do java

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,040
i uh i was interested in java when it

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,800
came out but

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,160
uh before i really got into it it turned

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,280
into a religion and i

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,960
backed away slowly avoiding eye contact

00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,040
and i haven't for a long time there

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,240
um you know whatever the problem was

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,760
java was the answer

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:42,880
and that totally hit me wrong

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:47,440
uh so somebody has to sing

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,720
for a language one of

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,920
uh multiple languages that are in use in

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,839
a project

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,720
um fine but let them keep to itself let

00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:01,119
them

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,640
keep it to themselves um

00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,800
they shouldn't be tolerant the people

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,800
who don't share their point of view

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,079
uh if they don't like java they

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,280
shouldn't work on any of the java

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:12,880
projects they shouldn't

00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:16,400
comment on how they're done except at

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,760
a uh a high level that is language

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:21,040
independent

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,559
would be my my thoughts now if they're

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,800
coming into a project where everything

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,440
is

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:29,680
java and they don't like java um

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,680
well

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,400
maybe they're so smart in there

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,880
ten thousand foot evaluations and and

00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,520
architecture

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:50,559
that uh you can put up with their snark

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,559
but um

00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,200
in that case i'd probably

00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,920
uh sequester them into a separate group

00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,839
where the

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,599
all the discussions were at 10 000 feet

00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,720
and not about the actual implementation

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,720
in java

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,880
so that the java snark

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,200
wouldn't reach and annoy the people

00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,160
actually writing the code

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,160
if they wanted to

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,599
opt into that

00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,599
10 000 foot discussion list where there

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,359
is this disdainful chap

00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:26,800
that would have to be opt-in and they'd

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,079
have to know what they're

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,319
getting into it's

00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:33,760
it's all highly situational these are

00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,559
just my thoughts off the top of my head

00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,839
as you can see

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,839
there's not a lot up here

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,480
all this this used to be my hair but it

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:51,839
moved south and gave me a good flossing

00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:51,839
on the way

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,440
so that by the way folks was uh drew

00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,760
folks

00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,760
uh

00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:07,359
you like the lack of filter um

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,760
please explain with a little more

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:14,480
context

00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:19,839
that was from steven snyder oh no hair

00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,839
well this still alters my soup

00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,839
oh anybody else have any comments or

00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
questions

00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,480
unfortunately this uh this platform

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,599
doesn't allow me to see

00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:47,520
who's actually in the session so

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:50,079
i don't know whether the organizers are

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,079
here to

00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,800
tell me when i should

00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:02,160
go away or or what

00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,920
rich sharon

00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,160
dave fisher says thank you you're very

00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,839
welcome i hope that

00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:13,119
uh this has proved

00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:15,760
thoughtful thought-provoking if not

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,280
instructive at the very least i hope it

00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,319
hasn't wasted anybody's time

00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,730
considering it is now 10 minutes of five

00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:23,920
east coast time that's probably

00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:29,839
[Music]

00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,839
time some stomachs are rumbling

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,839
so i guess i'll i'll give this

00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:40,079
uh two more minutes if nobody else say

00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:43,839
anything says anything i'll

00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,839
i'll sign off

00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,079
incubator needs a refresh based on my

00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,680
thoughts

00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,680
um that would be

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,839
the incubator would be an excellent

00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,839
place for a lot of this stuff to happen

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,760
so i don't know how much of it actually

00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:06,000
does happen

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,280
so i'll agree with this sentiment

00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,400
without

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:25,839
having direct knowledge of whether

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:25,839
i agree or not

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:32,960
what really needs is uh some people to

00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,000
write up the the documentation actually

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,119
document what

00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,799
what the expectations and behaviors

00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:44,240
are what

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:46,799
and get buy-in from from everybody

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,680
like a vote on members this is the

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:52,079
codification

00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:55,839
of the apache way

00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,839
ah the tragedy of system d

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,559
i have a ah okay regarding contempt of

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,559
culture

00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,920
i'll have to i'll have to look at that

00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,160
later i have mixed emotions about system

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,440
d

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,520
myself on the one hand it

00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,200
uh i found it useful for tying things

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,240
together and happen in a particular

00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,160
order

00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,319
uh on the other hand it seems to go

00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:24,480
against

00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:29,280
the unixish approach of

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,280
small things working together and

00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:38,319
being more monolithic than otherwise but

00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,319
i have no investment

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,319
all right i will look at that drew thank

00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:51,359
you

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,599
use a contempt culture you mean a

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,720
contempt for culture or a culture of

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,720
contempt for others

00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,559
ah hi gavin

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,240
obviously there's an there's a inside

00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,280
joke there i'm not

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,280
i'm not getting so

00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,079
yeah a culture of contempt um

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:36,400
that seems that seems baked into

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,559
a lot of things um

00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,240
for instance there was a widespread

00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,480
culture of contempt

00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,480
uh

00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,680
not specific to optical organization um

00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:51,359
about

00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:54,640
microsoft microsoft

00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:58,960
does not appear to be quite as universal

00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:03,359
a a target of contempt as it used to be

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,359
so um things change

00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,240
well i found this useful from the the

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,280
feedback i've gotten here so

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:18,240
i need to make some updates to my

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:21,200
slides and find some place to put them

00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:25,359
so i don't have to type them in again

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:29,680
i had this was uh i had

00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:32,480
basically um this presentation was on my

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,119
red hat laptop and my left red hat they

00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,760
kept it

00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:36,720
including the presentation so i had i

00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,240
had i gave this

00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,640
uh at con fu in montreal in 2018

00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,839
so i had to watch the video and create

00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,880
slides

00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,880
from watching the video

00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,839
added a few things

00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,240
you know um

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,160
roy fielding uh made fun of me for being

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,400
worried about y2k

00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,640
so he'll probably make fun of me for

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,760
being concerned about the

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:11,040
evaporation of the cloud and the case of

00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,079
uh

00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,440
emp attacks and he'll probably be just

00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,680
as right as he was before it won't

00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,680
happen

00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,079
okay i'm going to i'm going to call it

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:26,880
quits

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:30,000
so i went from uh since i i started late

00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,680
and i think i probably went late we'll

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,400
call that

00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,119
we'll call that even thank you very much

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,160
for

00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,559
those of you who attended i appreciate

00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,040
your

00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,960
ears and your eyes hope i haven't

00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,079
offended either

00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,079
and um

00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,440
go forth be excellent to each other be

00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,839
productive

00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,839
and

00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:58,079
make a buddy one thing i one thing i am

00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,400
going to throw in here

00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,079
i was with an organization called dicas

00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,000
for many years

00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:09,599
uh and i was approached at the end party

00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,960
uh by somebody who said he was

00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,040
very upset he said he had brought

00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:16,640
somebody to the conference uh

00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,240
to meet people and

00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,480
since i'd been involved for a long time

00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,799
i was basically for gathered with a lot

00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,920
of

00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:28,640
um old timers and

00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:31,680
that woke me up to the fact that um

00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,160
the old timers should go and

00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,720
make a buddy of a new timer mentor

00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,680
people

00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,680
don't just stick amongst yourselves yeah

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,440
that's not in here it's you know

00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,079
not exactly related to cultures just uh

00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,760
well maybe it is i have to think about

00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,760
that

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,839
anyway thanks very much for everybody

00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,200

and then have a good weekend and i hope
