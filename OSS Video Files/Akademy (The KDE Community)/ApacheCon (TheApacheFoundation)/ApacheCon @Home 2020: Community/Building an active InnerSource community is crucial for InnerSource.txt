InnerSource is the use of Apache Way within an organization. it needs both high-level support and internal engineers community support. Sometimes, high-level support is easy to get and implemented, but internal engineers' community support is much hard, it means culture shift. So building one active internal open source community is very important. As OSPO of Baidu, I adopt InnerSource inside Baidu for more than 4 years. I will talk about how I build the internal community in my company, including how I plan, how I implement it. I need to attract the target people, set small tasks to let them participate and contribute, and incentivize them. InnerSource is a long journey, but it is worth the investment.
