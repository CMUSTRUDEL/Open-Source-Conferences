	Welcoming community strengthens the Apache Way
Jarek Potiuk

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

This talk is about making the Apache Airflow a more welcoming community, by applying more of the principles that are the core of Apache Way. This is the story of the changes that we implemented over the last few years as a group of committers and PMCs in Apache Airflow. When our team started to contribute to Apache Airflow, we realized how hard it was to start contributing to the project at the very beginning. While we became few of the most active community members (committers and PMCs) of Apache Airflow, we learned our ropes, but we have not forgotten that others have similar problems and from the very beginning we started to work on making it easier to become the member of the community on many levels. We started from improving the development environment, going through documentation improvements, implementing some best coding practices and CI automation around it, and ending at mentoring and communication guidelines. We would like to share with the other Apache projects some tips and learning on what you can apply to be a more welcoming project. This talk will be half-deep-down technical and half-soft-skills, talking about how both sides are needed in order to be more welcoming. There is a "Success at Apache" blog and Feathercast video about this subject - now is the time to tell some more details in a talk.

After more than 20 years of career in IT from a junior programmer to CTO of 60+ company, Jarek has chosen to continue his path as individual contributor. He got back from the half-technical, half-managerial path he has been following since, and with the vast experience in both technologies and business side of IT, as well as being organizer of 500+ attendees IT conference, Jarek's engineering skills are supplemented by an understanding of people, business, customers and partners, and with the strong understanding that relationships with people are the key to success in either of the roles. Jarek worked in many roles and many types of companies and he tried it all - from few people mobile payment startup, robotics + AI startup where he was a robotics engineer, working at software house as an engineer and Head of Technology, building and leading 60+ software house, Centre of Expertise expert at one of the biggest FMCG companies, and being Tech Lead Manager at Google, and currently - became one of the most active full-time committers and PMC members of one of the most popular Open-Source Workflow Orchestrator for Big Data - Apache Airflow. Jarek is an experienced technical team leader. Loves leading and motivating professional teams of developers, testers, IT admins, project managers, but only if he can actively participate in all of the things his people do. Patient mentor. Focused on achieving realistic deliverables with quality matching the expectations. Balancing well research and pragmatic approach, with a strong flair for innovations. Jarek likes to use his voice and for a good reason.

uh

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,200

committee at abbasi airflow

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,719
uh and also principles of engineering

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,280
polidia you can reach me at portugal

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,320

and uh what's gonna be in the talk so

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,040
first of all i'm gonna

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,880
show you a very short journey about the

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
airflow over the last two years that's

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,680
where i joined the product two years ago

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,119
it's almost like exactly two years now

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
and i will explain what we did for the

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,920
contributors that's the main part of

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,799
what we have done

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,600
but also like the the big part is uh

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
like i've learned

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,680
over the time that doing stuff for the

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,520
contributors making the community more

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,200
welcoming for contributors is not the

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
only thing that we should do the

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,240
community is much bigger than just

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
contributors and this is

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,280
like the second part of the talk that

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,040
i'm going to give so

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
i'll try to explain what the community

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
is and

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
what we have done to make the community

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,680
more welcoming for

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
not only for contributors but also for

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
for for all the other participants all

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,880
the other community members

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,799
uh and like how the apache way plays uh

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
the role in all of that and so first a

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,240
few words about the apache

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
airflow story for those who do not know

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
apache airflow uh yeah

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
it's a platform to programmatically

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,040
alter and schedule and monitor workflows

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,479
we have this beautiful new logo

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,759
uh it's not that new actually

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:14,080
and the story of apache airflow um

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,720
sorry the story of apache air airflow it

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,400
started

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,360
in 2014 when it was uh started in airbnb

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
and it was incubated to apache software

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
foundation in

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,879
in 2016 uh then as you see

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,520
uh like initially the there were a lot

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,760
of commits

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,200
a lot of like uh changes to it after it

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,720
was contributed it faded out a little

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,120
bit and then it started to grow and

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,760
and and grows all the time since then

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,400
and this

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,000
for me it's a sign also also a very

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,959
healthy project that we are we are

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,239
running because like

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,959
we see a lot a lot of uh uh increase in

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
that

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,800
so in 2019 uh aposhiera for graduated to

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
uh uh to the top level project and that

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
was the time of those

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,959
who i was already in the project because

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
like this is my story

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640
in uh with apache airflow i joined uh

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
the project like i started

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,480
my first commit was merged or was

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,440
created 29th of september 2018

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,080
uh then the airflow became a top-level

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
project

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
i became a committee in march then uh

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
then i became a

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,239
google season of doc mentor i will tell

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
about that a little bit later then i

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,360
became a pmc

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
then i became host outreach mentor so a

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,599
lot of the work that i was doing was

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
about

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
making the community more welcoming for

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,000
the contributors

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
uh and this is the biggest part of the

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,599
presentation today

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,720
that i'm gonna give and a little bit

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,400
overview of the

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,319
of what happened there just to give a

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
little bit of kind of where we are right

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,360
now

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,200
so uh when i joined when when i joined

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,200
we it was 1.0

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
version and then we released a number of

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
released uh releases since then

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,840
uh after the top level project all of

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,760
them in the 1.10 range but all the time

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
in the parallel we were also working on

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
airflow to zero version and it's going

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
to

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,519
come very soon uh we planned it for the

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,439
the last quarter of 2020

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
uh in the meantime a lot of things

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,080
happened like we have a new logo we have

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,519
a new site so

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,760
it looks like the the project was

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,280
actually maturing over over the over the

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
week because like we started like simple

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,000
website or simple document site

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,280
now we have we improved our branding we

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,040
added the new site and

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,120
and it's becoming really a major product

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
and with 2.0 we are really targeting to

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,160
be like really really

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,360
major product and make major product

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
and few words before we go further about

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,680
like what the community is because we

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
hear a lot of

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
the words about like community what is

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,320
the community and

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,560
i came to this um uh

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,400
this conclusion uh like no initially

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
when i when i was uh

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
working with their community more like

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,600
contributors only like people who are

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,520
contributing the code but

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
i think communities is more than that

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
generally communities

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
are the people and uh people have some

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,320
motivation so

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
what i tried to do here and that's kind

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,800
of my

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,160
personal view and that like what kind of

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,759
different motivations people

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,000
have when they're contributing we're

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,080
becoming them parts of the community

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,680
and a lot of that was also covered by

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,520
the previous talk on the community track

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,880
track by by mere electrons she was

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,759
talking about economics

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,720
about vendor neutrality and actually she

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,800
she brought up the

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,720
apache airflow as an example it was cool

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,639
but there are like different players in

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
the in this and for me that was really

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,880
interesting to understand like what

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,919
what what are those players and what are

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
these motivations so for the

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
contributors

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,039
most of the contributors are actual

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
users they like to give back to the

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,320
community they build portfolio for their

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
own like reputation or

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,840
whatever status they want to achieve

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
for them open source is really cool and

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,360
some of the contributors get paid for

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
the contributors especially if they

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,039
they have some heavy uh they work for

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,039
some vendors

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,960
and that's like the next stage so like

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,160
there are plenty of a lot of comic

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,759
contributors we have

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
we have much smaller group of

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
maintainers and commuters

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
and they have different motivation than

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,840
regular commuters

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,440
yeah or regular contributors so they are

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,039
usually either heavy users of the

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,160
project or work in the companies that

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,440
are providing some

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,759
products or services for the project

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
uh they often get paid to contribute

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,720
because you

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,639
really need a lot of time in order to

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
become uh committed maintainers you need

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,720
to spend a lot of time so a lot of lot

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,639
of the

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
lots of that time is being paid by

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,319
somebody

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
uh and genuinely genuinely care about

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
the project

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
so they they're really involved

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
emotionally they're really really

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
involved not only

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
because of history but i have also like

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,800
an emotional

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
and often and that's that's my

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,520
experience at least lots of those

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,120
commuters are actually spending their

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,199
own a lot of their own time

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
uh i'm contributing not so they are paid

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
part of the time they do but

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
a lot of the time they are contributing

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,199
on top of that from their own

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
personal time uh and a lot of those

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,000
contributors they do care about the

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,520
software craftsmanship

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
especially the code contributors because

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
they are called commuters because there

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,880
are non-code commuters as well they also

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,400
credible the software craftsmanship but

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,599
i'm i'm focusing more on that on the

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,039
code side

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,120
uh at this time and there are also pmcs

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,400
and from my point of view like the role

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,479
of the pmc is not

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
always about like making decisions daily

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,440
basis in the project uh

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,520
it's more about like caring about the

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,680
apache way

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,280
genuinely care about the project itself

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,880
as well i mean they're

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
they accepted to be pmc's for the

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,680
project and they have some legal

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
responsibility

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
because like this is like the when you

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,440
become pmc and you vote on releases

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
uh you actually have some leader

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
responsibilities

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
and then uh there are also the nice

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,240
thing that i didn't know because before

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,520
i came became an

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,160
uh pmc like the asf identifies

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,160
them from if they follow apache way so

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,919
if you follow the aperture of the pmc

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,840
if then anybody sees uh the project or

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,080
the project or like if you if any harm

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,479
is made the apache software foundation

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,479
takes the

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,319
this is actually pretty cool so is that

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,680
all not really like because

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,160
those are people who create the product

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,240
but community is much more than that

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,879
first of all we have users and they are

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,680
definitely like part of the community

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,840
because and what their motivation is

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
like they want to alter workflows in our

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,720
case they want to execute and operate

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
and airflow is a good

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
fit for them so this is these are the

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,199
motivations of the users

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,839
becoming part of our community uh

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,360
and uh there are also some companies

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,000
that are actually using airflow this is

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
like that

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
like you the airflow for example is like

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
it's a corporate

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,120
or enterprise level product uh used by

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,440
big

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
enterprises and lots of companies are

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
actually using it

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,160
and we have like more than 400 almost

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,200
400 people

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
like companies in the in the wild

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
uh documentation we have who is using

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,920
airflow and those companies they need to

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
orchestrate

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,200
works workflows they need to empower

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,680
their teams

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,279
to how to use the airflow they want to

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,800
avoid vendor locking this is often what

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,440
we hear this is like apaches of the

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,880
product

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
we know it's going to be like it's

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,640
neutral we can it's not

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,399
it's not vendor managed or vendor

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,240
independent it's actually vendor vendor

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,160
neutral

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
and sometimes they have some serious

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,839
principles security principles rules to

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
follow

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,959
and since open source is the world and

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,959
we've

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
learned that open source is being used

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,600
more and more frequently in those

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
enterprises

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
they also care about open source and

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
learn how to use

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,360
open source but also

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
another player and an important one are

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,160
companies from the ecosystem

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,040
so the companies that are actually using

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,360
the airflow for

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
for example as a service they do

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
business with airflow like like my

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
company like we just have

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,240
we are a software house that contributes

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,959
to airflow and our customers are paying

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
us to be

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,120
like to contribute to airflow and be

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,160
good uh citizens and good part of the

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
community

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,200
uh and we want to airflow to grow as

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
those companies they want airflow to

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
grow because they they they make their

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
business on top of that

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,000
then they have to understand open source

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,079
rules and they do

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,760
uh and they are important they want to

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
be important players in the community

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,320
they want to be recognized they

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,600
like they want to be uh present in the

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,640
community

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,560
but also they have some other

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,760
motivations like their vc funding behind

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
or competition they

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,959
they have a little bit different

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,880
motivation like every every

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,720
every group that i was talking ab about

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,959
the they have a little bit different

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,320
motivations and we have to take those

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,120
motivations uh uh into account

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
the uh this is the report like if you

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,680
haven't seen that

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,360
you should definitely take a look at

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
that something that tomak actually

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,880
he's watching the talk here he he draw

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,720
my attention to that there is this

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,640
actual report about open source

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,040
how it plays out in the corporate

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,560
environment and asf is like

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,519
enterprise friendly or or or commercial

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,600
friendly

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,880
and there are lots of companies built on

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,880
top of uh

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,360
or with the next to the the open source

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,360
products

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
and there are some challenges and some

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,320
important stuff

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
they're like what are the motivations

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
what are the problems to solve like

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,000
go and read that and actually that made

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
me think that we have to

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,440
in this presentation that we have to

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,880
talk about that like what is the

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,640
motivations of all those different

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,720
players and also what

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,519
uh what are the uh ways how to make the

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
software the the project we have more

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,440
welcoming to

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,200
everyone in the community to users

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,680
contributors

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,120
committers pmcs the companies using

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
airflow and companies

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,720
who are building ecosystems around their

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,440
full so our community has to be welcome

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,000
to everyone actually this is my this is

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,399
the premise

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,240
and a few words have updated awesome

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
ecosystem so we have astronomer polio

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,920
google cloud

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,279
those are the most the most important

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
players and i think they are very

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,959
important to make the

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
make sure that the project is running

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
that there are

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,720
people who there are some people

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,360
actually are being paid by those

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,079
companies

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
uh who are contributing to the to the to

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,720
to airflow

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,560
and this is great because the airflow

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,279
can grow and and that's fantastic and

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,040
it's great to have this kind of uh these

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,279
players who understand the open source

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
rules and play by the rules so this is

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,200
actually

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
cool now i'm going to talk about this

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,240
more welcome where

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,399
more welcoming community that we have

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,120
done uh for the contributors

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,120
this was my initial understanding that

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,440
making community more welcoming for

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,040
it's making it more welcoming for

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,079
contributors only

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,920
uh if you can read uh uh if you're if

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,079
you read like there is a success

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,519
at apache blog which i wrote about it

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,120
there is a feathercast video

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,680
also recorded with reach uh uh what i

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
was talking about and initially when i

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,120
recorded that that was not not so long

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,639
time ago i thought like yeah this is

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
like this is what we've done like make

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
our community stronger these are the

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,600
parts that

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,519
that i was part of like we make it

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,360
easier to start contributing to our flow

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,000
to understand developer documentation

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,839
we're moving barriers to contribute and

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
increase diversity for contributors this

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
is like that

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,160
that was like my thinking when i joined

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,040
the product and started to understand it

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
that this is

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,120
making the project more welcoming is

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,360
this and how we achieve that

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,560
so this is like where contributors are

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,639
first and fore from like

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,800
the most important part for me and that

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,360
was like biggest part of what i was

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,440
doing

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,440
uh for the last two years in terms of

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,800
this making more community

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,639
uh welcoming so we've done a successful

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
outreach internship so if you know don't

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,760
know altwichi this is they support

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,199
diversity in open source and free

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,519
software they allow

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,800
people who cannot take part usually

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,880
normally with their

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,240
uh to contribute to open sources they

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,040
pay them for the internships

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,079
like in our case that was a project for

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,480
a rest api

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,560
that we have to develop for for our 2-0

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,120
release we have two interns a frying and

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,639
a mire

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,120
frameworks from nigeria america from

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
india together with them we successfully

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
developed the apis

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,760
uh and finally as well and this is

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,920
fantastic like

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,160
again like our communities is great like

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,800
the frank was hired by astronomer at the

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,199
end

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,160
uh and and and that's great result and

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,959
outcome of this

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,760
not only uh good software uh they got

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,320
paid and

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,959
people found work as well that's that's

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,959
that's really great and

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,519
fantastic uh one thing that

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,000
uh i was mostly involved in and i wanted

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,519
to

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,440
like how we made the project more

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
approachable for contributors we

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
developed a contributor development

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
environment

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,120
and the tagline was it's a breeze to

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,040
contribute to airflow so it's called the

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,360
breeze so it's a tool to

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,600
help to start very quickly with

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,839
development of apache airflow

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,000
so literally you set up the development

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,480
environment environment in minutes

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,120
you have a reproducible ci environment

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,120
it's it's

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,959
mainly a glorified bus script without

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
the complete and it uses docker compose

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,920
under the hood so like

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,920
i mean those are technical details uh

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,440
i've recorded a video showing how to use

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,040
it

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,680
as a result of that we have a better

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,160
most faster and more stable ci

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,760
and actually after like one and a half

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,600
years of development it wouldn't

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,199
i was persistent enough to say like this

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,519
is needed this isn't that we need it or

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,839
like

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,360
this is really useful and i implemented

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,040
it gradually

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
uh after a few

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
months or years actually i started to

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
get

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
this kind of feedback from people uh

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,639
like that that's it's truly a breeze to

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,560
start working with airflow it's like

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,320
uh for someone new like it's it's really

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,040
awesome to start with like

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,399
the effort the pool etc so like this is

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,279
like great to hear it from new

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,160
contributors

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,360
uh and even like the last thing that the

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,440
there is a new

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,199
blog post which is just released today

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,720
quickly set up airflow for development

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,240
with bristol before for a new

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,079
new member of the community who started

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,600
contributing contributed something to

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,720
airflow and he wrote a blog post about

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,120
that as well

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,079
how easy it is to start so that was like

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
i think that was really

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,399
really great to make the community more

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,440
welcoming for contributors

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,560
uh we've improved a lot of uh

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,839
our documentation for contributors so

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,480
uh in 2019 20 we've done a lot of work

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
to make

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,079
uh to make the documentation more

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,759
approachable so uh

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,480
we have we were part of google season of

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,800
dogs 2019 i was a mentor there

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,480
together with uh with few other people

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,240
like ash from our community he was

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
another mentor

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
there was like two projects improving

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,839
documentation for contributors and

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,800
improving description for architecture

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,600
done by elena and kartik

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,279
and we've done a lot of improvement

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,839
improvements in our documentation in

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,519
general

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,360
to make it really really more

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,399
approachable for customers and camille

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,639
and caxil

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
they were like great in in contributing

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,160
those in those

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,120
uh those things but not everything looks

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
that good

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,880
or is that good as we wanted it to be so

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,679
we found

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,360
uh uh we found out that like we have a

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,760
really comprehensive documentation but

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,839
it's

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,520
it might be quite a bit overwhelming

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
initially for somebody who wants to be a

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,079
new contributor

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,480
so it looks like the uh

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,600
there is there is there is great talk uh

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,760
by vanessa from

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,120
new contributor uh at airflow summit so

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,280
i invited vanessa to speak at the

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,679
airport signing we were organizing it

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
and she gave a fantastic topic to i

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,160
really encourage you to

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,840
to look at and actually

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,760
there is one like that was very

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,400
difficult to talk to me for me because

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,799
i found out that my way of communicating

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,960
was

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
actually seen as patronizing and that

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,039
was not really

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,320
good experience uh like uh but i've

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
learned a lot that

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,440
actually for people who are new who are

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
coming to the uh

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
um to the community it's much more

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
important to be like

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,640
very welcoming so uh a result of that

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,720
like that

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,320
the best part of the talk from vanessa

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,039
is like a friend of mine camille

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,080
he was like that's his nickname uh his

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,000
his logo his

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,679
uh his avatar elmo so like the vanessa

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,240
was be like elmo because like kanye was

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
like so

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,640
uh empathetic and so really helpful and

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,520
we've learned that like the

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,400
documentation is not always very helpful

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,600
uh and it's like if a lot of that

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,640
documentation is

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,679
uh is important but it also should be

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,799
approachable

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,160
and and finally i mean

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:37,280
some a few weeks ago literally uh

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,600
there was a user who actually said that

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,600
i mean yeah the documentation is a

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
little bit overwhelming for me it's

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,480
great it's fantastic to find it but it's

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
difficult to find it

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,720
and uh he actually uh volunteered to

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
help with that and this is the

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,039
the great thing that we achieved like we

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
have our new users coming to

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
our project and they are saying yeah it

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,440
is a fantastic recommendation

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,960
it needs uh some restructuring to make

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,880
it easier and

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
i think it's the best thing like the

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,640
user who comes and makes the

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,760
documentation easier he's like the

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,520
the kind of best person who can write

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,600
the documentation and we're on the way

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,320
of of improving this documentation in

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
this way

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
but we've also done a number of

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,240
different things with uh we've also uh

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
run some workshops for new contributors

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,440
and that was that was also very

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,120
useful thing to make it welcoming for

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
more contributors so together with tomic

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,160
tomek is listening to the talk i see

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,640
we already run three editions of of uh

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,520
workshops where we invited people to

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,640
um make first contribution to the

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,039
airflow we have

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,039
a format for that we have all the

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,640
materials which we share

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,200
and we are actually actually going to

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,840
run two more workshops in october

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
uh together with the oktoberfest uh so

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,200
we do

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
do it under the hacktoberfest umbrella

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,799
as well

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
uh and and that that was really great to

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
uh uh

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,760
that other people like the same patrick

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,280
who contributed documentation or

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,120
he's going to continue the documentation

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,120
he said yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,640
organize another hacktoberfest event

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,640
after that after getting all the

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,679
materials so it it looks like that

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,720
the whole effort we put there to it it

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,919
really works and

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,480
and and people are uh picking up from

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,080
even like helping others to understand

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,120
our documentation and that's that's

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,960
that's really fantastic but there is

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,559
more there's much more than that

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,240
so i think the the the point that i want

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,280
to make the big point that i want to

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,159
make that the

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,000
big foundation for all these uh making

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,400
things more welcoming and how to make

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,679
the

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,080
uh the the project more welcoming

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
uh is the apache way so the apache way

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,340
is really uh

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,280
the underlying

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,360
[Music]

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,280
rules and principles that we all should

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
take into account and we do like this is

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,760
this is the

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,679
the thing that we are all the time

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,919
trying to apply to our work

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,039
uh you know all this iron authority and

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,400
all the other uh

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,600
all the other uh uh principles that are

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,360
guiding the opportunity and this is

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,840
really the foundation that we build on

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
and

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,200
that helps us to make decisions on

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,000
how we are making the community more

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,640
welcoming

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
uh so so far i mean we were talking

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,799
about contributors

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
so this is the part that i was mostly

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,440
involved in

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,760
but there are also other um other

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
members of the community as i mentioned

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,200
so first of all users like how to make

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,720
the community more welcoming for the

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,080
users because

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,520
it's needed like in order for

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,159
communities to try if you need to have

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,240
users and they have to be engaged

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
uh so what we do like we do better

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,280
performance action camera they're

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,840
working they were working on that

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,039
uh functional dac programming many many

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,640
more new features

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,520
easier dependency management fully

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,480
functional api refreshed ui

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,360
uh and that's an example of a kind of

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,360
modification

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,520
in the ui that we've made now to make it

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,640
more kind of appealing for our users

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,120
we've all done that with the users

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,760
in our thinking like what the users

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,360
might

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:09,840
want to get from uh from airflow to zero

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,039
and it's coming uh it's gonna be really

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,440
great release like

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,159
responding to a lot of features requests

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,480
and and

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,480
asks from our users uh and it's coming

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,480
soon

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
before the end of the year but there is

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
another thing we've done for airflow

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,400
summit

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
for for for our users we've done an

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
airflow summit summit

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,840
also online because of the pandemic it

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,799
was like six thousand that nz's

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,840
attendees 43 talks nine meet ups

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,159
uh from asia europe us and a variety of

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,640
talks mostly targeted for the users

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
and this was also our contribution to uh

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,320
to make the users

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,520
more aware of what other users are doing

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,760
and learn from them

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,960
and this this was a really fantastic

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,520
fantastic way to

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
make our community more welcoming for

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
users because now they can watch all the

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,000
thoughts and see how they can use

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,320
airflow and we have

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,600
the whole playlist on youtube and uh go

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720
and watch if you're interested in

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
airflow because that's that's a

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,360
fantastic learning for everyone

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,280
uh so i'd like to thank here all the

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,159
organizers they are multi pmcs or

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,520
commuters in

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,000
airflow uh in airflow projects and also

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,080
we had

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
pedro and mara from from software guru

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,960
which is an external company that

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,280
organizes the whole event it was

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,120
fantastic and that was really great

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:26,080
uh contribution to our users

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,280
but there is this this famous quote from

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,640
john kennedy

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,400
so i think it's also a right thing to

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,240
ask what the users can do for

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,840
for us so if we are talking about like

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,760
what we're giving to the users it's also

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,600
like what do we get from those users

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,960
as a community as everyone in the

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,080
community

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,520
so we want more engagement from them uh

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,279
like for example the doc improvement

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,480
that i was talking about like from users

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,679
they are the best

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,360
we want uh and those user users can

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,600
be really helpful in that they are

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,760
testing and raising reproducible issues

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,440
uh when the two zero is going to be out

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,640
we are going to need heavy testing by

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,880
the users and then

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,480
we will encourage them a lot to come and

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,480
like tell us like this doesn't work

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,080
this is the problem etc uh

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,919
well yeah we want some users to turn

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,760
into contributors i mean this is this is

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,919
like why contributor workshops are

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,440
mostly also like users of airflow when

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
they're coming they want to become

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,520
contributors and we want that like

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
for small bug fixes contributing on

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,240
features they do or

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,039
improving the documentation this is like

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,120
fantastic contribution that you can make

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,559
but also from users we expect that to be

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,000
sensitive to other community member

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,240
expectations so that to understand

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
that committers all some sometimes do

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,200
not have enough time to respond quickly

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,400
etc but

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,200
i think this is is really like where uh

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,080
the uh the balance is between like what

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,120
we give to the

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,159
to the users and what we get from them

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,279
um so the user is using airflow that's

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,159
the

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,720
that's the second group that i covered

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,720
uh

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,159
but committers what do committers what's

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
the motivation of the

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,799
or what what what what's uh what do we

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,640
do for commuters like to make this more

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,799
welcoming for new commuters as well

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,360
for people who already are commuters or

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,360
are going to become a new commuters

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,799
uh so like we have a big pain like we

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,559
are maintaining 1.10

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,840
right now and that's a big pain for all

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,360
the committers

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,960
and we want to get rid of that by

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,279
introducing 2.0 and

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,000
and introducing like six months uh

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,520
period where

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,200
we will be maintaining it and that's

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,840
gone uh

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,840
for maintenance at least and yeah we

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
want to move to zero as fast as possible

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,240
not faster because we also don't want to

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,120
stress those committers too much

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,559
uh and we like we've introduced a

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,240
introduced a lot of

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,159
actually very cool things for the

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,960
commuters to be able to be

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,640
more happy with the code they create and

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,960
more productive in what they do

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,679
so like we moved from python36 from

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,440
python to three to three six plus only

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,880
uh we've added some automated static

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,960
checks and recommends which

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,480
means that there is less review overhead

00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,120
because a lot of the commits are

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,240
actually

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,279
being verified by uh automatically we

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,919
have a better structure

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,919
nicer easier to read code or better

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,440
documented code as well

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,360
and we removed some duplicated feature

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,480
which is actually great uh because we

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
don't have to maintain those things

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
which are not

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,039
or very rarely used so that's

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,240
that's what we do for for the commuters

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,960
uh what do we do

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,159
for a contributor for for others so

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,320
company

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,320
and also no not this direction so

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,919
companies using airflow

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,520
so i think it's an important

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,840
important piece that we are working on

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,840
right now and contributed some of that

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,679
recently is like addressing more needs

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,000
of enterprise users so our companies

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,960
using airflow are mostly enterprises

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,279
um so we've introduced a lot of things

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,039
like

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,720
uh official docker images they can use

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,240
to build their own images

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,720
official hand charge that we are going

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,200
to release

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,000
sometimes along the 2.0 release most

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,080
likely

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
we have a secure and controlled build of

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,240
those binary packages so this is the

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,600
something that but this is really

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,159
important for some of the enterprise

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,240
users

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,679
they want to be able to uh make sure

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,840
that what they build

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,679
and release internally fits their

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,200
security processes

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,480
uh we want to do a very straightforward

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,480
communication about their

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,039
2.0 like what do you expect when do you

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,000
expect that to zero to be out

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,399
and something that we also think about

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,840
like easy migration to 2.0 so like we

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,000
introduce automated

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,279
checks and and ways how you can

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
automatically verify

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,640
if if you are actually ready to do the

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,240
2.0 migration

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,000
part of it is like backboard packages

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,679
which were released so those blackboard

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,120
packages are the way

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,039
for the uh existing users to migrate to

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
the new way how airflow communicates

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,480
with external world without the

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,679
migrating and migrating to 2.0

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,960
afterwards so we

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,880
bring big part of 2.0 back to the 1.10

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,279
so that they can actually start using it

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,360
before they migrate which makes the mean

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,880
migration much much easier

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,039
an automated upgrade check which i

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,520
mentioned already but also

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,200
uh this is the this goes two ways again

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,279
so what the companies can do

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,880
so the companies can for airflow

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
communities so they can become the part

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,480
of the community and

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,520
more active in it by allowing their

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
people

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,360
to help us which means basically like

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,120
paying for the time

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,679
they spend on contributing this is this

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,720
is really important that people

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,159
who work in companies using airflow that

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,559
actually they

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,640
uh if they contribute they that's that

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,000
they should do it on company time

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,360
many in quite often uh some companies

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
that we know of that they're using

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,760
airflow they're building their own oss

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,880
teams

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,000
uh like com teams inside

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,760
that have focus on oss software or open

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,840
source software and contributing data

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,760
so like define like they change their

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,080
own structure internally to

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,840
be able to both use and contribute at

00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,480
the same time to open first software and

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,279
that's

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,960
that's that's really great i think uh

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,440
some companies have a lot of code

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,399
but they maintain for their own purpose

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,720
and

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,799
contributing that code like recently we

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,679
had them some code from twitter

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,799
from from other companies uh that are

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,919
being contributed

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,600
uh to airflow uh and this is a really

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,399
great contribution those companies can

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,480
can make

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,000
uh yeah they can test and raise issues

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,520
of course and have realistic

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
expectations about like what we are

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,320
going to deliver when and like

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,039
you know uh be sometimes patient waiting

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,159
for

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,559
until uh some features are released

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,480
and again be sensitive to to other

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,559
community members needs motivation like

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,080
expectations because the whole community

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,360
has all the different players

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,799
in place so that's the companies using

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,440
airflow what the pmc is

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,320
uh what do we do for pmc's uh yeah we

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,240
make sure we follow

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,399
the apache way so like this is the the

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,360
kind of like the focus of pmc is like we

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,159
have to

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,279
just it's like big big responsibility of

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,880
pmc's to

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,559
make sure that the the project is

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,679
following apache way

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,240
uh we have some discussions about

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,320
releasing

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,880
releasing the code so just an example of

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
what what i'm working on recently

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,919
and i hope some apache software

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,080
foundation supporting that

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,640
is to get some official asf release

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,080
policy on on binary and convincing

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,159
convenience packages they are a bit

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,279
blurry like how to release docker images

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,080
and hand charts

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,440
is not exactly well uh described and

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,159
reflected in the current release

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
policies but

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,159
i'm i'm trying to help that so that both

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,640
our pmc and

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,440
other pmcs can have more clarity on that

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,120
so i'm

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,960
trying to help on that and start a

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,120
discussion on deaf community

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,760
and propose some update to the policy so

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,520
this is this is the like kind of the the

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,200
make the community more welcoming for

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,120
pmc's also

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
uh and companies from the ecosystem yeah

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,159
so what what do we do

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,640
from those companies we assume all the

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,360
good intentions that the companies have

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,000
that are contributing we make sure that

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,559
the

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,440
2.0 is out quickly and as quickly as we

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,760
can

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,519
this is this is really important we try

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,760
to deliver on the promises we make

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,519
that's not always easy things are

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,760
changing are hectic

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,080
uh in in some in some ways sometimes but

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,200
and in open source software you never

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,240
are sure

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,080
when things are ready but when we uh

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,080
we just try to make sure that we keep

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,279
our promises uh we need to understand

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
the motivation of those

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,519
uh those companies which are trying to

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,559
contribute the code and trying to

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,600
sponsor people who are working on it or

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,399
pay for their time

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,000
uh listen to the plans they have uh so

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,679
that we can also respond to them because

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,600
they are so important to uh

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,279
to keep the the community going and

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,200
yeah so again it works in both

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,640
directions so the companies

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,240
from ecosystem they can do they can

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
allow the people to be fully immersed in

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,919
the community so just you know like be

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,440
part of the community and spend their

00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,600
time on community stuff this is super

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,880
important like those companies that

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,519
that are at the core of the oss uh like

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,279
th

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,039
this is also part of the of the of the

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,000
report that i was showing before the

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,519
access report

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,760
like one of the things that is super

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,320
important like make sure you have people

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,080
that are

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,320
really into the community and working in

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,720
the community and they are part of your

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,640
team

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,960
and let them do the community work not

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,840
only the work that you want to do

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,080
uh the because then it's much more

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,600
valuable for the community as a whole

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,039
uh they should care about all the

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,360
community members so all the different

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,279
groups that i was talking about

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,519
uh provide transparent communication be

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,039
clear about the intentions they have

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,240
and again be sensitive to other

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,399
community members needs motivations and

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,919
expectations

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,919
so that's this is this is all uh

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,200
and and just to summarize this all like

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,799
this is uh this

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,480
uh this all works uh only when

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,840
uh all of this falls in place so like

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,519
everyone motivation everyone's

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,200
motivation is taken into account and

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,480
everyone's

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,679
expectations are uh

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:09,679
are fulfilled and the learning i have

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,200
is that the community overcoat is much

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,720
community over code is important and

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,159
community is much more complex than i

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,760
thought initially so i thought initially

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,120
about community as contributors but

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,720
actually there are many many different

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,240
players they have different motivations

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,720
and different expectations

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,159
and we should cater to two to all of

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
them and it's super complex super

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,240
difficult how to make sure that those

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,200
things

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,640
are are handled well and i think miller

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,240
was talking a lot about the vendor not

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,720
right in the previous talk and

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,880
that's that's part of it so i'm i i

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,360
think that was a really great talk that

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,919
we've heard from from ireland uh and

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,840
importantly it's like the

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,000
very important some important steps so

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,320
like that uh it's important that

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,760
there are diversity in the leadership so

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,039
different people in the leadership they

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,480
have different kind of focus on

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,720
different areas

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,840
so some people are more focused on

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,960
contributors some people are in the

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,640
company some

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,039
on pmcs because it's very difficult to

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,279
focus on all of that at the same time

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,200
and we should be welcoming all of those

00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,000
expectations and all of the motivations

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,000
and all the community

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
members we should have time to all of

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,560
those uh

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,800
uh groups of of community uh and

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,560
abashua is the way how to guide our

00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,119
decisions i think this is this is super

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
important

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,560
like this is a foundation for everything

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,159
that uh

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,399
that makes a successful community

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,480
welcoming project

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,919
okay the question if there are some

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,280
questions how much of an impact do you

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:30,800
think programming languages place in

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,159
driving community contributions will

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,159
appear share probably what it is today

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,879
if we didn't go for example

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,000
i didn't know because like uh abashi

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,000
airflow

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,280
i mean and yes i think it influences it

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,960
and i think uh

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,200
it does influence the direction

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,839
especially like in case of airflow

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,280
uh python was chosen as a data science

00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,320
language and it's great that it's like

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,399
all python

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,159
this is the main main driver factor like

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,760
everything in airflow is python and this

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,280
is super important for the community of

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
data scientists

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,040
did you face any problems of existing

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,440
commuters not being available to mentor

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
help

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,880
out new contributors for example tickets

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,839
without review feedback for a long time

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,960
components

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,800
how did you improve that low bus factor

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,560
uh oh that's a very good questions uh

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,400
like every community probably we do face

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,320
it from time to time we try to

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,359
uh work our or try to

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,880
provide this kind of like workshops and

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,839
training for new contributors telling

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
them how to

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,200
make sure that the contribution they

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,760
make are valuable and they are

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,520
quickly going through because that's

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,240
also that's important

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,800
to know how how the whole community

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,280
plays

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,400
we do have uh some areas which needs

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,599
more kind of

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,200
uh spread out expertise and help

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,720
that's for sure that's something that we

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,760
are continuously working on

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,079
it's rather difficult to uh

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,680
to pinpoint uh specific examples and

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,560
find um

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,560
a good uh

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,320
a good good answer how to exactly do

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,359
that

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,760
uh but uh um i

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,280
i think what one thing that we've done

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,800
and that's that's an important thing and

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,320
that's something that came with a friend

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,880
of mine i was talking about introduced

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,160
like

00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,839
we actually invite a lot people to

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,240
solve the problem by themselves and we

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,000
help them and i think that helps a lot

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,280
rather than them like coming with a

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,720
problem

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
and somebody else some comes with a

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,760
solution but somebody who comes with the

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,880
problem comes with the solution as well

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,200
and we are guiding them

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,359
uh along the way because then those

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,520
people turn into experts as well

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,800
and this this actually helps and we we

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,280
are trying to build

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,720
uh the place in our slack space

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,400
troubleshooting is like this

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,480
place where where people are helping

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,960
each other and this is this is actually

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,280
the the best way how you can

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,880
build the knowledge base uh among the

00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,560
users so that they are asking questions

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,040
get answers and then they answer other

00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,119
people's

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,839
questions similar to that i think this

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,839
is the important one

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,320
to know if uh would be interesting to

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,599
know if kovitt has increased decreased

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,839
community contribution in any way um

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,800
i haven't checked that i it's very very

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,960
hard to say

00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,640
myself i i will start i started

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,359
contributing more that's for sure

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,640
because i uh i spent more time sitting

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,359
in front of a computer

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,320
basically um what are the days for the

00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,839
contributor workshops in october

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,599
they are being announced and i think

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,079
it's going to be uh i don't know if

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,880
stomach

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,960
remembers it's going to be 17 in front

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,160
thank you thomas yes thanks for that

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
uh yeah so

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,960
we are going to announce them fairly

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,040
soon

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,000
okay any more questions i think uh

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,680
i have we have three more minutes i i

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,359
try to rush a little bit through some of

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,560
those slides i prefer to leave too many

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,599
of them

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,599
uh i hope i made my so

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,880
there's just just to summarize uh one

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,839
more thing

00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,320
on the on this though so the the final

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,359
thought that

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,640
i have like i really started uh

00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,440
the journey and and was going through

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,040
the journey of

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,800
open source with thinking about like

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,000
mostly about contributors being part of

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,440
the community

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,560
but actually the the users and different

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,880
kinds of users

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,280
uh or commuters and pmcs they are also

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,760
like their expectations and their values

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,000
and their

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,240
uh motivations are super important and

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,119
like it's it's it's very easy to forget

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,480
about

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,400
those other community members

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
and it's easy very difficult to make

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,000
sure that

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,800
like by one person to address all the

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,640
needs but if we have different

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
kind of people that address all those

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,400
different kinds of

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
contributors we have or sorry community

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,640
members we have

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,680
and each of them focuses on a different

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,760
area

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,040
that makes that can make our life much

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,599
easier and especially if

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,560
the others are understanding that the

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,320
other part

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,160
or the other community members are also

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,880
important and let them

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,160
uh you know be addressed by the other

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
people i think this is this is the

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,880
learning i have that

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,720
it's sometimes very difficult to

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,960
understand that if you have your focus

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,119
on your part and you don't see the other

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,960
uh it's it's sometimes difficult to

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,000
accept someone's decisions

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,280
but if you do accept that okay let this

00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,480
person do the work

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,960
uh that might have a great result

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,240
because

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,599
this way you can address all the

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:26,079
different needs by all the different

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,599
kinds of community members

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,280
should a project use a mailing list from

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,359
the beginning i

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,040
think so like for the apache software

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,920
foundation it's super important

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,440
uh to have uh public communication and

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,720
devilish is a very good thing

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,520
for for that although i think devlius

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,960
has some

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,880
some limits in the way who is

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,200
contributing uh so being able to

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,440
contribute in other places like slack

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,440
and

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,359
uh like discussions on github or issues

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
github issues is also super important

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,640
and

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,520
uh but but but yeah i do agree that like

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,760
bringing

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
the decisions back to the to the death

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,960
list is super important for

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,839
um uh for the project to to be like open

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
and transparent

00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,040
so that everyone can see what's going on

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,839
everyone can

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,280
can participate in that if needed and

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,520
those decisions are

00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,680
captured the decisions are captured even

00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,760
if they are taken somewhere outside

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,680
sometimes that they should be brought in

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,280
and and and discussed there

00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,720
so i think it's super important for

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,920
apache software products to be on the

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,720
death list from the

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,720
from the day one

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,960
all right i think the

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
time is up thank you very much i hope

00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,960
you enjoyed it and thank you for the

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,119
opportunity of speaking at the

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,440
apache con to all the apache con

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,839
organizers that was really great

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,880
uh that i could do that after last year

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,880
visiting apache con berlin uh

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,480
this is my first time when i'm speaking

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,880
at the main stage

00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:07,839
that was really good great opportunity

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:07,839
