Open source sustainability is more than just individuals figuring out how to make a living off of open source. Have you ever wondered who actually pays for open source? ### Abstract Open source sustainability is more than just individuals figuring out how to make a living off of open source. Have you ever wondered who actually pays for open source? Not just developers, but the whole ecosystem around major open source projects, either at a FOSS Foundation, independent or an open core project at a company? The major software projects we all rely on are mostly hosted at Foundations like Apache, Eclipse, Linux, or Software Freedom Conservancy. Those foundations provide a wide variety of support to project communities, including legal and licensing assistance, trademark management, event support, and more. As non-profits, these foundations rely on donors and sponsors for all of their work. So who pays for all of this critical support for open source foundations? Come find out what companies are behind the popular open source foundations and major independent projects, and who's actually paying for all of the other support work that's done to keep the servers running, press releases coming, and license compliance work. Surprises are guaranteed; I know I was surprised when I realized how many different FOSS projects that Microsoft is an annual sponsor for, and what projects a few other companies supported with their cash.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,439
okay

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
so this session is in the community

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,880
track at apachecon

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,320
my name is shane kirkerew i uh started a

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,760
consulting company to

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,760
help tell people about how open source

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
really works called punderthings

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,760
and we're going to explore who pays for

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,760
foss foundations for

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,160
who pays for open source sort of behind

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
the scenes and how do organizations like

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,960
the apache software foundation

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039
get their funding so

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
what does that actually mean who pays

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,280
for open source foundations

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
now we don't pay for open source we can

00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
just use it for free this talk is really

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,000
about

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,199
all the ways that open source both

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
projects

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
and products and communities actually

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,840
build

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,400
the software right so the way we might

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
pay to build it that we want to

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,560
but we should really have some more

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,320
definition so i want to quickly cover

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,000
um what what is open source i hope we

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,680
all know that just to be clear

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
how do you pay for it or rather the

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,560
different ways we we can contribute

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
to making projects work um whether it's

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,360
code or services or testing or

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,079
documentation

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
okay documentation uh and then we'll go

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,240
into the interesting part

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,439
of how some major foundations actually

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,720
get funded and

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
what their funding levels are and where

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,960
it comes from

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
so what does open source mean so just to

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
be clear

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,439
open source is software code that's

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
publicly available

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,799
that is under an osi approved license

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,320
under the ost their definition is here

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,840
okay hopefully we all understand that

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
here at

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,399
and we also understand in apache that

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,399
that's not really the important part

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,560
of a project it's greatest that open

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
source license but who is managing the

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
project

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,640
how do they manage new contributions do

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
they welcome

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
new contributions from anyone how do

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,280
they get other support they have

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
infrastructure for builds

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,720
things like that when you're a small

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,560
independent open source project you

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
might be able to run out of your garage

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
but when you get to a bigger scale you

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,959
need support of a foundation

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,080
or of someone to help with all the other

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,000
things besides just writing code

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
so what does that mean and who are we

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,640
talking about

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,959
um because this is when i talk to

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,640
different people about this kind of talk

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,920
they have totally different viewpoints

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,400
whether they're thinking as

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
a corporate employee or vice president

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,720
of finance

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,080
or just a user who's curious about this

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,200
well let's break it down a little bit in

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,959
terms of

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,000
individuals versus organizations so

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,480
we all as users can contribute work by

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
doing testing or submitting bugs we have

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
lots of contributors at apache who we

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,120
love

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
who actually submit the fixes or maybe

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,760
make a new documentation in different

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
language

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
and of course committers and maintainers

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,360
or pmc members who are

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
the individuals working on a project and

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,239
we know who they are because

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,400
they're all people like us what is

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,519
a different way to look at it is

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
organizations

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,840
can contribute work or funding so

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,120
commercial companies is of course a big

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,480
topic that we always

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,480
think about and we are like who's behind

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,080
which project uh governments

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
in europe in particular as opposed to

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
the us there are plenty of

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
uh grants for different open source

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
related projects whether it's to a

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
project directly or to a company that's

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,720
working on a project

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
and of course all everybody and everyone

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,920
in research and academia

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,680
we actually have another talk coming up

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
after this of an experience of

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
someone from an academic background but

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
who's really embracing open source so

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,040
that'll be interesting to see too

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
so a good question is who does the most

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,920
work in open source projects well we'll

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,200
talk about that a little bit in a minute

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
this is a different this is a way of

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,319
looking at the

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
things we do not necessarily who it is

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,000
but what we do whether

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
we put in effort which is we're all

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,959
familiar with that whether we're putting

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
in pull requests or

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
we're providing support on a mailing

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
list right that's super helpful

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,239
for project committers if other users

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,120
can help other users answer their

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,479
questions or

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
or make them better um or creating a new

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,120
project that you want to bring to a

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,479
foundation or you run to bring to the

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
next level

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,600
and of course on the other side we have

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,280
funding right this is

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
rarely coming from individuals mostly

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,600
from corporations sometimes from

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
governments

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
um whether it's sponsoring a foundation

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
or project helping run events

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,240
because those are really hard to run

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,759
without some sort of infrastructure and

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,720
money behind them

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,560
providing how cloud hosting and so on

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,280
and the big one which is the bottom here

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,400
is paying employees to do work

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,360
so these are all different ways that

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,919
someone can help

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
pay to build open source whether or not

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,320
it's directly money

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,440
and money keeps coming up in a lot of

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
different topics and

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,639
my theory is that um the money is not as

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,560
important as the community certainly

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,320
the contributions themselves are what's

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,080
important to the projects

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,880
but on a bigger scale um

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,240
the way those contributions come to us

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,759
are most often

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,080
from corporations so all the

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
funding for the services and so on uh

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,440
that kind of obscures the fact that

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
many of our committers at apache and

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,680
other organizations uh

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
are actually just paid open source i

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
mean paid developers at software vendors

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
or

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
non-software vendors in a lot of cases

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,520
um where effectively the company is

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
is bankrolling most of their work uh so

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,120
let's actually look at some data instead

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,479
of just listening to me uh opined about

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
these ideas so

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,520
where does open source come from well

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,720
the linux kernel development

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,520
um has a long history and they have

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,960
tracked which companies are sponsoring

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
work so they've tracked every single

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,240
commit and then

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,000
they can in that small enough realm they

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
can see who works for what company

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
during what year

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
and then track what is done as

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,039
essentially an employee and what is done

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,319
as a volunteer well in 2018

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,039
85 of all code in the linux kernel was

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,720
paid corporate work that is they're

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,360
almost sure that as directly as

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
some company investing by having their

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,680
employee do the work

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,639
and if we look back in history uh that's

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,360
been a pretty

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,600
steady slow and steady increase from

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
2010 it was 70

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
as linux scales it's sort of hard to get

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
into

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,479
doing the development unless you have

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,280
the experience and the time

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,360
to do it so that's a huge factor of what

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
actually drives linux kernel development

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,720
if we look at apache back in 2016 we did

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,120
a survey that had a very clear question

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,880
how what time were you spending

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,759
contributing code to your projects at

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,319
apache

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,800
and at the time about 50 percent replied

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,840
that it was

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,800
as employee as their job so

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
half of all apache committers were doing

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,479
their work

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,759
as a job uh we've done another survey

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
recently which has a slightly different

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,479
question

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,960
but the numbers are similar about half

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,360
is done as directly paid work

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,479
and of course the other half may be paid

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,039
by a consultant

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,160
or maybe um part during their day and

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,199
part during the evening we're not quite

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,880
sure

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,639
but there's a clear trend here and if we

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,479
go go over to drupal

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
drupal has a great system in their

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,720
commit logs where

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,680
there's a thing called the credit system

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
where you can

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
note why you were making a code fix or a

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
documentation update or adding a new

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,520
module

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
so over in drupal back in 2019 and they

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,919
do this every year which is great

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,039
65 of their code that was committed in

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,199
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
was wholly sponsored work that means the

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
person who was actually doing the work

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,280
that the individual

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
said that they were either paid by their

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,319
employer as a software vendor

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,680
or in drupal's case a lot of system

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,280
integrators

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
or agency models hire contractors to do

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,319
work

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,039
for specific clients um but again this

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
is a pretty

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,160
um clear recognition that of the major

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,919
open source projects we all use

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
the bulk of the code is done by

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,520
companies having their employees do the

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,039
work which is something that's kind of

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,840
a little bit hidden and again if we look

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
back not just

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
at what code we're using now but what

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
new code is going to come out well where

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,879
do

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
widely used open source projects come

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
from

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
certainly there are some passionate

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,080
hobbyists and some of them especially in

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,360
older times have become the big thing

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,839
certainly in academic and research

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
projects

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,159
apache has at least half a dozen

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,959
academic or that sort of thing projects

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,519
that have come around

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,160
uh geospatial and some math related

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
projects and

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,360
science related projects which really

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
have done great stuff

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
from coming from just academia to a

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
bigger world

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,880
a lot of new projects come from vendor

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,560
groups where one company will get a

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
couple other companies together

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,080
launch something up and of course we

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,440
always have single companies coming and

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
saying hey we want to open source our

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,080
project

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
well the answer is all of the above

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
right

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
the software we use today of the major

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,000
projects you look to them

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,279
you could find a couple of examples from

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,720
each of these categories

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,480
just in the things that you're working

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
on as a developer at least as an end

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
user may not you may not realize where

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
they come from

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,600
but i would say that mostly they were

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,120
companies

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,279
a lot of these open source projects we

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,760
rely on came from

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
corporate vendors in the past because

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
whether

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,760
it came as an idea from one engineer in

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,519
the corporation

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,959
and then became a project of theirs and

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,880
then became open source

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,399
or whether the corporation said we have

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
a proprietary product

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,920
okay we want to open source it for some

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,600
business reason um

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,519
to get to scale in a lot of cases you

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,760
need a company support

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,800
um so that's another important

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,200
aspect of how do projects get built

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,640
is in a lot of cases companies make the

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,320
the effort to start with whether

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,680
directly or through their employees

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
to then bring it to the open source

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,079
realm where we can have a community

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,120
like apache or other foundations work on

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,320
it

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,279
so what do you think about that um in

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
terms of

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,800
did you realize how much of

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,399
obviously marketing and press releases

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,920
from companies it's obvious when a new

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,880
project gets donated because they want

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
you to know about it

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
but did everybody realize how much of

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
the work from the committers around us

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
on the list are done because they're

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
full-time employees and

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,839
and their manager told them to do the

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,399
work which is fine but

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,399
their company is driving that um that's

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
an important part of how open source

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,320
gets built

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,000
and it's something that we don't often

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
it's not always obvious

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,560
when we're following a project along how

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,800
that works

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,720
and some of the difficulty here is um

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
when you're a project contributor you

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
you know the other people on the list

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
whose

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,120
code review you're you're doing or whose

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,320
pull requests you're looking at

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
you know those people and sometimes you

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,760
know who they work for but there are a

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,200
lot of ways that are either

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,000
direct contributions or there are a lot

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,200
of ways that are indirect contributions

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,240
and the backing the financial backing

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,720
behind these

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
isn't always obvious to the rest of the

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,839
community

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,760
so of course direct contributions

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,959
whether it's code which is what we do or

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
documentation

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,839
um cloud credits and services things

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,000
that you work use

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,360
day-to-day a lot of those are donated by

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,120
companies uh either to a foundation or

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
you know just as a as a company effort

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,240
saying any committer on this project can

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,600
use our service for free

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
as long as you're using this product

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
this this this project

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,440
um of course direct contributions

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,920
whether it's an

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,360
individual not being paid or an employee

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,440
being paid

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
indirect contributions again this is big

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,760
and drupal

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,600
where uh companies will hire consultants

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,839
whether it's a consulting firm or

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,720
whether it's an agency model

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,880
where drupal actually has a category for

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
some major

00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,880
non-technology companies that work with

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
major

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
agencies that are drupal experts and

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,920
they track that

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,519
both to the agency and the the funder

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,079
the company who is asking for some new

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,320
feature which is great on their side

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,440
and of course funding so whether it's

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,120
sponsoring a

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,279
foundation or a project directly or

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
whether it's sponsoring an event

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,639
like when we're here at apache gone at

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,360
home make sure to go over to the expo

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,160
booth and

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
check out our sponsors there who help

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,639
make sure that they can pay for the

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,560
event we don't have

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,600
sorry we don't have snacks i've got my

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
coffee you'll have to get your own

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
drinks

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
um but paying for the the hop-in service

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
and paying for

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
the rest of the work around a conference

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
still takes money in a lot of cases to

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,200
do it at scale

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,560
and those are important ways that um

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,000
it's kind of obvious at the conference

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,200
because you see the big signs usually

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,920
when we're in person

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,639
but thinking about all the things that

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,880
that funding

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,560
lets our conference organizers do is

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
something we often don't consider

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,360
and that's a really important factor for

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
when we're actually trying to run a

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,560
conference

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
with someone like sharon or rich or

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,279
brian who've been doing this one

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,720
um that's a huge help that changes how a

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,480
foundation or project can actually be

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,519
able to do things

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,560
well i've been talking about foss

00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:22,160
foundations um which

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,079
can be an independent home that's what

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,120
apache looks to be

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,959
um because for an independent small

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,639
project it's a regular struggle both

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,480
trying to attract contributors

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,240
to make sure your build pipeline is

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,680
still running if you're you know if your

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,959
machine goes down you need to use

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,800
cloud credits um finding ways to

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,320
draw new contributors or even just look

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,399
at old bugs to make sure that they're

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
you know being kept active so one

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,199
important thing is that

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,279
foundations can serve as

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,800
both a gathering point a way to sort of

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,880
get your word out there

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,000
as well as a bunch of other support

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,600
services that can help your project out

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
so what are some of the services that

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,360
foundations can provide

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
hopefully a lot of this is obvious for

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,920
people who are familiar with apache

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,839
software

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,199
foundation projects because we already

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,399
have this but there are a lot of other

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,079
people out there who

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,240
may not have thought of all the other

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
things that happen behind the scenes

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,519
inside the foundation where we try and

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,920
help all of our 200 projects out

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,800
these are just the obvious services all

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,480
right governance

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,160
so the apache way we've talked about

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,519
that many times in the community track

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,519
this year

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,440
mentoring we have different mentoring

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,639
programs and community development

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,240
a legal shield and fundraising of course

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
hosting and build pipelines are the

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,199
apache infrastructure team and their

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
ponies are doing a great job behind the

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,440
scenes thank you

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,519
um some things people don't think about

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,839
until their project gets to be popular

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,639
are respectability or brand management

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
right

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
apache owns all the trademarks and we we

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
will register trademarks for projects if

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,519
they ask

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,920
um and helping out with

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,360
having the apache brand is a huge

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,959
addition to most projects

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,519
just like the linux foundation or the

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,320
eclipse foundation

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,839
those kind of things are intangible

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
benefits of being in a foundation but

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,839
they also take

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
organizing they take work for any of the

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,320
legal

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,880
questions of course they take money that

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,839
means typically sponsorships

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,959
um some things that obviously apache

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,959
does events

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,480
community education and management right

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,000
in terms of community management

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,160
sometimes we think of that as

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,079
as a function of corporations but we

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,800
have a community development project

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,360
here at apache other foundations have at

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,440
least

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,040
whether it's an individual or group the

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,360
same kind of things that

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,600
much like stormy peters was mentioning

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,079
in the earlier talk today

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
ways to help a community understand how

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,440
to work with the rest of the world

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,839
or even how to work together to be

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,199
efficient at collaborating

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,000
and one thing that i think we don't

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,199
think

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,880
for open source people don't think about

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,519
as much as marketing and ecosystem

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
development

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,399
so if you're a corporate developer

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
you've probably thought about that and

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
of course if you're

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,560
a marketing person that's what you do

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,480
but a lot of open source projects

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,120
were spread out as a community and we

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,880
don't necessarily think of that unless

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,560
one of the volunteers in the community

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
has that kind of skill

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,680
and those are important things to help

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,360
get the word out just

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,040
just to make sure that people know who

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,920
you are so they can understand about

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,680
your project

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,079
and maybe someday contribute so

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,959
how do foundations do all these things

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,560
well

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
let's actually start talking about

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,360
services sponsors

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,880
and funding obviously we're all busy

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,160
whether it's with our day job or

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,959
dealing with the world at this point

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,079
and most of us have skills around

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,959
whether it's documentation

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
or testing or code but many of us don't

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,720
have the really

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
strong skills in legal areas or the

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,959
marketing areas

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,600
or if we do we may not have the time

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,079
to contribute in a in a focused way

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
right

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,039
reviewing a legal document it's not

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,360
something you can just do quickly you

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,520
really need to read it and understand it

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,280
so all of these things come from

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,679
services that we

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,959
as foundations typically will go out and

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,799
pay someone for

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,039
much like we have the apache info team

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,520
because few volunteers want to be paged

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,160
when the servers or the cloud or

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,799
anything goes down we have people to to

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
do that

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,840
who work for us which means we need some

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,400
money

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,600
which means we need some sponsors so the

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,520
big question is

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,200
where does most of the money come from

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,919
it comes from corporate sponsors

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
in most cases from sponsorships that are

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,880
sort of

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,919
an annual or somewhat uh reviewing

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,840
renewing thing

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,039
where the sponsor gets some recognition

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,799
and the non-profit

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
because of course these foundations are

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,960
all non-profits that we're talking about

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
here

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,760
are um the foundations so

00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,880
as an example i'd like to talk about

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,520
four major software foundations that

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,280
showcase different kind of not only

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,160
funding models but different ways that

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,600
they might either use or get funding

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,000
and in particular let's look to see who

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,039
is doing the funding so there are there

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
are two questions

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,720
here one is what do the foundations do

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
and how do they get funding

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,120
the other one as the talk before us that

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,360
stormy peters was talking about

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,160
who are the companies who are sponsoring

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,960
these foundations

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,160
or open source projects um and why do

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,760
they do it well that's a tricky question

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,200
so let's start off with the software

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,440
freedom conservancy

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,960
so hopefully people have heard of this

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,440
you may have you may have not may not

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,600
have

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
they actually have 45 separate

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,360
independent projects that

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,640
use them as a sort of corporate home

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,039
the conservancy is a u.s 501 c 3

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,520
public charity so they're a non-profit

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,760
and if you as an individual donate money

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,760
then um you can get a tax write-off in

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,039
the u.s at least

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,520
their projects have independent

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,600
governance and independent branding

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,200
um you'll you'd certainly recognize a

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,240
few of them there are plenty that

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,880
i didn't recognize at first and in terms

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,720
of the services they offer

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,960
they offer legal support ip stewardship

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,320
so of course they will own your

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
trademarks or

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,679
go to court on your behalf if necessary

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,160
um

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,400
they are a fiscal sponsor so of course

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,640
you can donate to the conservancy

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
for the benefit of a specific project

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,760
and they will pass the money along to

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
you so that

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,679
that right there is a huge effort um

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,160
anybody who's tried to get a bank

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
account

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,559
in a in a different state or something

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,600
or get a bank account in a corporate

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,200
name knows

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,880
there's a bunch of paperwork and of

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,360
course taxes to file

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,280
and they handle all of that for their

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,600
member projects

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,679
the conservancy also does a lot of gpl

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,000
compliance work so they have done

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,799
um both some trade work trademark work

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,640
excuse me

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,679
as well as licensed compliance whether

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,400
it's actual court cases or whether it's

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,200
writing about the issue and then uh

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,120
using

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,640
sort of public opinion to force a change

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159
in some corporation that has been

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,440
abusing some gpl

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,440
users so who

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
sponsors the conservancy they've got 45

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,400
projects some are

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,039
medium to big most are smaller um well

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,919
they list six major sponsors on their

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,080
website

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,200
uh which is google linux australia

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,880
mozilla

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,840
private internet access a company that's

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
been uh big into

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,679
uh internet access making it more

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,880
accessible as well as privacy

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,000
red hat and josh triplett thank you josh

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,039
um who are all major sponsors

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,840
who presumably provide them funding on a

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,600
regular basis they don't list their

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,240
sponsorship levels on the website

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,640
but my bet is that the these sponsors

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,320
provide the bulk of their annual income

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
as opposed to they also have a listing

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,720
of individual sponsors

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,559
uh who write you know a small check or

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,000
thankful users whatever

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,880
um so how much does conservancy actually

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,520
make

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,600
from their sponsorships or other income

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,280
and how much money do they have saved

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,240
well let's look um in the u.s

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,159
and most jurisdictions nonprofits still

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,520
have to file taxes now they don't pay

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,480
any taxes typically

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
but they have to file a basic fi form

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,400
which in the u.s

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,080
to the irs is called the 990 form

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,240
so this is an annual filing that sort of

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,640
lists your top level

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,200
income your top level expenses has a

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,640
very brief breakdown of expenses

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,480
and then has a number of checks to see

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
is this non-profit still meeting their

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,919
nonprofit goals are they still

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,360
serving the public good or doing

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,120
education

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,559
things like that that the irs wants to

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,200
make sure that they're not

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,000
masquerading as a nonprofit but really

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,960
being a profit company

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,640
so these are all public figures um

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,080
they're in irs filings they're all

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
public many organizations

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,840
uh conservancy and apache alike both

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,240
publish these 990s

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,280
on our websites some other organizations

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,440
don't you have to

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,440
go to the irs to find them no problem no

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,159
big deal and one thing to note all these

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,760
figures are from a couple of years back

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,400
because of course many people file their

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,080
taxes after the year and many people

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,840
have an extension for their taxes and of

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,440
course the irs takes a while to actually

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,600
publish the form so

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
uh conservancy's form here is the last

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,320
one is from 2017.

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,080
so on the left we can see their gross

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,559
income their total income from

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,720
sponsorships donations each year which

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,679
while they have a bunch of variability

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,360
averaged about two million dollars u.s

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,159
per year over the past

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,039
six years here and on the right hand

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,640
side

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,440
we can see the net assets so the irs 990

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
forms

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,120
while they're not a full financial

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,799
picture they do list total assets and

00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,440
total liabilities which i calculated

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,840
here

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,520
so as we can see conservancy had about a

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,000
million dollars a year in

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,840
in savings whatever investments for a

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,880
few years and then the past three years

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,840
have been

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,559
saving up some of their money so in 2017

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,799
their total

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,880
assets were about three million dollars

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,679
which on one hand might sound like a lot

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,600
on the other hand as a non-profit the

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,880
only income we typically have

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,440
is from donations so when something big

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
happens

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,559
like the thing that's happening now

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,840
we need a cash cushion to be able to

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,480
continue our operations

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,480
even if our sponsors can't afford or

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,039
decide not to continue funding us so

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
this

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,000
this makes absolute sense for um a

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,480
non-profit that's doing the kind of

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
great work that conservancy does so

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,080
that's one example

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,480
let's look at ourselves now and we'll

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,120
look at the apache software foundation

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,120
so as most of us know we have over 200

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,720
community-led projects

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,039
we have a different style of governance

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
so we expect projects to use the apache

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,799
way

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,640
and our branding is all tied to apache

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,799
where it's always apache lucine or

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:12,559
apache iot db

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,720
we are also a 501c3 public charity

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,120
so the services apache offers hopefully

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,159
they're mostly obvious might not be

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,240
um we offer infrastructure so we do a

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,600
lot of hosting ourselves

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,000
as opposed to conservancy which lets

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,640
their projects do their own thing there

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,240
we run conferences yay glad to see

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,919
everybody here

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,360
we have as i said earlier the the

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,240
community development project

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
and we have our diversity and and

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,039
inclusion initiative

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,799
right those are things that help

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,400
mentoring communities if you want some

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,600
help go on over and ask because there

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
are people there who want to help out

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,039
they just need to know

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,000
how they can't help and one thing apache

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,200
offers

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,799
is life cycle support so when you come

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,600
to apache we have the incubator

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,640
that helps train a community how to work

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
in our way

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,400
helps bring in new contributors to grow

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,000
up your project

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
and you can graduate to be a regular

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,840
patchy project and as we had at our

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,760
board meeting last month uh we there are

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,240
older projects who you know the software

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,919
still is still used but

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,679
nobody's developing new code for it

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,159
right it's just there or

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,120
there are any new bug fixes so when we

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,840
don't have enough

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,840
um committers to actively maintain a

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,919
project we move it to the attic

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,880
so the apache attic will make sure that

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,880
any code

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,240
that has ever come to apache will always

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,520
be available for the future

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
now of course in the attic it's read

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,679
only but that's still a resource

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,360
for the world because of course users

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,440
are still using our software

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,799
10 20 years later even if we're not

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,640
developing developing it anymore

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,080
so who sponsors apache so here we have

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,760
as we listen our website

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,760
apache's eight platinum sponsors

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
so let's all give a big thanks to

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,200
verizon media

00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,320
amazon web services 10 cent cloud huawei

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,520
pineapple fund comcast facebook and

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,640
google

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,640
so um each of these sponsors

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,960
pays an annual fee to be listed as a

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,720
sponsor

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,080
in total this represents about eight

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,039
hundred thousand dollars

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,320
of annual donations to the asf uh at

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,559
apache we of course

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,000
we give them a listing we we put them on

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,640
our materials otherwise

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,159
they have no say over how projects run

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,760
right this is a purely a

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,039
financial thing um but again

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,200
this list of platinum sponsors provides

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,080
about half of the annual income for the

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,919
asf

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,200
and of course not listed here are our

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,360
gold silver

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,799
bronze and other in-kind sponsors who we

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,480
also think

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,400
and that's brings up a really good point

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,640
um it's not just

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
sponsoring cash which is important for

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,600
some things because then the foundation

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
can

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,360
as a foundation we can use this cache

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,080
wherever we need it

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,799
uh in any case now or save it of course

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,400
so

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,760
one thing that we're not covering in

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,039
most of this because it's hard to

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,640
quantify

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,440
are in kind sponsorships so the asf

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
has seven targeted sponsors of what we

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,279
call them

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,480
who are uh donating spon services

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:19,279
or other intangibles that we valued at

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,159
a platinum level so our targeted

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,120
platinum sponsors

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,039
are dli piper which is our law firm uh

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,080
verizon media again

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,360
microsoft sonotype nexus uh they do a

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,399
lot of maven stuff

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,440
the osu open source lab uh cloudbees and

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,399
jetbrains

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,240
so these all donate uh services to the

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,960
asf or to our committers

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,360
that our projects need uh these are a

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,600
lot of

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,279
the build pipelines and things like that

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,279
or bandwidths which of course is big

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,039
that while we have a value on them um

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
it's not

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,320
cash but it is a value that our projects

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,080
need

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,240
so that's a that's another thing that's

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,000
much harder to sort of untangle uh it's

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,200
not always obvious when you're

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
running a build or getting something

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,600
from maven central that sonotype nexus

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,760
is actually running the maven central

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,039
service on our behalf

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,799
um which is a lot of bandwidth but the

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,240
it's always obvious who's paying for

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,440
that up front that's just a thing to

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,559
think about

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,600
so how much does the asf make well here

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,120
we can see

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:26,000
from from 2011 to 2017 again um

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,960
the ashf asf has an average annual

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,320
income of about 1 million us dollars

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,919
now 2017 was an unusual year because

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,640
that was also the year that we

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,559
booked the pineapple fund donation which

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,200
was a one-time donation of

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,559
about a million dollars in bitcoin which

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,360
has since been

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,760
turned into cash of course um

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,200
[Music]

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,799
and on the right that's on the left on

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,279
the right we can see our

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,159
cash our net assets how much we have in

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,159
the bank

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,600
which has been about a million and a

00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,840
half dollars for a while of course

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,520
the pineapple fund as a one-time

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,279
donation we we essentially put in

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,960
savings we're not we don't want to

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,559
spend that right away because we're not

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,399
going to get that kind of donation again

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,960
we rely on

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,080
the corporate donors to continue giving

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,120
year after year

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,640
so that's why we saved that one-time

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,440
donation away

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,360
and in 2017 we ended up with just under

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,840
three million dollars in the bank

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,480
so let's switch gears a little bit and

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,640
we'll talk about the eclipse foundation

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,640
now they list 350 350 projects

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,000
um and of course the size of our project

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,919
differs so

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
that have mostly independent governance

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,279
um across the the projects

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,200
various branding some things that

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,520
eclipse use the eclipse branding some

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
are

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,200
are independent uh they have a lot of

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,679
shared releases

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,520
so everything around their ide and

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,039
developer toolings often does a release

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,200
train which

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,679
makes a lot easier for users to sort of

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,960
consume a package together

00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,080
now the the big question here

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,080
that's not obvious is the last line

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,399
under project overview eclipse is a

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,799
501c6

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,159
business league now that's the irs

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,240
terminology here in the u.s

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,760
so that means they're a non-profit they

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,360
don't make a profit they don't have

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,520
shareholders

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,720
but donations aren't necessarily tax

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,960
deductible

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,399
essentially they're a non-profit that is

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,080
they're an organization of different

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,360
businesses combining

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,200
to do a shared service or

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,960
achieve a shared goal of those

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,120
businesses not to make

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,399
profit but they're not necessarily a

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,159
public charity

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,000
as for example most of the places in

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,399
europe would probably not consider

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,440
these at charity because they're still

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,760
working for a business purpose

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,640
and thinking about the services eclipse

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,640
offers

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
of course they offer legal support and

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,480
they they have

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,399
strong ipv controls both on trademarks

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,520
and on their code

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,200
complete infrastructure support as a

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,440
developer

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,120
as developers who build developer tools

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,960
they also have strong development

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,039
process support their release train

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,480
and they offer ecosystem development

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,320
support so when they have

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,000
different plug-ins who want to engage

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,360
with the larger eclipse community

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,200
they have a lot of ways to tie those

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,120
together so there are

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
more active services that eclipse can

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,679
provide for example

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,279
than the asf can because

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,919
they have a slightly different model and

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,519
because a slightly different um

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,440
you know sort of technical world that

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,600
they work in so who sponsors eclipse

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
well here we can see the 13 strategic

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,000
members of eclipse

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,760
which is a variety of companies both

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,320
obvious software companies and some

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,360
non-obvious ones

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,399
importantly the eclipse model

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,279
has a blend between sponsors just of

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,440
cash

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,559
and sponsors who are doing work or

00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,440
taking leadership

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,159
roles in their projects so many of these

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,519
companies

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,760
not only donate cash to eclipse

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,679
but they also promise to have a certain

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,320
number of developers work on their

00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,279
project which of course makes sense and

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,919
many of them

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,360
also participate in clips governance so

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,799
some of these organizations

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,880
essentially have seats on various boards

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,480
at eclipse which is part of their

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,559
relationship they have with their

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,760
sponsors in in the strategic level at

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,720
least

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,760
so that's a dif very different at

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,200
eclipse

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,880
and other 501 c 6 organizations then

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,320
conservancy and the asf where our board

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,640
is completely independent from

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,039
sponsorship

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,480
and just the strategic members of

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
eclipse of course they have

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,519
supporting members and engineering

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,559
members and so on just the strategic

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,480
members here

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,640
uh provide about three million dollars

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,799
annually to eclipse for their income

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,279
which again the strategic level is

00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,640
roughly half of their annual income

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,320
which is right here now we'll note on

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,480
the left the um

00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,679
scale here has changed slightly so the

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,960
eclipse income

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,640
has been pretty pretty steady at about

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,919
four million dollars a year

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,679
um coming in this is

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,679
partly because of the technology area

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,320
they work in but partly because

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,360
again their funding is tied to their

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,360
governance

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
which makes much more stable funding

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,799
situation and we also see their net

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,679
assets

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,440
are were actually negative in 2018 which

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,799
is completely normal that's merely

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,080
how they do accounting the 990 form does

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,840
not at all

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,000
show how eclipse actually does their

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,519
funding the way we would normally think

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,720
of as a report

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,960
but the key thing is they make about

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,120
four million dollars a year and then

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
provide more services to their projects

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,600
so let's look at the big

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,840
question the linux foundation um

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,120
about 150 projects more a little more

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,799
than that

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,720
governance for the projects is mixed

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,880
between community-led ones

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,640
and industry-led ones of course the

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,919
branding is purely independent for each

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,240
of their projects

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,080
and they are again a 501 c 6 business

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,640
league just like eclipse is

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,760
they offer all the standard services in

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,399
fact they offer

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,159
much stronger services because the linux

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,720
foundation is really an agency model

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,079
where

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,159
they have a significant number of

00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,040
employees who are simply service

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,280
providers

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,800
for all of their internal projects so

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,359
they i presume have

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,839
entire teams for marketing and events

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,760
and

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,760
um of course infrastructure and

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,119
community development things like that

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,800
um they have clear ecosystem development

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,079
and they have marketing support

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,000
um at a serious level as we can see from

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,919
you know watching the industry news

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,560
linux foundation products are well heard

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,320
of

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,760
and of course the conference arm so they

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
run their own conference

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,119
they run a lot of conferences for other

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,119
organizations or for their their sub

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,159
projects so there's a lot more

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,079
um happening at the linux donation that

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,599
the foundation itself is organizing that

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,040
their employees

00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:00,320
are running for their projects directly

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,440
so who sponsors the linux foundation

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,720
well that's a complicated question um

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,640
many linux foundation projects or

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,839
which often sound like foundations that

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
are separate but are actually part of

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,520
linux foundation

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,880
have their own funding models so this is

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,440
gonna be a kind of complex

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,359
topic so who sponsors the foundation the

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,520
linux foundation itself

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,359
well these are the 15 platinum corporate

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,400
members of the linux foundation

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,599
now again much like eclipse essentially

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,640
each of these

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,240
platinum sponsors both donates a certain

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,960
amount of money to linux foundation each

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,920
year

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,839
and has a seat on the board of the linux

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,760
foundation as a whole

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,240
so they are directly tied into the

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,440
governance at the foundation level

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,119
um for part of this work this list

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,240
represents about seven million dollars

00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,520
of annual income

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,920
for linux foundation so if we look at

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,040
the

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,720
cncf the cloud data computing foundation

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,320
which is a subsidiary of linux

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,960
foundation so they're part of

00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,760
linux foundation they have 18 platinum

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,280
members

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,760
just for the cncf who are here

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,760
each of them have some sort of role in

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,760
the cncf and each of them donates

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,200
about 250 dollars a year to the cncf

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,880
which of course is really just to the

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,280
linux foundation

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,520
so this represents at least four million

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,960
dollars in annual income

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,160
to the linux foundation

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,160
so if we look at the hyperledger

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,960
foundation also a linux foundation

00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
project

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,880
they have 13 premier members they have

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,000
different names that's okay

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,440
they of course have smaller levels these

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
organizations all have

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,960
some work to do in hyperledger and this

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
list represents about three million

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,000
dollars

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,680
of annual income for hyperledger and the

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,760
linux foundation

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,480
if we look at the openjs foundation

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,640
which has node.js and a number of other

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,720
common things they have floor four

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,320
platinum members

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,240
and we see several names over and over

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
again of course here these platinum

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,680
sponsors here contribute about one

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,040
million dollars in annual income

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,440
to the linux foundation so i could do

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,920
that

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,760
all day but let's just say it's a

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,200
complicated question who sponsors a

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,960
linux foundation

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,960
it's a lot of different companies and

00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,640
many of them repeatedly

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,160
it's not just the software vendors who

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,000
we see over and over again

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,200
in the linux foundation sponsorship

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,079
pages for their many

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,280
many projects it's many non-software

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,200
vendors it's many

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,960
iot vendors who are working on new

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,200
projects in that space

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,560
it's many sort of uh agency and

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,480
consulting companies

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,160
so it's a really complicated question

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,040
where all of their funding is coming

00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,720
from

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,359
and let's look at the big slide at the

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,640
end how much does the linux foundation

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,240
actually make

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,079
so if we look on the left of course

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,119
we're seeing annual income again

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,000
and let's double check yes the scale on

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,720
this graph has

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,440
increased by an order of magnitude so as

00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,200
we can see from 2011 to 2018

00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,960
uh the linux foundation's income has

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,240
been rising in a

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:06,000
pretty nice curve there in

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:10,720
2018 the linux foundation made about 96

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,680
96 million dollars u.s in income

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,240
that's um a bit more than the rest of us

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
okay

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,440
they do a lot more that makes sense and

00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,240
on the right

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,320
we can see their net assets which again

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,680
are listed on their 990 so it's not

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,839
necessarily

00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,880
uh what a accounting person would look

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,680
at but nonetheless

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,240
uh shows how much they have in the bank

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,839
again

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,320
the chart is an order of magnitude

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:38,160
larger we can see they've had

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,440
um about between 20 and 40

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,079
40 million dollars in savings so to

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,200
speak

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,040
uh in the period 2016 to 2018.

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,480
so that is a little surprising to me

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,560
that you would expect they would be

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,560
using that for their projects

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,160
of course we don't have figures for 2019

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,480
because they haven't filed their

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,359
forms yet but it is interesting to see

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,960
that they have a

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,760
much much bigger financial as well as

00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,839
impact footprint in open source compared

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,640
to many other organizations

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,520
so the the big question here is um what

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,440
does it all mean

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,200
and i'm sorry i don't have that answer

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,880
yet but i hope this is

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,280
um giving people something to think

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,880
about in terms of both

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,320
the community and the governance and the

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,400
actual work we do

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,320
that's the most important point of any

00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,880
project um but

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,400
funding on the license and the model of

00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,839
how governance works

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,359
are also really important um

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,520
and often are not something we think

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,520
about in our day-to-day life

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,520
so this is just a reminder to sort of

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,040
think about who is the money behind all

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,359
the different kinds of things

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,440
and i see one question uh eclipse is

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,320
just like the linux foundation right

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,920
um i would say legally they're both the

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,520
same kind of non-profit

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,000
but beyond that no they they

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,359
the eclipse foundation is much closer to

00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,720
a community-led one it's not

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,480
community-led

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,760
but they have a lot of aspects of um

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,280
including community members and their

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,480
things the linux foundation is is

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,440
primarily

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,800
uh industry groups come together decide

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,800
what they want governance to be

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,319
the people who pay the money make the

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,319
decision that's how that group works

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,040
that sort of sub foundation like cncf or

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,920
whatever and eclipse has a lot more

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,040
um technical representation in those in

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,280
those other areas

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,800
so i think we are out of time um i'm

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,359
happy to sit here for a few minutes

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,720
and and answer any other questions uh

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,720
the slides will be posted

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,480
i'll tweet them and of course videos

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,000
will be posted on our

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,599
the apache foundation youtube channel

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,880
in about a week so looking over at my

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,800
little chat

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:53,839
uh any other questions oh hi lawrence

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,839
that was you

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,440
thanks

00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,319
uh so one quote there is uh for store

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,720
recording is

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,520
great talk i had no idea apache did so

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,440
much with relatively so little money

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,280
yes and thank you for noticing um

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,960
much like stormy peter said in the

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,200
previous talk to this one

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,880
uh there's still there's there's an

00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,319
there's a knowledge mismatch

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,240
between a lot of open source

00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,839
organizations who

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,359
foundations who might need money for

00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,400
different things and

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,079
the corporate uh people who might have

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,520
funding right it's not the engineers who

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,280
you're working with it's probably their

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,560
managers or their managers managers in

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,560
some corporation

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,720
who might have funding the way they

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,480
think about when they consider who to

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,599
sponsor and the way we think about

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,040
what we might need money for um

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,720
you know it takes a lot of coordination

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,000
right now and having people like stormy

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,599
and having people like our

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
fundraising team here apache we have a

00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,640
couple awesome people daniel and sally

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,160
in particular

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,640
uh to sort of let us understand

00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,520
how we should approach saying hey apache

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,920
wants to

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,560
have more conferences next year do you

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,280
want to help

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,119
pay for it well what's what's it to the

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,119
company and when do companies have money

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,079
so another question another question is

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,839
what would be an example of an important

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,960
decision that was taken at the asf which

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,359
could be taken

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,240
because it is a community of individuals

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,359
and not of corporations

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,920
uh okay i think the

00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:31,280
best way to answer that would be as a

00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,960
non-answer

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,400
given that i think there are a lot of

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,880
decisions we

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,480
don't have to make because we're not

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,359
beholden to

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,599
any of our sponsors or to other market

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,119
pressures

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:49,040
i think there are a lot of cases where

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,640
you'd be hard to find a solid example

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,040
but a lot of cases where

00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,240
independent projects or other smaller

00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,359
organizations

00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,560
had to change something um or had to

00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:04,000
or or or essentially ended up getting

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,960
uh forked and then overshadowed by

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,560
someone else

00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,200
because they weren't independent and

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,400
apache uh both at the board level and

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,760
and we certainly hope at the project

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
level

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,440
it doesn't matter what marketing is

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,800
trying to do or what

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,119
you know some um overly strong

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,319
corporation let's say just to be polite

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,000
uh is trying to

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,400
bully about something uh apache has the

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,520
resources in terms of the community and

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,560
our structure

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,400
to fend it off and we've actually

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,000
we've had some questions in the past not

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,119
necessarily public where

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,640
uh there are clear signs of corporations

00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,520
either trying to influence

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,720
uh brands and trademarks or communities

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,520
and technology

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,240
where you know the board has the ability

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,440
to

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,200
get into that community and say no

00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,000
that's not okay we need the rest of the

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,119
community to

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,160
help take over um and if not then you

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,240
know

00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,359
we have in some cases remove people from

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,400
pmcs if they're not

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,280
acting on behalf of the project so

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,400
in terms of making a decision um i think

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,480
it's mostly that we

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,839
free communities of individuals to make

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,440
their own decisions

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,839
um immaterial of outside factors like

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,839
sponsorship or funding or you know big

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,040
company marketing campaigns

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,880
i hope that makes sense and i think we

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,000
are well over time

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,880
so good you're welcome and uh

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,960
i would like to let our recording team

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,119
uh free up for the next talk so i will

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,480
say goodbye i will go

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,960
tweet a link to my slides and i hope to

00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,960
hear

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,640
questions about um these numbers and

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,640
what it means later on

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,800
because there's there's a lot more to

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,359
explore here and

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,200
very few of us are financial uh experts

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,800
or accountants so it's not always easy

00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,560
to see

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,319
what the important sides are whether

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,920
it's knowing

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,920
which organizations which which

00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,599
companies are sponsoring who

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,520
or whether it's as stormy was saying

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,480
earlier what our

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,160
organizations need money for we can't do

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,400
with our own effort

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,400
and then how do we go go about that and

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,480
that's there's a lot to explore there

00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,319
and i'm hoping to work on that in

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,640
another new website soon

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,359
so stay tuned and enjoy the rest of your

00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,200
day

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,200
thanks bye

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:33,839
