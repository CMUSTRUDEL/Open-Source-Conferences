	Teaching Open Source
Daniel Ruggeri

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

How did you learn about Open Source? Did you learn from a mentor? Did you learn from a colleague? Did you learn through hard fought experience? For a lot of us, we learned the hard way. But... what if all of the concepts, the tools, the licensing, the methods, and the terms were gathered into a course? Come join our presenter as he walks through his motivations and experience designing and teaching a college-level course about Open Source. We will discuss how to get started, what the curriculum includes, how you could deliver such a course, and other tips and tricks.

Daniel is Vice President of Middleware at Mastercard and an Open Source evangelist. Responsible for setting the direction of Mastercard regarding the Web and Cloud space, he spends his days and nights playing with infrastructure and the code that powers it both inside the firewall and outside. He is a member of the Apache Software Foundation and has contributed code to Open Source projects from simple pet projects to widely utilized servers. As a lover of Open Source, he even taught a course about Open Source Software Development (and will share the curriculum with you!). He has spoken at several conferences about expanding Open Source in enterprises, introducing Open Source, and growing understanding of Open Source in education.
