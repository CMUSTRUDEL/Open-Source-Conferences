	The Apache Way: Practical Open Source Project Management

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

The Apache Way is useful for organizations and individuals to be more effective at working in distributed communities. Open source software does not necessarily mean open development - and true community-led open development is where the fun starts in working in FOSS! There are a lot more aspects to consider and areas to invest in as you move forward through the open source journey. These are just the starting points to work on. A key reminder: open source works best when you're working with softare that you actually use. Taking the time to choose which teams or projects that you open up or participate is well worth the investment to keep your team's efforts focused. Come learn the behaviors you can use to succeed at Apache!

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
okay

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
all right sorry about that i was just

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
trying to figure out for with my track

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,079
host where they had gone and everything

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,160
but uh we're doing great

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,120
uh welcome to the continued community

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,000
track

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,840
here at apache con at home i hope you're

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,399
all enjoying your home like i am here

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
with my

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,399
collection behind me uh we're here to

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
talk about the apache way which we've

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
talked about a number of times but this

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,559
is a little different

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,239
talk and we'll see how that goes as we

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,280
start

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,320
so welcome to my talk

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,039
um the apache way is really

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,359
a set of behaviors and practices that

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,039
have

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,799
been developed at the apache software

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,439
foundation and they're really designed

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,080
to promote

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
long-lived successful projects and we do

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,960
this by focusing on

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
stable governance that people can

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,479
understand and by encouraging new

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,560
contributions

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,840
because really the way any open source

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,680
project lives

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
is by having more contributors that's

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,640
really the lifeblood of any open source

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,159
so that's what the apache way is really

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,080
trying to do

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
and while these work for any sort of

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,880
open source project they are most

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
important for apache

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
software projects because this is the

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,000
expected behavior

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,000
um for any apache project

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,200
so there are a lot of talks and you've

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
heard some of this earlier

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
yesterday and some other apache way

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,680
talks about uh the history and about how

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,920
we grew

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
and how we made up the apache way but

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,000
you know that's not really that

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
interesting

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,920
um how much does history matter to a

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
newcomer how does history and the

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,880
background

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
really help someone figure out how they

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
can start contributing into a project

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,159
so you want actionable information on

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,159
what to do

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,280
and that's what i'm here to give you

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,640
hopefully

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,720
so if we go on to

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,400
the apache way menu here is my choice

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
here's my list of things that we want to

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
talk about and since

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,879
these are all different important

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,200
aspects of the apache way and since

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
apache way it's all about contributions

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,520
it's all about community over code

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,760
usually i ask somebody else in the room

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
when we're together in a room together

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,720
to pick the next topic but since we're

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,680
all separately i'm just gonna pick what

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,599
is the the obvious next topic to talk

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
about which would be of course

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,680
decision making we need to make a

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,720
decision let's learn how apache people

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
make decisions

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
if i can click on the right window so

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,599
decision making

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,160
how do we do it in apache projects well

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
obviously

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,000
you've probably read this in a number of

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,120
places consensus is preferred

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
so consensus within a community is the

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,920
best path forward

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,800
it's not necessarily the perfection it's

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,080
not necessarily

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,159
getting everything done all at once it's

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
going forward step by step is this new

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,680
thing an improvement

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
um does it do something that somebody

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
finds useful because there are a lot of

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,080
times where

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
a feature that i really want to put in

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
you may be like eh

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,720
i don't care okay but do you mind if i

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,519
put it in

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,200
is that okay if you don't mind then we

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
have consensus right you don't care

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,319
i really want to that's an important way

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,080
to do it and

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,080
a formal thing we have at apache

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
projects is lazy consensus where someone

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,440
will

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,959
announce i'm going to do this unless

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,200
someone objects

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,560
and usually they either nobody says

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
anything or somebody says hey you

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
should maybe you should add something

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
great then that person can move forward

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
and then the whole project moves forward

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,200
but sometimes

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
we do need votes so there are

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,319
a couple of different ways we use votes

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,400
one is voting as an official consensus

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,599
so when we make or when a project

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
management committee

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,519
makes a formal release on behalf half of

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,040
the asf

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,599
um we have the pmc as a body of apache

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
formally vote to release that that makes

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,720
the software release an act of the

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,560
foundation and therefore

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,160
our legal shield applies to everything

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,600
that's been done with it

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,360
um those are needed places and sometimes

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,080
we need to use votes to speed up

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
consensus

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
sometimes you know we have a hard

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,199
problem

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
and we some of the project really needs

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
to move forward

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
in that case you know you should try to

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
work on consensus

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,880
but if you need to the pmc can call a

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,759
vote and abide by the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
decisions of that vote now importantly

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,400
when you're

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,600
looking in different projects at apache

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,600
some projects

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
use votes for lots of things which is

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
great because that's how they've grown

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
to

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
run their decisions they've they work

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
with the whole community on that

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
some projects very very rarely use votes

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
they use them for releases and for

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,280
adding new committers

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,199
but everything else is consensus it's

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,000
all up to the project because projects

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
are

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,560
independent in terms of how the general

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,199
ways they decide how to do things

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,280
an important part of decisions is the

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
timeline and we don't have a

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,360
timeline of how long things take we have

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,919
a timeline of the shortest possible

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,440
decision

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,360
cycle we can have 72 hours

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
so whenever we're making a release or

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
making a major code donation

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,479
um you need to open a vote and

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
or consensus and have it open for at

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,360
least 72 hours because this allows

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,479
time-shifted input so people that are in

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
another time zone

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,240
people are that are away for a weekend

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,240
have a chance to jump in and

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
make comment now there are some

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
exceptions for this in particular if

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,560
there is an

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
urgent security release then we don't

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,400
need to have 72 hours right

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
but whenever the project can it really

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,600
should be focusing on this because it

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,960
allows everybody to participate

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,759
participate uh so we don't really have

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,120
deadlines

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
in apache projects um we don't have any

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,039
because

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,800
we only have ones that we agree on

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
together now there are some projects

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,919
that make a great use of making roadmaps

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,160
and publishing those

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,039
and discussing right that's the

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
project's

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,680
desire um that they've agreed on they've

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,840
had consensus on to do together

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
which is great but the only thing

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,479
driving that

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,000
those deadlines for we want to have a

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,840
release you know next year

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,560
we want to have these features done next

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
month is that the people doing the work

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,720
want to have those deadlines so that's

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,520
an important part of our decision making

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,120
is

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,039
it's often focused on letting the

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,759
community have this they have their

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,800
saying

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,080
so let's see where we want to go

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,759
next because as i said there are a lot

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,639
of different places in the apache

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080
way that might be interesting for your

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,720
kind of project

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,360
now as i said usually i make people

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
choose

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,199
things that we're going to do next but

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,319
i'm just going to be lazy here

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
and i'm probably going to go with

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,000
community over code because

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,360
that's the most um no that's our

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,080
our touch phrase of what apache is all

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,880
about it's about community over code

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,880
so community

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
uh what do we mean by community here

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
well we don't

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,599
live together we don't work together

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
usually

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,840
we don't know each other except through

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,319
the project

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,960
so that's an important thing to

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
understand

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,800
that we need to focus on the entire

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,479
project community

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
and understand that it's not just those

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,280
of us who we are working with on code or

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
maybe

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,199
working on our team together on this

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,479
thing it's every developer it's every

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
user

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,120
it's all the testers people who submit

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,440
bugs around the entire project space

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,000
so anyone who comes to an apache project

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,479
whether it's email or slack or whatever

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
and wants to interact that's part of our

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
community and that's what's the

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,230
important thing about most apache

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,400
projects

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,280
[Music]

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,160
a key early message was no jerks allowed

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,879
and yes this was

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,080
in an early apache wave presentation uh

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
because

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,759
we um we value the community

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,960
there's no simpler way to say it value

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
communities value

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,800
group contributions not lone wolves so

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,120
we want

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
the group to be successful so people who

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,319
can work within the group

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
and help out the project as a whole

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,440
rather than just doing their own thing

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
they may be fast but

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,960
might not be exactly where the project

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
wants to go

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,879
another important thing is apache is

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,879
about long-lived projects

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,399
so having a diverse community that

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,320
welcomes different input

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,800
is critical because that will draw in

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
new people right new people will see

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
hey somebody over there was welcome

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,480
somebody from this company was welcomed

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,160
i could show up to so an important one

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,279
it's not really a rule but it is obvious

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,920
uh bdfl benevolent dictators for life

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,959
are not allowed in apache pmcs every pmc

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,200
is has a group membership equals who run

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,240
each project

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,360
so part of this lesson is really the

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,560
immortal words of

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,600
bill and ted be excellent to each other

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,080
um because remember when everyone else

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
in the project is a volunteer

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,279
being decent and being kind is a way to

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
get them

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,680
to respond to your messages otherwise if

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,760
you're being a jerk why do i

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
care to you know work on your bug i'm

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,160
gonna work on something that interests

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,360
me with people who

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,959
are respectful of my time so this is

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
i mean this is a lesson a lot of

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,440
projects are taken very seriously these

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
days but

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,240
um it's a particular question in apache

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
projects we expect this

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,519
[Music]

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,880
uh so community wearing your hats is uh

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,640
sometimes a tricky

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
metaphor it's not a very good one for

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,440
especially for non-english speakers

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,839
out there um apache does not allow

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
direct corporate participation in

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,160
projects

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,240
and you say well what about all these

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
companies people from ibm and red hat

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
and

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,320
microsoft and google who work on

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,399
so-and-so project well yes

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
apache recognizes individual

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,680
participation

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,519
so those of those people those

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,399
committers in our project part of our

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,040
community

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,880
may be working for some big company but

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,600
we expect that when they're

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,880
at their apache project in our spaces

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,120
that they will

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,959
act in the best interest of the project

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,000
that they will be an apache committer or

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,640
an apache pmc

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
member when they're voting on a release

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,000
not just

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,760
a google employee or an oracle employee

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,440
yes we do have some oracle people at

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
apache

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
so a couple side effects here that

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
aren't obvious

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
if you have a corporate team and you're

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,360
joining up with a project

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
each employee participates separately i

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
don't know that all these people

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
who work for your company are together i

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,440
just see them as separate people so you

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,399
need to understand as

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,399
a manager perhaps that each employee

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,279
will have a different path towards merit

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
in a project

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,600
which is important to understand how to

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,079
plan your work

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,560
the side effect for you as an employee

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,880
is that your merit stays with you

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,800
apache recognizes your contributions

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,640
from you we don't care who you work for

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,320
or where you live

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
when you get merit and project that

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
sticks with you whether you change jobs

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,000
or move or retire

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,519
congratulations if you can't so

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,440
this is another part of that is uh

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
how you act hopefully you're acting for

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,519
the best interest of the project

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
but check your affiliation at the door

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,240
right don't

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,760
you don't need to be obvious about where

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,200
you work you can certainly

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,800
have it in your signature line that's

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,560
fine

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,320
but we're not talking about a hierarchy

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,480
in projects each project is one

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,640
community that decides together

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
every volunteer in a project has the

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
same powers

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
whether they're a manager in real life

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,720
or a technical

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
expert or a fellow or they're still in

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,640
college

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
and just learning javascript and doing

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,880
their first project

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
we don't care what your day job role is

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
what we care about is

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,360
how you interact with the project what

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,720
you can bring

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
that the project will move the project

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,120
forward

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,279
and a key part of um

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,800
community obviously apache is

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,959
independent governance

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:15,680
so that's the par reason we want to have

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,560
separate um diverse communities in terms

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,040
of employment

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,000
is because we are an independent home

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
for projects not

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
beholden to any vendor or group of

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,920
vendors even

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
a key way that this happens is

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
organizationally so

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,680
the asf the apache software foundation

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,000
as a legal entity

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,360
owns all the trademarks of apache

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,760
projects on behalf of those projects

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,279
that means the organization including

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,760
the board of apache

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,880
are the ones who make final decisions on

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,880
brands now

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
this never comes up in terms of a

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
project decision

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
but it does help when the project needs

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
to push back

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,320
shall we say on some vendor who's trying

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,600
to abuse their name

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,360
um the fact that apache owns owns all

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,760
the brands is a key way that we can

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
stay independent because that's really

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
what attracts people to a project is the

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,160
brand the trademarks

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,630
you know how you find out about a

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,040
project um

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,519
[Music]

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,040
pmcs themselves can own the brand right

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,399
the messaging around it how do they want

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,040
to have a tagline

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,079
they design their own logos that's great

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,160
um and they

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,320
are expected to govern their community

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,360
independently following these apache way

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
um mores so a key thing a way the way to

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
think about it is

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,800
it's not a hierarchy the only hierarchy

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,639
is if someone on a pmc

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
and they can vote on releases or

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,240
somebody committer and they do code

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,360
right um that's the only difference so

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,079
if we will go forward and

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,079
we've covered decision making of course

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,120
and we've covered community

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,760
um where should we go next now that's a

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,560
good question

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
because i'm not i don't want to be

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,680
obvious

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
because that wouldn't be that wouldn't

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,320
be fitting and a shame presentation

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
about the apache way

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
let's skip over merit for now and

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,279
actually let's talk about

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,839
communication okay we'll go forward to

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
communication

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,760
so how do we communicate how do we

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,880
interact with each other

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,800
when we're in apache project spaces well

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,079
hopefully the first obvious answer is be

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,199
kind

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,120
um everyone here is human being and

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,720
just as important i i want to say more

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,360
importantly but as importantly

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,440
we're all here as a volunteer so if

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,440
you're being kind with your bug report

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,079
or bringing in your brand new file

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,240
system driver you want to contribute

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,600
and you're being thoughtful and

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,920
welcoming when you

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,279
when you present it to a project i'm

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,639
going to listen because you're somebody

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
i would want to listen to and

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,079
okay i'll spend the time to work on the

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,120
technical side

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,920
if you're being a jerk i'm a volunteer

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,120
i don't have time for that and that is a

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,760
factor across

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
almost all projects right um we don't

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
have

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,160
we we often do have serious

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
disagreements but we need to do them in

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,639
a way that still maintains the kindness

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,199
because

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
that's part of your reputation around uh

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,720
the project

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
and of course we're all um on our own

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
schedule so

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,639
uh that's another way to be kind makes

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,720
people want to work in the project

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,399
so netiquette or ask smart questions

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
there are plenty of resources out there

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,360
for asking smart questions

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
reproducible bug reports with all the

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,639
data in there

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,079
clearly communicating what you want to

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,199
do why you want to do it

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,519
to at least some information and how you

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
know

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,839
you want to add your new feature or how

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,600
you think the next user conference

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,079
should work

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,199
asking smart questions means respecting

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,560
the time

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,880
of all the volunteers who are going to

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,000
read your request

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,839
[Music]

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
this for large projects this will be

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,639
hundreds of people just on the developer

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
list

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,560
uh who read the list regularly so being

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,120
smart about how you present your

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,360
information

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,360
just like in a business context uh but

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
it's doubly important here because

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,680
uh everyone you're trying to engage to

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,440
work with is a volunteer not beholden to

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,600
your schedules

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,320
and of course in the modern language

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,199
modern day we have a code of conduct

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,759
so the apache software foundation has a

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,680
policy

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,519
which is linked here in the slide this

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,160
applies to all spaces around the

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,480
foundation

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,680
including this conference right now the

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,240
conference has additional

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,120
codes as well and we expect that all

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,160
projects will

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,759
adhere to this and will keep their

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,920
community spaces friendly and welcoming

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,880
and and the great great great majority

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,800
of times they do

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
which is great uh but you do need to

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,079
have a policy listed

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,079
for when things don't always work

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,759
so this is a tricky one because it's

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,240
this is

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,199
more part of apache not necessarily any

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,000
open source

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,880
the core development activity must be in

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,519
english

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
now i know that sounds harsh to a lot of

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
people who aren't

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,559
native english speakers it's not that

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
development can't be done that way

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,400
it's that translation software isn't

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,280
isn't social right we don't have

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,079
magic translation especially for nuanced

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
things in

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,039
where you want to plan your to go ahead

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
in your project you want to add a new

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,199
streaming module

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,439
right but you're writing it in chinese i

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,480
can't read chinese unfortunately sorry

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,319
um which means the people who aren't

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,000
speaking your language

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,880
can't help participate in the work so

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,480
english is is uh very widespread um and

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
it is pretty widespread the technical

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,039
community

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,799
um but the part it pointed apache is

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
we need our communities to be able to

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,200
understand where plans are going so they

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,000
can evaluate things and

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,679
going one step further back the board

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,400
provides oversight to all communities

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,280
and the board

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,880
reads quarterly reports the board at the

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
current time

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,080
we only have enough depth of

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,640
understanding in english to be able to

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200
provide

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
the expected oversight so this is one of

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,840
the things that um

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,520
is unfortunate about our model that we

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,039
haven't scaled that yet we're certainly

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
working thinking about it

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,160
um and it doesn't mean that you can't

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
have your own

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
natural language development lists but

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,440
the core

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,039
planning activities and the pmc need to

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,160
be able to communicate in english so

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,520
that they can work with

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,280
the rest of the apache projects out

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,080
there

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,240
so where should we go next um

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,720
well we've covered community open

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,919
development

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,240
communications decision making oh i

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,640
guess

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,520
it's time for well we should talk about

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,400
being open

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:47,440
because that really is what drives

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
uh all sorts of things um in our

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,640
projects

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,160
so let's go over to open development and

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,960
uh for those of you who are in a colder

00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,160
climb we can wish we were someplace

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,840
with warm breezes and few worries

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,000
um but this should be obvious

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,160
that we do things openly but why and and

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
what are the aspects of being open that

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,240
are most important

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,760
well uh yes we use mailing lists um

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,919
there are many different interfaces we

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,960
have ponymail which is the

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,360
uh list archive which has super

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,400
uh searching and sorting and threading

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,679
but uh most people

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,360
really just use their email client which

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,200
allows asynchronous communication of

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,760
course because

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
we are a community that's dispersed in

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
space

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,760
we're a community that's dispersed in

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
abilities and expertise

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,880
so when when you read the development

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,320
plan

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
maybe you're an experienced developer it

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,440
takes you 10 minutes when i read it it

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,160
might take me

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
a couple of hours i might not have time

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,320
i might be

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,280
taking my daughter to the music lesson

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,799
or i might have

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,559
an emergency at home and i still want to

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,240
be able to participate in the work that

00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,160
our projects go doing

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:04,840
um we may be dispersed in time zones and

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,679
and motivation so it's important that we

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,520
um

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,919
do everything openly right so that

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,600
everyone can see the information

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,440
and it's important that we allow some

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
time shifting that's what the 72 hour

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
rule is for example when we we need to

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,760
make a decision

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,440
all we need to have at least 72 hours

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,080
before we close the decision up

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,520
so that people in other time zones uh

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,240
can understand it

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,200
um remember we only know each other

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,840
through the project

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,200
and through the mailing lists really or

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,520
our code commits or

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,280
bug reports obviously but those are

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,480
often reflected on mailing lists so

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,799
it's important to take the time

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,080
and really allow email to work don't

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,680
just treat it as slack all the time

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
which of course means that um

00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,240
[Music]

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,080
we archive everything right if it didn't

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,400
happen on list it didn't happen

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,679
uh as far as i'm aware that phrase

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,799
started in apache

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,240
uh many years ago um asynchronous lists

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,880
provide time for

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
feedback critique new ideas others to

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
show

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,919
different work um over time and that

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,200
means not just

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,720
time today or this week that means time

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,159
next month or maybe time next year

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,600
there are i can't count the number of

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,440
times in projects and inside the

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,559
foundation where we've said

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,200
we've had this serious question of how

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
should we do this

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
and there are a lot of opinions and

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
someone will come up and says

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,400
say hey we discussed this exact thing

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,600
back then

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
okay good but hey here's the part of the

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
email thread

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,799
where we say why we made this decision

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,799
having everything archived

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,840
allows that communal understanding in

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,960
the archives

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,080
of how we got here and why we got here

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,200
and importantly at apache everything

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,600
is publicly archived permanently we

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
we incredibly rarely um edit the

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,760
archives

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,039
we do have a few private lists but you

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,000
should only use those when you

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,000
absolutely need to

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,280
you should not be defaulting to a

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,320
private list just because something's

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,240
embarrassing or

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,720
you're not sure it should be on a public

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,840
list because that helps newcomers learn

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
at any time

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,880
especially the in terms of a year from

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,720
now

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,039
we may know how we got someplace a year

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,000
from now but a newcomer showing up

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
then won't know why we got there and

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,520
they have the chance

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,559
even without asking they want to search

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,320
to understand

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,480
how do we get there where has the

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,919
project been so that's a critical reason

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
why we archive everything and we keep it

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,840
forever

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,240
as far as as long as we'll be around

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,559
certainly

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,760
so transparent decisions it's i'm trying

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,559
to figure out how

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,600
the best way to describe this is one is

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
if you're coming from

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,360
outside an apache project one thing to

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,000
realize is that

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,440
open source does not always mean open

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,520
development

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,200
so the source and in many projects on

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,679
github or in corporate

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,600
open source projects it's open source

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,440
but how they develop that

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,280
the process by which they add new things

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,440
or accept bug reports

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,720
is not open it's not an open decision

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,799
process it's

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,320
closed either the original repo owner or

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,360
the company right

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,080
so what's important here is the the

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,120
community

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,760
in an apache project as a whole owns the

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,640
project

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,200
and manages this project so when you

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,440
come in

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
your motives aren't transparent to the

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,159
community

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,760
like if you're working in a software

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,880
development company you're used to being

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
on a team where

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,520
you know everyone in the team can

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
understand where your company is going

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,120
and what

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,320
what other teams are doing here all of

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,520
us at apache are

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,919
you're just somebody working on a

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,200
project um you may have

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
your boss has deadlines you may just be

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,760
you need a feature for some new release

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,760
that you're doing on your private

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,520
website

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
those things they're interesting to you

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,120
and that's important driver

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
but how does some decision how does some

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,520
change you want to make

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,320
benefit the project that's the trick

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,919
is explaining to the project of all of

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,320
us

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,240
what you want to do so key ways to do

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,159
this are telegraph your intent

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,080
so if you know you want to do something

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,360
send an email to dev with your ideas

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,200
ahead of time right give the community

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,400
time to give feedback on that idea

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,760
saying maybe i'll say

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,960
hey we already have a better streaming

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,960
model have you seen x

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,240
when you're drafting your design put the

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,400
rough draft out

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
yes it's not it may not be pretty yet

00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,200
but it allows the rest of the community

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,880
to help refine the draft so hopefully by

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
the end it'll be the project's

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,159
plan for moving forward because

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,120
everyone's participated

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,720
you've gotten better ideas um and then

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,760
the community has ownership going

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,039
forward

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,720
and a key thing for coders is submitting

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,960
your work in chunks

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
don't wait three days until the entire

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
thing is coded and tested and you've

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,640
gone through the documentation

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,799
submit your api draft put that in

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,080
submit okay here's my first step of just

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,520
the file transport

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,520
submit the next thing because that

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,520
allows feedback along the way

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,279
there are plenty of times where after

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,000
the third module goes in someone says

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,240
hey

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,440
these two apis aren't consistent let's

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
fix them now

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,960
so that as we go forward we don't have

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,400
to do rework

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,240
these are all things that when you're

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,760
when you're fully open about each step

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,279
of your process and development or

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,720
testing or

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,640
planning a new documentation site uh

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,640
allows the whole community to improve

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,880
the work as it's happening

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,559
it takes a little extra work to start

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,600
with when you're not used to it if

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
you're in a big

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,279
company or if you've been used to

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,520
working by yourself but there is a

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,200
ton of benefit uh both to you and to the

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,080
project when you do where your work is

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,400
this way at apache

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,159
a key thing about open development is uh

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,039
this does really does fit with

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,240
with this topic excuse me is the

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,039
pragmatic license

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,840
so um apache is often synonymous with

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,919
our license

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,440
which is now apache license version 2.0

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,640
that's the name of it

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,320
the point of our license um is maximum

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,799
user freedom

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,640
so as opposed to for example copyleft or

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,559
gpl style licenses which

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,720
want to ensure that the code itself is

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,720
free we want to make sure that the

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,880
users of the code can do whatever they

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,039
want with it right

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,960
that's important because that will then

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,760
attract more contributors back to the

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,919
project

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,200
we have virtually no restrictions as

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,960
long as you're not going to sue us or

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,679
use our trademarks of course

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,039
um for whatever kind of use you want

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,240
wherever you want

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,279
that allows people to come to apache and

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,960
contribute because they don't have to

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
worry about

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,320
what the contributor model is we're very

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
open about it and it's it's fully open

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,640
and it's

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,760
maximum user freedom and a side

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,039
it's not really a side effect but a

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,320
thing that people often don't think

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,640
about is

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,760
the reason people find apache projects

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
so appealing

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,679
is trust in the asf as a corporation

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,480
so behind all of our projects we have

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,279
the board

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,400
and the asf as an independent non-profit

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,720
charity

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,559
that will ensure that we try and

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
maintain our values here that we will

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,360
always have our servers running as long

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,799
as we're around

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,279
that we'll continue to provide source

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,000
code so another benefit of

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,600
apache in particular and and most other

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
open source foundations

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,279
is that when a project is no longer

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,120
actively maintained

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,840
it doesn't just go away it's not like

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,600
some github owner can delete their repo

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
at apache we keep the source code

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
forever

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,000
so when projects don't have enough

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,159
maintainers

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
people are still using it but it's not

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,200
being updated

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,120
we put our our old code in the apache

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,559
attic where we box it up

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,240
keep it safe it's all read only every

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,159
mailing list archive ever the whole

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,120
website every release we published

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,520
are still there um so that you know when

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,600
you

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,880
realize hey i actually am using this 20

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,120
year old version of software

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,480
i need to fix it we will always have

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,399
that there for you

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,480
so that's another hidden benefit of

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:09,120
foundations that i think a lot of people

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,520
don't really think through in the larger

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,640
uh

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,600
question so we need to make one last

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,080
decision

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,720
of where what behaviors should we talk

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,840
about next

00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,440
well we'll play the game seeing of uh

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
who remembers what things we've talked

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,960
about and figured out which thing

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,520
obviously we're going to go to next and

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,320
congratulations to whoever figured that

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,880
one out

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,880
because obviously it would be merit

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,919
ah i could really use a drink about now

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,480
something nice and

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,240
cool and pineapply oh look there's a

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,760
pineapple

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,760
uh merit is

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,679
we often use the word meritocracy but

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,279
that's that's a bad

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,320
it's often not understood the same way

00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,760
elsewhere so we should avoid that

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,960
probably i should have said it

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,559
merit is what you have actually done

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,880
so your merit in in our context is the

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,480
is the value you've brought to a project

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,520
the contributions you've made

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,799
the smart bug reports you've added the

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,720
documentation you've written that helps

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,360
people out

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
that's as defined in the context of that

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,760
project

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,559
not not outside the project in the

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,440
project by the project community

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,360
so an important thing here is every

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,000
project has their own merit structure

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,520
so apache has over 200 completely

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,559
separate projects

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,080
um that do their own things that

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,440
you know what's important one project

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,600
may not be important to another one

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,799
another project

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,640
um the good thing about merit is uh

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,159
it doesn't expire typically so once

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,279
you've gained a committer

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,799
bit for example on one project then we

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,080
won't take that away from you unless

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,080
you do something really wrong the key

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,240
part is that stays with you through your

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,320
job through your careers so there are

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,919
plenty of people who have

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,760
moved on in different jobs moved to

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,039
different technologies but still come

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,720
back and for whatever reason because

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,080
they use the project

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,919
or because it turns out their new

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,520
company needs it are still committers on

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,799
apache projects years later

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,679
and still come back and continue

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,799
continue to do great work

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,320
um so the way to think of it is

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,799
when we talk about merit if you don't

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,600
quite get what it is you gain merit

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:29,039
within that project by doing things that

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,840
community values things that that

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,360
community

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,480
thinks are useful and then that is shown

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,360
by the growth

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
the more you do that we value the more

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,559
power

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,960
power you may be granted to take actions

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,120
so obviously every user is welcome to

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,080
to browse everything to write up to our

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,760
mailing lists

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,600
every contributor thank you thank you

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,440
for contributing whatever it was

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,000
um the real step here is committer

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,720
so contributors to different projects at

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,559
apache

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,840
can eventually be voted in as a

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,519
committer on that project

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,840
um that allows you to

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,120
uh excuse me that allows you to submit

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,080
code to the project

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,240
um directly into the repository so you

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,279
have write access that's so to speak

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,720
um the next step there is

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,120
um being voted in as a pmc member

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,720
so in a lot of cases it doesn't matter

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,120
if your pmc member or committer

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,080
everybody's working on the code the one

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,960
difference is

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,320
that pmc members have binding votes on

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,640
making releases

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,519
so when we make a former formal release

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,760
of an apache software project

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,600
the pmc voting on it formally makes it a

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,200
release of the foundation

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,799
as an organization so it's not the

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,159
release manager who's doing it

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,519
it's the foundation who's doing it and

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,720
that helps with our legal shield of

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,399
course

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
the other thing that pmc members can do

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,960
is vote in new committers

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,840
or propose new committers or propose new

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,399
pmc members excuse me

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,200
there's another step above that not

00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,240
really above that

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,559
to the side which is a pmc chair

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,399
so the chair isn't really anything

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,360
special on the pmc

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,559
they are however the liaison between

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,960
that project

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,760
and the board of apache so every project

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,679
in apache

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,600
reports on a quarterly basis to the

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,039
board letting us know how they're doing

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,720
what releases they've made

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,320
any issues they have that they might

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,559
need help on

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,600
the pmc chair is a vice president of the

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,960
project

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,080
which is a title but that is the

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,880
main job is to talk to the board

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,360
another level here in the in growth of

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
merit

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,000
is apache software foundation member so

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
members of the foundation are separate

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,440
they are effectively legally

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,559
shareholders

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,159
of the organization itself um

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,919
they don't really if you if you look

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,240
here they're not in bold they don't

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,519
apache members don't have any additional

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,799
permissions on projects

00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,159
right they show up in a project they're

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,600
just another committer or another

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,120
contributor excuse me

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,399
um they do have some visibility into the

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,679
rest of the foundation now the

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,279
foundation works

00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,799
but it's not a tactical one it's an

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,600
organizational one

00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,039
and of course the the top of what we

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,799
call a growth chart i suppose

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,720
is a director a director of the

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,480
foundation who are

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,080
just like in any other corporation there

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,960
on the board of directors and

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,880
uh set strategy and and appoint officers

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,799
things like that

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,320
but again this is things that you've

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,760
done that are valued that will get you

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,799
recognized

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,200
and it's permissions to do things it's

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,559
not

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,159
authority so anybody who's coming from a

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,600
big company background

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,840
uh often you say go well who's the

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,480
manager on this project we don't have

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,320
managers on projects now the pmc are

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,440
leaders because they have a final say on

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,679
some things

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,760
but it's not really a hierarchy still

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,720
every project is still

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,840
essentially a flat two level layer of

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,679
pmc members and committers

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,279
so it's important to think of merit it

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,399
gets you privileges it gets you the

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,240
privilege to

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,359
commit code or to vote on new committers

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,639
but merit does not buy you authority the

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,320
community must still agree

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,359
you still don't get to make unilateral

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,040
decisions and you still don't

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,919
necessarily

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,200
have more of a decision power than

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,280
someone else in the project

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,679
every pmc member gets one vote like

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,240
everyone else

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,800
so one um one problem area in the past

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,359
has been

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,560
umbrella projects so an important thing

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,720
if you're thinking about

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,240
the way the way all the organization

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,599
behind this works

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,200
is apache jakarta long ago um was an

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,240
umbrella project which had many many

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,040
different java

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,000
bits in it each with different community

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
different components

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,879
but also with different communities and

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,560
they worked in different areas some of

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,280
them had different technologies

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,560
and there was no way that the apache

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,000
jakarta pmc

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,640
which was over 200 people i think

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,640
could could understand the changes being

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,280
made in all the different areas

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,200
um that's a problem from from our

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,520
organizational point of view because

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,680
then the pmc can't really give a good re

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,599
report on what's happening everywhere

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,640
so a key thing at apache is we try to

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,960
keep projects scoped to somewhere that

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
anyone in the pmc can have a basic

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,040
understanding of the rest of

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,599
how the project is working because that

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,560
way

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,760
we have more people who can comment help

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
hey so so-and-so is ready for being a

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,960
committer or

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,960
yes that's a great idea we should do

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,400
that but we need to change this part

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,680
um so if we go on to

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,839
take a different way we can

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,520
see that we are actually at the end

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,760
so i'd like to thank everyone for

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,920
attending um and say of course

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,800
as a place that values community over

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,520
code

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,960
and is open source of course the apache

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,800
way needs your input

00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,160
so are there ways that we can explain

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,320
these concepts better

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
please let me know these slides of

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,359
course are

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,720

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,960
an entire section on the apache way

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,839
which has different explanations that

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,160
sort of

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,599
show how things work directly in apache

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,480
projects

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,599
and that is about all that i have for

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,880
the talk

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,320
and let's see what questions we might

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,440
have in the couple of lists

00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,640
couple of minutes left that we have

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,520
unfortunately i missed the first two

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,040
callers okay uh great i see that

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
people have been able to hear me while

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,920
i've been talking um

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,839
are there any other questions um or

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,200
uh should i i wish i put pictures of my

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,240
cats in this that would have been the

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,839
perfect ending

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:55,839
a perfect ending to a talk

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,839
okay good thank you paulo um

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,520
and again this is just

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,119
these slides which are posted on my

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,320
website are only

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,240
one way to think about the apache way

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,480
what i've focused on here

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,040
are the behaviors that are important the

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,160
way you would act in a community

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,760
and a little bit of the why there are

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,359
at least three or four other current

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,400
apache way talks two of them were given

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,200
yesterday

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,920
um that talk about very specific aspects

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,880
or

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,000
the ways that communities our pmcs

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,520
should think about

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,200
working with people so there are a lot

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,000
of different ways to work on this

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,760
and sometimes you know we have different

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,440
some projects have different ideas

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,960
and that's actually a fine thing right

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,800
there are times where projects come to

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,680
the board and say hey

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,280
we know that the pmc guidelines say x

00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,760
but our project had been doing y for a

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,320
while

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,240
and it works a lot better for us and

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,240
when projects can show us

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,079
how that encourages collaboration how

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,160
that brings in new contributors

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,200
and the board is happy to say oh that's

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,280
a great idea

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,960
that's okay for your project why don't

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,160
you write it up and see if that can help

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,760
somebody else

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,000
so there's a lot of improvement to be

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,280
done and a lot of new ideas that we are

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,599
looking forward to hearing from from

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,599
everyone

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:25,040
so is that it

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,040
am i still on tap tap tap tap

00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,680

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,079
available on the apache foundation

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,920
youtube channel

00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,079
in about a week once our volunteers

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,040
actually can go and put them up there

00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,079
and do all the

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,880
bits that are necessary and

00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,599
we hope to see you on the internets and

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,680
i hope to see

00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,520
people's suggestions for how to make

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,800
this stuff easier to use

00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,880
because as i've said we want to find new

00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,560
contributors we want to make it easy

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,880
for new people to contribute both to our

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,160
code and to our projects

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,680
