Description: 
	Open Source changes the world!
Bertrand Delacretaz

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

In a world that's increasingly digital, Open Source software is everywhere: in your phone, your elevator, your car, behind your bank account...more than ever, Open Source is at the heart of our world. Beyond these very concrete contributions to our society's well being, Open Source communities have also helped design innovative collaboration techniques, especially around remote and distributed work. Often running without a formal boss and without a formal schedule, Open Source communities consistently produce software that's of great quality, sometimes world-changing. COVID-19 has prompted many companies and organizations to speed up their transition to digital transformation and distributed collaboration. This talk will show what Open Source communities can bring to this new world, based on a number of concrete example where simple tools and techniques make all the difference in terms of digital and remote collaboration.

Bertrand Delacretaz works as a Principal Scientist for Adobe in Basel, Switzerland. He's involved in software design and development for Adobe Experience Cloud products, which use many open source modules, mostly from Apache projects to which his teams contribute extensively. Bertrand is currently (2020-2021) on his eleventh term as a member of the Apache Software Foundation's Board of Directors and has been active in the Foundation for about 20 years.

unfortunately so that's that's how

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,760

to be able to do this presentation and i

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,199
hope you will

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,840
enjoy it i'm speaking to you from

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,000
switzerland from my home office

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,320
i live on lake norchatel which is a very

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,439
nice lake here

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,119
it's a good place to be and of course

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,920
yeah i would enjoy travel as well but

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,520
that's

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,880
that's how it is so this talk is about

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,759
open source changes the world uh

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,159
really you know it's a bit presumptuous

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,640
to say that but i think

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,840
yeah open source does change the world

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
in many ways

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,880
and i'm going to to explain a few of

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,920
them

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,360
um so i've been involved in open source

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,280
since year 2000 i would say

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,399
i started in the apache software

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,399
foundation through

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:50,240
fop i donated a module to um

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,079
to generate rtf documents and

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
the line at the time was that it was

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,560
already too late to

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,759
uninvent rtf it's i don't like that

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,320
format but it the

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,799
you know the tool was useful and then i

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,560
i joined the cocoon project which was a

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,880
was a very nice

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
community i'll talk about that a bit

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,679
more and now

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
the only project that i'm currently

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,720
active in is apache sling

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,319
which is a web very modular web

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,400
framework written in java

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,720
osgi and that i use in my work for adobe

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,120
where i work on the adobe experience

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,480
manager which is a large-scale

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
web content management in the in the asf

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
i'm involved i'm currently on the board

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,319
of directors

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
i also mentioned that in the

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,400
presentation it's a great way to

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
you know see how the function or how the

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,319
foundation foundation works

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,599
from the inside and interact with the

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,560
the great people

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
who are active in it

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
uh i need to be able to change myself

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,800
yes

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
so if this is your your view of open

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,599
source

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:58,239
um it's i would understand it

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,680
i suppose i'm kind of probably preaching

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
to the choir here

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
so you know what open source is about

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,360
but i've done this presentation in a

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
in a more general public conference i

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
would say and

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
some people will see open source like

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,959
that you know a bunch of hippies

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,239
uh sitting on the the edge of the road

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,640
and not really sure where they're going

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
if you look at esf it's it's not like

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,959
that it's uh

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,480
or you know it's that it's much more

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,720
serious than that

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,400
and though we try to keep the openness

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,159
and the freshness of those

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,360
those times maybe um i

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,000
the first time uh i got elected

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,640
as a as a on the board of directors of

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,159
apache was in 2008

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,239
and um some people in my family

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,440
they were okay they were excited about

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,239
it which is cool

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,840
but my i remember someone saying oh

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,560
better at school you're going to have

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
more money

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
you're becoming director uh no and you

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,200
know in the asf you

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,159
we not get any money actually for being

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,519
a director

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,560
it's all it's a volunteer uh you know

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,519
task and uh so there's no there's none

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,799
of that

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,280
um but i would say uh

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,439
being a director or being a member of it

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
of the apache social foundation

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
has brought me a lot in terms of

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
learning in terms of meeting great

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,600
people

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,600
in terms of you know seeing what the

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
fantastic things that people are doing

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,080
so

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,600
uh it's been it's been a great

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,919
experience i'm very happy to

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,800
to to you know to have been able to do

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
it and uh

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,080
and it's yeah it's continuing it's i'm

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
on my

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,080
11th term now and i still still enjoy it

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,600
but really it's a

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,120
it's about learning it's about

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
interacting with people

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
that's uh that's where i think you can

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
yeah hopefully do a good job in doing

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,240
that

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,960
um and i wanted to to to

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,919
show you what has happened uh in my

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,919
career

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,320
um and and a lot of it or most of it is

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,280
is directly linked to open source

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,960
actually

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,280
um i became a grandpa a month ago so i'm

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
i'm not that young anymore i'm not that

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,759
old either

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
i think but still you know i've been

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,039
doing i've been around for a while

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,759
um and my so if you look on this

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,360
timeline

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,919
it starts in 1998 i was working for the

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,240
swiss

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,280
uh government at the time federal

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
chancellory

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,600
and they accepted you know i was working

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,639
for them as an independent consultant

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,639
and they allowed me to create my module

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
as an open source project it was this

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,880
rtf

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
j4 rtf generating module to generate

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
semi-finished documents and it was

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
fantastic i think probably they didn't

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
have

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
some some clear rules at the time of

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
whether it was allowed or not

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
because it was very early so i said yeah

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,639
okay that's fine you can do it so i put

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,199
my project up on the sourceforge at the

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,360
time

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,120
and then it was noticed by janugu or

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
abelino from apache say but

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,319
oh maybe you want to donate that to to

00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,759
apache fop

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
it looks like it could be useful so

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,360
that's how how i got started

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,360
and then i was already i've been doing

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,039
working around content management pretty

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,240
much all my career

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,160
uh so i was doing that and i noticed

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800
apache cocoon which was a great

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,160
framework to create dynamic websites

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
uh in the early 2000s it's not that

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
popular today but

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,080
uh it still works fine and it at the

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
time it was a very innovative framework

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,440
to do uh

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
to do you know dynamic websites and open

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,600
source an apache project

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,880
i mean cocoon was a very nice community

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,960
in these these times

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
it's probably still a good community but

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,800
it's less active today

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,240
but at the time it was all people from

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
small companies

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
and we were all doing business with

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,160
cocoon on

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,720
on our own small scale which meant that

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,319
we we

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
really needed to work and we were very

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
enthusiastic about it level it was

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,720
a great experience then i became a

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,240
member of the apache software foundation

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,199
around 2003 and then this nouveau this

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
this yellow thing here it's a website

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,840
that i did for the swiss television

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,319
and it's interesting because it it the

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
people

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,400
who working on this project found out

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,240
that uh cocoon was a good tool to do

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,880
that and they say okay we need to find

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,280
someone

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,960
who who knows a cocoon and they look at

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
the list of contributors lists of

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
committers

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
and there's my name bertrand lagreta

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,919
this guy must be from around here

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,759
with a name like that so they called me

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
and i got work and you know i started to

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,360
work for them for

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
i think for about five years five six

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,080
years i i worked for them and this was

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,720
directly related to cocoon you know so

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
yeah open source played a key role as my

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,240
marketing i would say

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,759
as an independent then i got hired by

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
day software small company in

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,960
switzerland doing content management

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
products in 2007 also via the activities

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
in open source

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,599
because i had met their cto at an apache

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
conference

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,720
and you know we already knew each other

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,479
so it was much easier to

00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
to hire me that's someone that you you

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,919
don't know at all

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,919
then 2008 i already mentioned both the

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,720
directors made a big difference

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,360
about learning things and meeting people

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,680
and then

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,879
day software got acquired by adobe in

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,720
because adobe adobe.com was running on

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,280
our products as you know we might as

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
well

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,479
buy the company and now it's as i said

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,000
adobe experience manager

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,240
and then i've also been involved in the

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,680
apache incubator which i find it is a

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
great way you know to bring

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
bring your products and you your people

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,360
in apache

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,880
so really open source has played a key

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
role in my career

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,360
uh the graph that you see here is the

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,159
evolution of the share price of day

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,039
software so it went pretty well you know

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,800
that doesn't say

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,320
everything about the company but still

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,360
meant that you know the company was

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
doing fine and

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,279
this software was really based on open

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,240
source software and in the adobe product

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
that i'm working on

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,600
experience manager i would say 90 of the

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
of the critical stuff is is uh open

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,720
source apache projects so still a strong

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
uh relationship to that it's not because

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
i want to to

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,880
you know push me to both to to boast

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,959
about this

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
but i think it shows that you know you

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,720
can build a solid career on

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,680
on around open source and i think that's

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,440
great so open source has changed my

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,000
world in my professional

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,320
world through all these experiences

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,399
um second point that i want to make is

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,240
that open source is everywhere

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
of course we as programmers might

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,640
realize that more

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,080
than the the general public but uh you

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,480
know when you talk to people and you

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,160
want

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,680
to convince them that open source is

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
something serious you can say

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,080
you know open source is in your fridge

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,120
if you have a kind of one of these

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,720
modern fridge

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,560
fridges there's certainly some open

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
source software that that's

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,600
involved in that in your computer that's

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,720
obvious even

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,880
this picture shows a an apple mac but

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,080
even though mac is a commercial product

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,560
the darwin

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,839
the the core operating software is is

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,640
open source

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
uh the electric car on the top right uh

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,279
certainly has some open source control

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
software

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,360
inside it your bank might run on open

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,839
source there's a finer act

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
track in apache con so you know software

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,320
to create

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,200
micro financing or or digital banks

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,120
so that's uh banks our software today so

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,600
i'm sure they have a lot of open source

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,160
the drill the electric drill is maybe a

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
bit

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
on the edge but i'm sure that if you

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
look at the supply chain or the

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,240
the design software that's used to build

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,279
these tools there is there is open

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,800
source

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,399
the nice building that you see on the

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,320
right is the swiss parliament i

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
i wouldn't mention that because so i

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,519
used to work for them

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,200
uh 20 something years ago as a

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,079
consultant and we did lots of stuff

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,560
based on

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,720
based on open source i used one of the

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
very first java web frameworks called

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,160
anhydra

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,440
to do a website from them in 1997 so it

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,600
was pretty innovative

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,720
and again based on open source and we'll

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,240
see another thing

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,160
later in the slides about this

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,760
parliament which is interesting in terms

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,800
of collaboration methods

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,800
and the tax software i have a story

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,600
about that uh so in switzerland we have

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,560
i used to to live in canton de vo uh the

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
old davao

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
uh county or state and they have a

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,240
software called vote tax which allows

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
you to do your your taxes

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
and when i got this i looked you know

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,079
kind of hacked

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,640
not acted but reverse engineered it to

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,480
see what's

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
what was inside and they were using

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,640
apache form so i looked if they had

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,320
you know the the credits if they were

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,640
giving credits to apache

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
which you need to do and they didn't so

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
i wrote to the

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,880
to the tax office and i got an answer

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,720
within one hour

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,959
which is very fast for that type of

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,880
organization from someone who was a bit

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,200
embarrassed say yeah you know we

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,399
already have distributed 200 000 copies

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,800
of the software

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,480
and we forgot as you said rightly said

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,079
we forgot to put the apache

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
credit for the apache software what

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,240
shall we do do we owe you money

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
and then we we said you know the assets

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,279
said no you don't but please fix that

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,880
for next time

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,720
so people were using open source

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,800
software without realizing that

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,639
there might be some strengths attached

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,680
some things that you need to to respect

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,200
when you use it

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,360
but really the point i want to make is

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
that open source is everywhere and it

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,320
you could say it runs a large part of

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,240
our of our world today

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,760
and i'm not the only one saying it here

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,639
you see uh

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,200
you know a few quotes on the on the left

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,320
you have

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,240
us hersley from google

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,839
who's another swiss guy and he says

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,760
open source software has changed

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,320
everything you know and this is

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,639
google's you know this is one of the top

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
people from google speaking so

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,560
you could say google is not the more the

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
most open company

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,480
but you know they say open source

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,240
software has changed everything and they

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,720
are very active in open source

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
even though their products have are very

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,000
commercial

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,279
so yeah google says open source software

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
has changed everything

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,480
top right we have you have justin aaron

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
krantz who a

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,160
fellow apache member who was president

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,240
of the foundation

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,000
a few years ago and says you know i mean

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
i'm in a taxi i mean a

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,079
cab and the driver has this car heads-up

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,600
display and there's a menu that says

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,079
open source software

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,440
we have one you know really yeah open

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,959
source is everywhere

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,959
and then you have the i think the

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,120
microsoft store is also interesting

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,639
in 2001 you have steve ballmer saying

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,279
linux is a cancer

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,560
which contaminates software with hippy

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,959
gpl rubbish

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,200
and then 2019 you have microsoft

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,120
contributing to open jdk and later

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,480
they go on to buy github and so on so

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,480
they have really

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,680
changed their mind about open source so

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
it's you know

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,360
more examples that open source is really

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
everywhere and is making a big

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,240
difference

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
for for those huge companies

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,959
so the i think yeah we can really say

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,920
today the hippie gpr rubbish

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,480
is over if not that it ever existed but

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,880
uh

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,040
you know to to put to kind of make a

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,000
turn on that on that statement

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
um open source is today's powers things

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
and they

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
saw the the romantic view of the open

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,320
source geeks i think is not really

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,320
valid anymore today

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,000
and it's really open source communities

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,800
that make the difference we put a lot of

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
emphasis

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
on on communities in the apache software

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,240
foundation and i think that's a

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,399
that's really good thing that's really

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,600
important um

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,079
so i suppose there's many people in this

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,519
in the audience who know what apache is

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,440
but if you need to make the point to

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
someone else that could be useful

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,680
apache is a neutral space we sometimes

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,079
say jokingly it's a switzerland of open

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,519
source but i think it does apply

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,519
in many ways um and it's meant for indep

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,160
independent projects projects which are

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,959
independent

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
from organizations from companies where

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,639
it's really individuals

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,720
are getting together and apache provides

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,760
a space for these projects to prosper

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
and create

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,600
apache doesn't have a technical strategy

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
for example but we provide space

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,839
and we let the the projects flourish to

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,760
do what they do

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
you know what they do best and the goal

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,880
is to produce open source software for

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
the public good

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
it's really you know it's really the

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,320
basics of apache

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
explains many things uh about how we

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,560
work and our fierce

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,760
independence and all these things and

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
the last line

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
it's based on the commercial friendly

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
apache 2-0 license

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,399
so again going to the to the hippie uh

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:32,320
uh image uh we are business folks

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,880
you know we we we interact within apache

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,440
as neutral independent volunteers

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,079
but the results are meant to be used in

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,000
business

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,560
and we'll see that this this works

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,720
pretty well so i think that makes uh

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,920
apache kind of a fairly unique

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
organization

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,240
and and i think it's good to go back to

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,320
these basic principles when we

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,360
disagree on things and or when we have

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,440
to to

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,440
reflect on on what it is that we do

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,480
um i was i was thinking when i when i

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,279
was reviewing my slides yesterday i was

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,680
thinking that this

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,240
would be duplicated with the state of

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
the feather address that that david

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,120
nelly our president did

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,759
a few hours ago but it's not because

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,279
david

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,920
i think david in the end didn't show any

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,000
statistics so it's also good to reflect

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,480
on the size of apache

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,079
these numbers are from last year so

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,759
they're already you know we're already

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,720
over that but

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,560
and the order of magnitude you know more

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,759
than 6 000 kilometers

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,079
more than 700 members 200 pmcs

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,959
50 around 50 per links all the time in

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,880
the incubator

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,199
and you see the the statistics here

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,120
which where it's really growing it's a

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,240
it's a solid thing today

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,120
around 300 projects 50 in the incubator

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,079
and lots lots going on all the time so i

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
think that's a

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,079
you know that's a very important thing

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
and we have to take care of it

00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,160
so that it continues for yeah 50 years

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,360
or more as we often say

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,679
and so uh as i said for us

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
community is at the core community over

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,400
code

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,000
uh you probably know this uh statement

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,760
the the idea is that

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,079
if you have bad code and a good

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,919
community the code will get better

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,600
if you have great code and a community

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,640
where people argue and fight all the

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,439
time it will

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,760
you know entropy will will jump in and

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,039
the

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,039
the project will get worse or disappear

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,960
so it's really we we paid a lot of

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,320
attention on our communities to nurture

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,799
them to make sure they're

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:38,880
they're solid and you know work well

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,200
um and one thing that that

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,760
people sometimes find surprising is that

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,320
apache runs without meetings

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
and david was mentioning in the state of

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,559
the federal address how

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,600
it's it's impressive how apache has

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,919
continued

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,200
despite the kovi the pandemic you know

00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,280
it's been now

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
seven or eight months that we've been uh

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,720
we've been

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,480
uh you know we had problems with that

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,440
which is limiting us in many ways but

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,960
apache is just

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,559
going around you know our projects are

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,600
still working because we

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,320
we don't have meetings anyway we okay if

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,120
we can travel

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,640
at school but if we can't we can be uh

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,400
as efficient

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
and that's that's a very nice thing and

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
that i think that's one of the ways in

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,960
which open source is

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,280
changing the world in in inventing or

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,160
refining these techniques to work

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,360
asynchronously to work remotely and we

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,960
you know for us it's

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,200
it's the day-to-day we're totally used

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,200
to doing that and i think we can help

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,039
our our communities in teaching them to

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,039
do that i don't know if it's

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,960
how it is in other countries but in

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,240
switzerland during kovit we have lots of

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,240
experts

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,400
or so-called experts talking about that

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
on the news and say yeah you know

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,559
people are doing remote work so they're

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
using video conferencing all day

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,640
and then they get tired and it's not

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,799
efficient and we say of course you know

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
remote working is not reproducing the

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,600
office at home

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,600
it's working in a different way and

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,760
we're used to that so maybe we could

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,720
could teach you that or you know explain

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
how we work

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,360
and one one aspect or yeah is that

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,840
meetings are extremely expensive as well

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,080
so okay now with code maybe you can't do

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,520
meetings so that that problem is solved

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,520
but when when we go back to to more

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,200
you know being able to travel more i'm

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,520
sure people will start doing

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
too many meetings again and maybe you

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,640
can help them

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
yeah you find a balance in that

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
this is this statement is from a very

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,200
nice blog post by paul graham

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
called the make a schedule manager

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
schedule i invite you to read it you

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
have the link here on this slide

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,919
uh in a maker schedule the half hour you

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,799
know if you have a meeting in the

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,960
afternoon you can

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,880
it can ruin the whole afternoon because

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
before the meeting you think about it

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,799
you don't start something because you

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,799
you won't be able to finish it

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,000
and and you know i think it's really

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,200
something that

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,960
meetings uh are very different the

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,320
impact of a meeting on your schedule is

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,360
very different if you're on make a

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,440
schedule

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,200
or on a manager's schedule a manager if

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,280
you're if if your work is to be in

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,440
meetings then if you have one more

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,520
it's one more hour if you're in a make a

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,240
schedule you're creating you're crafting

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,000
things

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,080
uh you have to be very careful on where

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
you where you allow meetings in your

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,120
in your schedule so that's something i

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,360
think also where the

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
yeah the open source world is can be

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
leading because we

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,679
we used to work without meetings or with

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,799
a minimal amount of them

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,400
uh we all have you know uh you

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,000
you know all the examples of failed

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,919
meetings if you search for fun

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,840
videos about failed meetings on the web

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,840
you'll find ton of tons of them

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,600
forgot to invite someone you know it's

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,159
unclear what the goal is

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
uh nobody's making decisions people are

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,120
not prepared

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
so uh you know there's many ways in

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,840
which meetings can fail so if you have a

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,559
working technique that does not rely on

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,480
meetings

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,240
i think it's very efficient and then

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,840
when you can have meetings it's great

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,600
for brainstorming for

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
you know discussions uh it's it's

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,559
fantastic but if

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,039
they are not the backbone of your

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,799
collaboration make things much easier

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
and that's where you can take uh you

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,799
know examples from the open source

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,240
world uh and one the way we solve this

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,679
in in the open source

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,320
communities is with two main tools i

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,320
would say

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,919
i don't care exactly what which tools

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,679
they are but

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,280
i think it's the type of tool that's

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,760
important on the left you have

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,400
a shared and sa asynchronous broadcast

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,960
channel

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,240
taking the example from marine radio if

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,080
you're if you use a

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:39,360
marine radio at least in europe you use

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,280
channel 16 to call and you use this as

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,400
little as possible because it will get

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,919
crowded otherwise

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,000
and then you switch to another channel

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,919
to have a to have the discussion that

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
you want to have with with the you know

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,240
the port authorities or the coast guard

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,559
or

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,080
anyone and and i think it's a similar

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,600
model works well in open source and

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,559
that's what we're doing you know in our

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,000
projects

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,000
uh we the apache projects usually have a

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,840
dev mailing list development mailing

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,320
list where you discuss the broadcast

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,200
things

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,440
and then you will switch out to to

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,520
tickets to jira or get tickets

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,799
for for the details and that that works

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,280
very well oh

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,679
i'll see that for uh i left some french

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,520
commentary here the last version of that

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,080
of those slides were in french so i'll

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,960
let i'll let you translate yeah

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,880
the the on the left it says disorganized

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,440
and noisy on the right it says

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
structured and chronological you know a

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
time based

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,440
so the the tool on the left is a shared

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,280
case management tool

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
where you can go deeper in the cases

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,080
that you have to get your

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,280
handling be it a new feature or a bug or

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
something that you want to do on your

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,400
own

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,480
on your project's website or whatever it

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
could be as simple as index cards if

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,000
you're co-located

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,840
or but you know of course you know in

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,400
our digital worlds we use

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,440
digital world we use tools like like

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,039
ticket management

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,760
jira or or bugzilla or git or whatever

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,360
works

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,440
but i think it's important to focus on

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,919
the on the tool families

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,440
asynchronous communications channel and

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,360
case management tool to go into the

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
details i have another presentation on

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,600
this

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
uh you have the link here that i did

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,440
that first them other the other one from

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
first backstage

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,520
recording is better i also did that at

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,080
first them a while ago so this is

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,200
on on the really the asynchronous

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,039
decisions

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,960
and i don't know if the open source

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,520
communities have invented this probably

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,080
not

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,520
but we have refined it to a point where

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
it's out there today and it's very

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,440
efficient and i think that's one way in

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,600
which open source changes the world

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,559
by you know refining these techniques

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,679
and making them

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,360
available to to anyone for any you know

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,640
i think it can work for any project

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
doesn't have to be software

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
um so this is the the structure of the

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,760
apache

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
software foundation the administrative

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,559
structure if you would say

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,559
so every project has a has a vp uh

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,159
vice president who's in charge of

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,720
interacting between the board of the

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,799
project

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,240
and the project they don't have in

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,880
general they don't have any special

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,679
power

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,159
they're more here as a liaison and then

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,679
we have

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,240
the vps for different administrative

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,080
tasks like fundraising travel assistance

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,760
marketing publicity infrastructure and

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,720
so on then you have the board of

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,039
directors

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,640
it really looks like you know a

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,559
medium-sized company and

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,360
which is which is what it is in the end

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,480
with you would say with 6 000

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,080
employees if you would transpose that to

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,159
a commercial entity

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,799
and the thing is as i said it works

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,840
without meetings or very few meetings

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,880
the board of directors has a monthly

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,799
call uh video conference today

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,720
and actually this is this has been

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,039
getting shorter this year

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,960
because we have started to do even more

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,679
asynchronous work in the in the board of

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
directors

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,039
so the last meetings have been around 30

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,760
to 45 minutes

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,080
per month so it's not a long time you

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,640
know

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,480
to to a long meeting time to to make

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,640
such an organization work

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,400
so i think it shows the power of this

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,400
remote asynchronous collaboration

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,840
and i mentioned the swiss federal

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,919
council it's very interesting

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,840
so i worked for these people uh more

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,240
than 20 years ago and

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,360
it took me a long time to realize that

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
they actually work

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,520
in a very similar way to the apache

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,039
board of directors in terms of

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,799
organizing their meetings

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,240
actually wrote the software that they

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,400
used to do the agenda

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,760
for their meetings at the time using

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,559
this anhydrous

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,000
java framework that i mentioned but i

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,320
didn't realize

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
until like three four years ago that

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,200
it's very similar to

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,640
to how we work in the in the board of

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,279
directors in our and

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,760
in our projects the thing that they do

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
um

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,200
i think it's interesting because it

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,760
shows that these techniques can work

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,799
without

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,080
complex digital tools and the the tools

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,400
the the key tools

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,840
they have to organize their session so

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,880
they they have a

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,600
weekly session of about three four hours

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,320
where they all get together and they

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
make about

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,159
80 decisions in these three four hours

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,679
and that's a lot

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,520
you know if you had to discuss every

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
decision it would never work it has to

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
be organized

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,320
prepared lots of preparation before the

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,960
meeting

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,039
because they did these are very busy and

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
very expensive you could say

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,080
people so the way they work is they have

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,559
color-coded lists for their agenda

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,799
they have an orange list which contains

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,600
as they say uncontested items of

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,679
business

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,960
which means i suppose the way it work is

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,159
that the the

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,000
the the president says okay on the page

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,279
one of the orange list we have

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,080
uh 12 items which we know we agree on

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,559
can can we

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,159
accept this in bulk and then you know it

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,240
takes two minutes and you have 12

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,919
12 decisions are made because they've

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,080
been prepared in advance

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,159
then the blue list is responses to

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,799
parliamentary requests so where they

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,360
might

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,960
need a bit of discussion to agree on the

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
answer that they will give takes a bit

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,360
more time

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,039
then the white lists are items that are

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,679
very important politically so

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,120
they are discussed one by one probably

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,600
takes a long time

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,640
or not necessarily a long time but more

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,480
time

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
and you know the way it's organized if

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
you if you can't get to the end of the

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,559
white list at least you have

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
finished all the other ones so you maybe

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,120
you you only do

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,640
76 decisions instead of 80 but you

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,080
you're not blocked by something that

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,600
takes a long time because it's on the

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,440
white list and you take this

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,600
after the others or you know you

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
prioritize so it's very efficient and

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,080
then the last list the green list

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,760
is confidential items of business where

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,440
maybe some people need need to leave the

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,320
room or something like that

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,159
so my point is that by preparing a

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,440
meeting like that in advance and that's

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,520
a lot of work that's

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,279
i don't know it's maybe 100 people who

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,720
are involved in in preparing this

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,880
meeting from the various

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,120
departments of the government but then

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,240
it allows these very busy people to

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,039
take uh ratify 80 decisions in three

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,120
four hours

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,960
and it's very interesting because again

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,240
it's quite similar to the way we work in

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,080
the board of directors

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,760
both of directors we have an agenda

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,559
which is a single text file in version

00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,399
control

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,799
but it's it's you know there's lots of

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,720
parallels and my point is that

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,000
yeah it's interesting to see the the

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,240
palace between

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
these very different worlds using same

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,640
techniques to be

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,960
efficient and uh you know to work in in

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,440
an

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
in a hybrid way this meeting from the

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,200
swiss federal council

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,799
is not completely asynchronous uh

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,720
there's a big part that happens

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,720
asynchronously before the meeting and

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,840
then the synchronous portion can be very

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,360
efficient

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,120
because of that and i think we can do

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,799
the same in our projects and we

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,120
we're actually very often doing that in

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,480
open source

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,559
so really i think open source

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,679
communities make the difference in this

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,320
world change

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,279
that i was i was mentioning by by you

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,760
know refining

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,399
the refining these techniques explaining

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,480
them

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,919
and sometimes creating tools that make

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,120
it easier to work

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,039
with these uh with these techniques i

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,000
also mentioned that i think open source

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,919
is also changing

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,279
the business world so how about that

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,200
if you look at for example the

00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,840
statistics of the public service on the

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,320
internet

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,000
those statistics are very hard to make

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,240
because what

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,080
you know now today with everything being

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,200
virtual and containers and virtual

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,520
machines and stuff

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,720
it's very hard to together get a

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
realistic figure

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,559
but if you look uh this is from

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,679
wikipedia again from last year i think

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,720
um it's between 35 and 96

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,200
of servers on the web which are linux so

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
you know

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:50,640
even one of the open source uh systems

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,640
is at least 35 or at best 96

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,640
depending on how you count so it's you

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,919
know it's a big part of the web

00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,440
that runs on on open source uh top right

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,240
you have the um

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,399
the web server software uh and between

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,720
apache and nginx according to this

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,399
statistic to this net craft statistic

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,440
it's 51 percent so again a very uh

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,559
high percentage of open source in these

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,600
in these servers which make the world

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,919
and make the business

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,360
run you know so it is very important

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,399
part on the bottom

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,159
left i have an article from reuters plus

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,640
on the hadoop market in 2018.

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,399
so yeah no probably strange today but to

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,279
to you know hadoop was

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,279
a market that started from nothing and

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,760
got to in 2018 was a

00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,919
1700 million dollar market and growing

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,200
so uh even if it i don't know if it's

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,080
still as popular today

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,640
those things are often changing but we

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,799
see that some of our projects

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,960
from apache and from other organizations

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,520
have really created businesses and

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,240
created

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,080
industries on a fairly you know fairly

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,080
big scale so i would say that's

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,320
that's part of my statement that that

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,480
open source changes the world it changes

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,880
the business world as well and in this

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,840
way i think the apache software license

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,519
is fantastic

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,000
because of this of its business

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,840
friendliness one of its clarity

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,440
you know between what's what's the open

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,679
source free stuff

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,840
and what's how you can do business with

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,840
it

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,279
another way in which open source makes a

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,440
difference is in

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,799
talent discovery and hiring you're

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,120
probably aware of the

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,399
the student programs which are around

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,480
open source

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,760
google summer of code might be the the

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,440
most well known

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,360
and every year you have thousands of

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,919
students which are involved in this

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,760
program

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,159
and can get in touch with open source

00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,279
projects i know personally some of them

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,799
who got jobs

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,880
at google at uh typesafe and you know so

00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,919
some serious companies coming from

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,000
countries where it

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,559
might be harder to get a job because

00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,279
they were good and they you know they

00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,600
could start showing their talents in an

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,200
open source projects via these programs

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,720
and i think that that makes also a

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,279
difference in the world in this

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,200
these people's lives and today also if

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,640
you look at the on the right the github

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,360
statistics on a project

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,799
you can learn a lot about someone oh

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,799
smarter clayton this

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,440
person has been you know very active in

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,320
this project from 2015

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,640
a bit less after that and then you can

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,799
look at their code and see you know

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,399
or in your if you're on the same project

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,039
you will know how they interact with

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,880
people

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,240
and it's much easier to make a hiring

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,640
decision based on that

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,640
so i think that's also one angle where

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,039
where open source makes a big difference

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,880
in business in people's lives through

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:45,600
you know helping them get good jobs

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,840
and and all that so to conclude

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,080
i have three um key points that i wanted

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,919
to make so open source is everywhere

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,519
as we said in your fridge and your

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,720
electric bike and your

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,279
cd player and your phone uh you know

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,320
if we turned off open source today with

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,159
in trouble

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,760
i think it might it would be even worse

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,440
than kobe

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,799
and open source communities make the

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,279
difference you know we

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,200
we have developed some very nice

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,240
techniques of collaboration in the

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,840
communities

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,600
asynchronous work interacting in writing

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,880
you know in decent way trying to be

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,559
diverse trying to be

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,200
egalitarian and so on so i think that

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,880
can have a big impact on people's lives

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,720
and the way people do business or the

00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,159
way people run projects

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,000
and open source is also good for

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,760
business we've seen that it powers

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,960
a large part of the internet it powers

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,880
some industries it creates some industry

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,960
sometimes so i think we can really be

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,519
proud to be to be involved in open

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,760
source

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,200
if you're starting up i encourage you to

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,279
you know continue

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,039
and learn more and be more involved in

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,799
projects in conferences

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,559
and that that will be will be very

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,279
useful and i hope these uh

00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,159
these this presentation can kind of help

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,000
you

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,919
you know make points to convince people

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,360
or explain to your family what it is

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,880
that you're doing you know

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,000
sitting in the evening in front of a

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,000
camera and talking to people what's that

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,919
i think you know it can be helpful for

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,480
us to be able to better explain what we

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,560
do

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,159
so i hope this uh this presentation has

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,040
been has been useful

00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,760
um i can stay in the if you have

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,839
questions

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,200
you can ask them in the chat now and i

00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,960
can save a few minutes

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,200
or i'll be around the conference and uh

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,879
um yeah you have my twitter handle at

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,599
the bottom of this slide speed like i

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,639
die

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,280
you probably have to copy paste it but

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,040
that's a good way to to reach me thank

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,240
thank you for being here and i hope this

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,560
has been useful

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,520
and uh the community track is continuing

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,520
so you can i think

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,960
it's probably daniel rojeri who's next

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,480
so i encourage you to

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,760
follow this session thank you thank you

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,520
thank you very much so um

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,800
if you have any questions of vertron

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,720
then please uh

00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,760
type them in the chat and if

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,240
and so we can relay that to him if you

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,480
uh haven't got any any any questions

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,079
then as veteran mentions he will be

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,240
around conference and we can maybe

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,920
uh catch up with him a bit later if you

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,839
think of something that you want to

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,839
want to ask

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,640
so it looks like there's no question no

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,800
immediate questions but

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,040
oh thanks kevin

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,560
yeah we sell something something that's

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,800
what we do and sometimes

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
sometimes the quality is not much better

00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,280
than the gobbled

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,880
ship radio which makes you know makes it

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,359
a challenge to communicate thank you

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:53,040
okay nice so if we if we don't have any

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,720
any other questions then oh here oh

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
we've got something here we go from adam

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,520
taylor

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,240
what's a good project to start with if

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,280
i've never done any open source

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,920
i think a good project is one that you

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
need

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,960
you know find something that i don't

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,520
know if you're into

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,079
music find a find a project that does

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,160
music

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
or you know find something that's one of

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,200
your hobbies

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,960
or that you need for your work i think

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,320
that that's where where you'll be really

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,119
motivated

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,079
um to to to do something and then you

00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,119
have to look at the

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,280
the project's community you know try to

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,040

uh are they nice to each other or can

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,800

can they respectfully disagree and and

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,599
all these things but

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200

that's useful to you and then that's

00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,000
that's when you

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:46,720
