	How to help companies be the best open source participants possible
Stormy Peters

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Companies are participating more and more in open source. Projects that figure out how to work most effectively with companies will benefit the most while maintaining their autonomy. Come discuss and learn the best ways to include companies in your open source software plans. Learn how to leverage the resources companies can bring to a project while maintaining your project's governance model. Learn how to keep companies in the loop and still hear all the individual voices. Learn how to accept resources without sacrificing autonomy. The speaker is experienced in both running Open Source Programs Office for large companies as well as leading open source software non-profits. This unique perspective to both sides allows her to bring some novel suggestions. Many of us have experience working with open source software projects and companies. This presentation will be a mix of real examples and audience discussion.

session i hope is a conversation

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
i was really hoping it would be a

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,800
conversation um in person

anytime you'd like um you can drop them

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,520
in chat i'll try to

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,039
take a break every couple slides and

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
look at what's in chat but i'm not very

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,719
good at reading and talking

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,480
and listening at the same time um so

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,800
feel free to just jump in

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,520
um i wanted to have a conversation about

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
how we can

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
best help companies um be good

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,120
participants

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,399
in the open source software world um

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,879
just a little bit of background on

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,920
myself

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,119
i've spent my entire 20-year career in

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
open source software

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,799
i'm bridging the gap between companies

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,880
and open source software

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
so at hewlett packard i started the one

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,439
of the very first open source programs

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,960
offices

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,320
um i went on to work at a number of

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
nonprofits and with a number of

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,720
communities

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,720
and i've always kind of bridged the gap

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,479
between helping companies figure out how

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,960
to work with open source software

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,479
and figure helping nonprofits figure out

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,799
how to

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
ask companies for for help or for money

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,680
or to work better with them

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,119
so i thought this would be a great thing

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
to discuss together because i'm sure a

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,439
lot of you are in the same boat

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
um and so let's let's have a

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,560
conversation

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,200
um let's see what we know as a group um

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
i just

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
put together a bunch of um just general

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,520
topic slides and i can talk to

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,040
any of them for a while um but you're

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
also welcome to jump in

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
um so one of the very first things i

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,960
think is really important when you're

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,960
trying to get

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,200
a company to get involved in your

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,560
project is to be really clear what your

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
governance model is

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
um because especially to to people that

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,479
are new to open source software

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,000
and then to their entire management

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,440
chain and the other people in the

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
company that have never heard of open

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,440
source software

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
how and why people work on open source

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
software is really confusing to them

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
so i think it's really important to be

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
clear about how you make decisions

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
who the decision makers are who they

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
should go to if they have questions

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
like just being really clear about how

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,440
things work

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,680
um so they can convince their management

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,720
or their peers that this is like

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
something they can work with any any

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,680
thoughts on that or anything anyone

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,200
else wants to share if everyone wouldn't

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,879
mind dropping in chat like

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
your name and what your role is or you

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,840
do work for a project for a company

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
which which part of this

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,519
conversation do you want to be a part of

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,319
um that'd be a great way to get started

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,920
see if you see

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,440
on the right there's like a chat and

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
there's like an event chat and a session

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,840
chat

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
you can jump it drop in the session chat

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
like your name and what you're

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,519
interested in learning here that would

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
be awesome

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
so another topic that it comes up a lot

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,800
um whenever i talk about companies and

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,440
open source software is how to ask for

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
money

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
i think there's a lot of ways that

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,640
companies can participate in open source

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,360
software that's way beyond money

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,280
um with like people and resources and

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,280
and contributions in code

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,480
but i think it's important to point out

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
um

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,959
how to ask for money and and how to do

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,799
it well um so i i was just gonna spend a

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,879
few minutes talking about that

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
um first i think if you want money from

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,640
a company um

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
your ask needs to be really specific um

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,080
so you need to tell them

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,840
how much money you want so don't go and

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
say would you donate to my project

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
um i've had conferences come and say

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
would you would you sponsor our

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
our conference and it's like well for

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,000
how much and

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
what do we get so i think the first

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
thing is to be really specific

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
um about what it is that that you want

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,879
from the

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,159
the project like are you asking for five

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,280
thousand dollars are you asking for

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,120
fifty thousand

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,200
um and then i think it's really imp and

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
is it for a year or is it a one-time

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
thing um and then i think it's really

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
important to say like what they're going

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,439
to get out of it and you don't have to

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,560
give them the keys to the kingdom

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,080
you don't have to tell them that they

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,599
can run the project if you give them if

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
they give you a hundred thousand

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,400
um but you need to be clear about what

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
it is what are they going to get are

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
they going to get

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
um any kind of recognition are they

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,880
going to get a logo on your sponsor's

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
website

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,400
um are they going to get a vanity url in

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,199
your project

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,520
are they going like what what's in it

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,560
for

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,080
the company in the sense of like how are

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,680
they going to sell this to someone and

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,680
most likely if you're an open source

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,800
software project asking for money

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,919
um the easiest group for the person

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
that's trying to help you get money out

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
of their company

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
the easiest group for them to go to is

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,360
usually the marketing group

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,199
um so usually if you can give them any

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,800
kind of advertising recognition

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,199
um like logos or banners at conferences

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,960
that's really helpful the other thing

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,280
that people often give

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,240
is is an advisory board seat so usually

00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
a lot of projects have

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
a board of directors or a group of

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,199
maintainers who make decisions

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,720
and they often when they're starting to

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
look for for help from

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,400
financial help from companies they

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,400
create a board of advisors

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,479
um and companies are okay that the board

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,479
of advisors is not running the project

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,919
um you could perhaps give them um

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,120
responsibility for the money

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,720
since they're the ones donating the

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
money maybe if you donate ten thousand

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
dollars you get a seat on the advisory

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,639
board

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
um and you get to decide how the money

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,360
is spent in marketing

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
and that's probably actually helpful

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,720
because then you don't have to manage

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,120
that money or the conference is spent

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,000
um so an advisory board is something

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,039
often that peop

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,680
projects give um to help companies sell

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,120
to help their sponsors at companies um

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,440
sell the sponsorship within the company

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,400
um another thing i talked about logos

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,000
and brand um

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,600
placements another thing is conference

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
sponsorships um when i was executive

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
director of the genome foundation

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
i had one particular company that had a

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,440
really hard time sponsoring the gnome

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,440
foundation like it just

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,080
didn't fit in any kind of bucket they

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,759
had they couldn't just give us money

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
but they could give us lots of money for

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,400
gwadick which was our annual conference

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
still is the

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,560
annual conference um so they would

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,360
sponsor guadec at like a

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880
premium platinum plus level um in order

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,479
to help us throughout the year

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,000
um so a conference was something their

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,680
marketing group really understood

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
understood the value of was willing to

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,039
commit to

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,080
and thanks people for for dropping in

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,360
your your names and what you're

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,039
interested in the chat so i

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,560
encourage the rest of you to drop into

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,080
chat and uh just

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,720
introduce yourself and and what you're

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,639
interested in talking about here today

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
um the other thing with companies is

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
it's it's really hard

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,360
to get them to approve money the very

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
first time

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,440
um but if you can make that reoccurring

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,039
that's usually pretty easy because once

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,039
it's in the budget once

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,639
um it stays in the budget forever not

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,560
always but like

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,319
make your make your request reoccurring

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
so like make it an annual membership

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,400
or make it an annual conference

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,199
sponsorship um because it's much easier

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,520
to get

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
it to happen over and over again every

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,199
year

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
while you're on the topic of like

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,039
reoccurring things

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,520
companies have like really strange

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,039
fiscal budget years so

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
i worked at one company where the fiscal

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,560
year started in february not january but

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,319
february

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,759
i now work at microsoft where our fiscal

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
year starts in july

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,440
and we are like halfway through fiscal

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,000
year 2021 at this point

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
as confusing as that is and if if

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,240
projects can work with our fiscal year

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
that's much more helpful so like at

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,360
microsoft i'd much less

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,840
it's much harder for me to sponsor for

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
the year 2020 and much easier for me to

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,720
pay you

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,400
for a year that starts in july 2021 or

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,120
july 2020 because

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,759
that's actually my july 2021 in a weird

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,599
way

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,120
um so work with companies on when

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,560
they'll have budget and i actually

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
talked to someone who would keep track

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
of all the companies and when their

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,800
fiscal year started

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,479
and when it ended and a couple months

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
before the fiscal year ended he would

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
contact them and say

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,039
hey we're really looking for some extra

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,759
money was wondering if he had any left

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,080
in the budget

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,520
and he could often get you know 10 20k

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
from different companies

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,240
um because they still had money left in

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,800
the budget and their fiscal year was

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,800
about to end

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,479
and then give them things when you're

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
asking for money give them things that

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,919
they can share with their management so

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
tell them what you did with their money

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,360
um give them a if you're asking for a

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
conference sponsorship give them a

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
brochure like something that looks kind

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
of professional

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,199
with like the levels like give them

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,360
something that when they go ask their

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,280
management to their company or their

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,800
whoever their financial people in their

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,759
company give them something they can

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
show them

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,800
forward to them and say this is what i

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,560
want to sponsor

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,240
it's much easier for them if they can

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,760
show a nice brochure

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,440
than if it's just an email describing

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,719
how they want to give money to this

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,839
organization no one's ever heard of

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,640
within the company

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
any other any points anyone has about

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
money or asking for money

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,839
any difficulties you've had any

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:55,839
questions you'd like to ask

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
all right i see we have a question from

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
rich and he's interested in

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,320
understanding

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,760
um how to help companies that open

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
source understand the open source

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,519
software projects are not their projects

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
um are you talking about projects that

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,760
they've started or projects that they're

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,200
joining

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
you want to elaborate on that rich you

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
want to unbeat yourself

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,160
and i think rich is probably actually

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,080
really busy doing that actually i mute

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
myself because i'm the organizer

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
but you know when we deal with companies

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
at apache

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,279
that donate a project to the foundation

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,680
and then they want to keep the reins on

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,360
it

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,360
and you see this a lot with project with

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,959
companies that open source something

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,120
and then don't understand that it's not

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,279
theirs anymore so that was kind of

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
the situation and how to do that gently

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
so you're not stomping on them and

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
irritating them right because they just

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
donated something good and they really

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,519
want other people to participate so how

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
do you

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,880
get them to kind of take a step back so

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,360
that other people can play

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,959
um i think i run into that at microsoft

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
too and i actually think it's

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,800
they have a really good culture that

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,040
we're asking them to to change or

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,800
exchange for another good culture

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
um and it's really interesting so like

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,440
microsoft there's a really strong

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,480
culture of ownership for your code so if

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
i create a tool

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,839
that i'm using internally and it's super

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,240
useful and i put it out there

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,920
and 10 other teams start using it if any

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,760
of them have a problem with that tool

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
they're going to contact me and i'm

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,279
going to fix it because it's my code

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
and i'm responsible for it and i stand

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,519
behind it and they're not going to fix

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
it

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,279
because like it's my code and they

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
wouldn't want to step on my toes

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,120
and so when we move to like the inner

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
source open source model

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,399
we're trying to encourage those other

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
teams to just fix it and and to them it

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
feels a little bit like they're stepping

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,560
on someone's toes

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,000
and to the owner of the code like say if

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,920
it was me it feels a little bit like

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
they're intruding in my space

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,480
um so i think it's a cultural change to

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,920
explain to them that they have to like

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,920
give some room for others to to play

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,519
um i think it's a little bit like

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
raising kids too right like you have to

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
let them

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
make mistakes and do it wrong and to

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,240
kind of take a step back and let them

00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,839
play with it

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
um even though you could do it better or

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,440
faster or easier

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,640
so i think it's a lot of talking and

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
sharing and examples

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,839
anybody else have ideas for rich

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,839
or any other questions

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,640
yeah i think it's it's really important

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
to not not punish them for

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,320
for wanting to still own it but showing

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,000
them how other people would like to

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,760
play along um another area

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
that i think is really important is

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,320
updating the projects

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,480
um a lot of times from it

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,920
maybe if if there's already like 10

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
people from that company

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,279
involved and submitting code you know

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,160
doing pull release

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,680
pull requests and and submitting code

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,760
issues maybe they're super involved in

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,440
your project and they're following along

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,800
um but often it's usually only one or

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
two people from the company

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,839
involved in your project and then the

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
other people there's a lot of other

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,959
people in the company that are helping

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
get that sponsorship or helping get that

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,480
money

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
or helping promote it and they're not

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,760
really following along

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
um even though you've told them where

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
your mailing list is even though you

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,440
would expect that they would sign up for

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
your mailing list

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
even though you think they would go to

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
your repo once in a while and look at

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,399
the issues

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,000
they're not they're probably not um so

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,519
the more you can send them stuff even

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
though it's extra work the more you can

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
update them

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,279
um the better so if you can um send them

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,800
you know wrote road maps in the sense of

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,399
like not we're going to release this now

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,680
and this tomorrow and it's the next day

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,120
but kind of what you're working on and

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
what's important to you

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
if you could send them newsletters um if

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,880
you can compile like a weekly update of

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,320
what happened on the mailing list and

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
send that to them

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
if you can let them know that your

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,440
meeting got recorded

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,120
um like the stuff project records all of

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
its meetings and post them on youtube

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,560
just send them a little notice that says

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,320
hey the last five meetings are on

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,600
youtube if you want to follow along

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,600
last meeting we had a really great

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,519
discussion about this feature

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
or this problem that people were seeing

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
um the more you can like

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,560
update them the more engaged they'll end

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,639
up being and the more likely that

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,079
they'll continue to sponsor your project

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,079
and i think it's really hard because we

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,920
assume that obviously they would sign up

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,240
for the project

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
we have microsoft open source a project

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,519
called clearly defined

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
we have a lot of people that work on it

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,920
but the people that fiscally sponsor the

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,920
project inside microsoft are not

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
on the mailing lists and do not go to

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,560
the meetings um

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,920
so we have to make sure that you know we

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,360
meet with them every couple weeks and

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,120
tell them how the project's going

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,279
and and tell them what people are

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
working on and then let them know that

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
the the fiscal support that they're

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,959
offering is useful

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,480
um so i think it's really important to

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,519
do that to update them even when you

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,519
think it should be obvious

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,199
and then one thing i'd like to point out

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,560
in particular and i think i have it as a

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,959
whole topic later is

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,720
is security um so security is really

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,160
important to companies usually

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,680
and it's it's a little hard for them to

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,079
navigate in the open source software

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,399
world um so i think letting them know

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,519
how security updates happen pinging them

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,720
when there's issues assuming that

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
they're not following on the mailing

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,399
list

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
i think is super important

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,760
all right so i would normally pick on

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
people in the audience but i can't see

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
you

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,320
so if you want to join in and you want

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,240
to like ask a question

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,079
or you want to share an anecdote or if

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,399
something i say doesn't jive with you

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,560
and

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,440
you think i'm wrong like feel free to

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,959
jump in and

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,279
drop something in the chat and i'll read

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,120
it or if you if you cannot mute yourself

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,560
go ahead and do that um so so one of the

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,279
things that i think is is really

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,360
important

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,399
is to let companies know about

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,959
opportunities

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,560
um and and security is actually one that

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,480
that's happened quite a bit

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
um in my experience is that they're not

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,440
aware that there's like a team that

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,079
deals with security they're

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,760
not aware that there's a mailing list um

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,760
and and they would participate and they

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
would fix bugs and they you know issues

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
that came up and they would

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,320
share knowledge that they have from

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,839
within their organization and expertise

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
that they have across the organization

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,560
but they didn't even know

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
that that's how it happened i didn't

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,560
even know there was a security team

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,399
they could join um or they didn't know

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
that there was a weekly video call on

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,800
monday

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,720
or they would have joined every monday

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,320
because they're interested

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
or they don't know that there's a meetup

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
that happens or an annual conference

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,880
they should

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,839
have talked to so i i know a lot of

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,920
these things i'm saying

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,880
kind of reiterate on the same thing but

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,639
like

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,920
letting them know about opportunities

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,839
and spending like

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,760
half hour an hour a week just sending

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,199
out updates to your corporate

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,079
members like to um or ask the people in

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,199
your project hey

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,959
you know you work for

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,800
you know um auto company whatever

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,160
um are there people in in your company

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,000
that i should update that i could send

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,920
this newsletter to or here's the stuff

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,880
you could forward to them and let them

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
know what they could forward

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,000
and the other thing that i think um is

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,360
is often confusing to projects and

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,120
i would love um any input you have

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,800
on what advice we could give to

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,600
companies to make this better

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,959
is that often at a company um there's a

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,800
lot of switching of who works

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,320
on a project i've heard this feedback

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,800
about microsoft for example

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,560
um someone will join the project um

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,519
submit a pull request maybe two of the

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,600
poll requests

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,959
um respond to a couple issues and then

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,720
they'll just like disappear

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
and somebody else from the company will

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,120
show up and be the one

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,600
contributing next um and i know like in

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,240
microsoft's case we have often teams of

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,680
people

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
that are working on a project and

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,800
they'll try to rotate responsibilities

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
so that there's not a single point of

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,759
failure

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
um so there's a team of like 10 people

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,160
um and they depend on an apache project

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,839
for one thing they'll often not assign

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
one person to be delays on for that

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,639
apache project

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,720
they'll expect all 10 people on their

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,600
team to be able to fill in when it's

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,000
needed

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,600
um and so that person might rotate like

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
it and the person doesn't rotate but

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
it's just a different person

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,639
um the next time you come and i think

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
that's confusing to the projects and i

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,880
think it's hard on the company sometimes

00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
um but to expect that and just to treat

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,480
them

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,480
[Music]

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
you know treat these newcomers as people

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,520
that want to be part of the project um

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,319
so i i'd appreciate

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,679
um any advice or feedback you have on on

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,679
how to help companies do that better

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,959
and yeah rich it really gets in the way

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,760
of like

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,039
the the reputation you know the personal

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,520
reputation right like if

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,799
i you know who i am and you can trust me

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,640
if i've contributed

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,079
uh and if suddenly my colleague greg

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:33,840
shows up tomorrow like

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:33,840
how do you trust greg right um it's hard

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
any so for the new people coming in if

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,480
you could drop your name and what you're

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,679
interested in talking about and feel

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,640
free to join in

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,679
via chat or whoever um taking questions

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,520
throughout the session

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,480
and taking any input or comments that

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
other people have as well

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,600
and the next one i wanted to talk about

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,200
was just explaining things

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,280
especially when it comes to governance

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,559
or how things work i think it's not

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,760
always obvious to all companies um how

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,400
things

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
work and so taking a few extra minutes

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,360
to

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,919
explain it explaining who the key people

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,799
are

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
why they got started who they are what

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
their role in the project is

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,559
all the different places they might find

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
information um

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,760
all the different things that that might

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,039
be involved i think is

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,160
is really important um to

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,160
to welcoming any new person but in

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,320
specific a company and i would actually

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,760
um encourage everyone to write all this

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,640
out somewhere in their project in their

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,799
readme

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
or you know some somewhere obvious when

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,960
you get started in the project on your

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,760
web page

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
um how things in your project work and

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,280
how people can

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
expect to be involved and and how they

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,720
can

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,840
um and how they can grow or evolve to

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
that role so the other thing in

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
governance is

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,080
companies are often interested they're

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
willing i think they would be more

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,880
willing to invest

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,559
if it was clear where their investment

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
would go so if they said

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,080
okay we have to grow a single person we

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,520
can't rotate those 10 people

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,559
team through and get anywhere very

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,240
quickly um because it says right here

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,919
that and this is probably a little too

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
detailed but they have to submit ten

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,799
issues

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,640
and five pull requests and review 20

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,080
pull requests and then they get the next

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
level of maintainership

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,799
um that would encourage them to invest

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,240
one person's time in that project more

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,080
heavily

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,520
and if there's no obvious outcome to

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,720
investing a person they're probably

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,160
going to pull that person back to work

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,080
on other features that they need or

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,760
other things in their project

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,240
so the more clear you can be about how

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,559
things can work how governance works

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,760
who to reach out to and how people can

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,799
grow in your project

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,559
and maybe you don't have clear

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,919
you know rules like that like how much

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,000
you have to contribute but you could

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
give examples um you could give examples

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
of you know

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
rich works on apache and he did all of

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
these awesome things and then he

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
volunteered to be on the board of

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
directors and because of that

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
he you know he gets to run apache con

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
now um

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,919
like if you can point out examples of

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,840
how people grew into different roles

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
um that's also really helpful

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,960
any any examples people have or any

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,960
confusion they've run into there

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,320
okay the next one i said i had to have a

00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,840
slide on this um security is usually a

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
really big issue for companies

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,360
especially if they're shipping a product

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,320
that depends on your project um

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,880
and and i don't say they get touchy

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,280
about it but

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,720
they take it very seriously and what i

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
would encourage open source software

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
projects is to leverage that

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,520
because companies are willing to invest

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,600
a lot of people

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,679
and effort into making sure all of the

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,640
security problems are solved

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,200
for all of their dependencies and i've

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,080
been

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,440
really surprised so i i've worked in

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
open source at a number of companies

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,880
i've also helped

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,320
companies customers um so at red hat and

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,960
at microsoft i've helped

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,880
um customers understand how open source

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,559
software works and security

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,159
is it's not usually something they think

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,600
about and not usually something they

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
have any understanding of how it works

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,159
they

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,440
they just expect to be notified when

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,400
there's a security issue

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,440
and they don't realize that there's

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,280
another team that's probably been

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,120
working on this issue before

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,559
um the broad notice goes out like that

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,159
just doesn't seem to jive with how they

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,840
think open source software works

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,520
um so i think letting them know and i

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,799
think you'd often find they'd be willing

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
to put somebody on the security team

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,799
probably somebody with a lot of

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,240
experience

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,960
and somebody who would be a great asset

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,520
for the project um we also had the case

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,520
um this happened at microsoft we

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,960
security team very purposely we wanted

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,280
somebody on the security team for this

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
project it was a dependency we had

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,880
and that person left microsoft and in an

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,640
oversight

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
we didn't realize that we had lost our

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,760
person on the security team

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,039
which obviously we did that person might

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,880
even stayed on the security team but

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,320
they no longer worked at microsoft

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
um their role on the project was

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,159
independent of their job

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,760
and we would have we would have

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,880
nominated somebody else or requested

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,559
that somebody else be put on there we

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,240
would have put more resources on that

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,360
project security

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,360
team if we had known that um so i think

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
being really clear to companies how

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,640
security works

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,080
and feel free if you know someone on

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,320
your security team left the company

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,120
asking them for more resources i think

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,320
they'd often

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,240
be very receptive to that

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,440
any thoughts on security or any issues

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:29,039
that anyone has had around this

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,360
and the other thing i think that

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,799
projects could ask companies for is

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,360
customer requirements

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,400
um so it used to be um when open source

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,640
software was first

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,039
getting big most of us worked on a

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,559
project we were scratching our own itch

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,400
so we were working on a free and open

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
source software desktop and all of us

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,280
were using that free and open source

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
software desktop so when something was

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
wrong with it we saw it

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,919
when something was missing we noticed it

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,559
and and so we were

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,400
our own we gathered our own requirements

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,280
and we fixed our own problems

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,679
and these days with cloud software um

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,720
and

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,200
massive storage and solutions that run

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
across

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,480
you know many machines and many problem

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,960
sets it's not always

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,559
obvious what the the use case like not

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,760
the use case you know the use cases but

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,080
it's not always obvious

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,679
what problems or what features would be

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,000
what problems need to be fixed

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,760
or what features would be most helpful

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
and i think um

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,679
companies put people on you know

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,120
product management their full-time job

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,120
is to go out and talk

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,440
and to people and find out what they

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,960
need and they have people in sales who

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,080
are actively trying to sell their

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,919
product to

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,280
customers and hearing what it does and

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,039
doesn't do for them

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,400
they have people in support centers who

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,159
are taking calls

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,679
um hearing what doesn't work or what's

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,000
really hard to install

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,760
and i think asking them to share that

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
information in some form

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,279
um would be really helpful especially if

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,640
you're not the main product they're

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
shipping if you're a dependency that

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,039
they have

00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,400
i'm sure they'd be happy to share like

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,200
all the things they wish were different

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
or better

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,480
i mean you don't have to promise to fix

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,880
them um you could just ask them

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,679
to share that information and i think um

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,200
sigs

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,880
special interest groups are a really

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,960
good way to get multiple companies

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,360
together to share those requirements

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:18,000
or those problems or those issues those

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:20,559
pain points

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,279
then i i've talked a lot about how you

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,360
should share

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,559
with them how things are going and and

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,320
where things are going

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,840
um but i i think it's really important

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,880
to ask companies how things are going

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
and that's part of like getting the

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,520
requirements

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,480
um out of them is like ask them like

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,200
so you you've been lurking on our

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,120
mailing list

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,720
um how's it going are you are you using

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,880
our software um would you like to

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,159
participate do you know how

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,799
um do you feel like you're getting

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,400
information you need is there something

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,799
that i could provide or give you that

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,039
would help your management um sponsor us

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,960
like that would um so anything you can

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,200
you know feel free to ask them

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,640
what would help them help you and feel

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,240
free to ask them for things you need

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,960
like if your security team needs more

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
help

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
ask them if they'd be willing to do that

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,200
if your conference needs an organizer

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,559
um feel free to ask them that it's

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,919
bigger to ask

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,760
i don't know if you guys have heard the

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,039
the fundraising tip

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,200
that if you're trying to ask for money

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,000
you should ask really big first

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,039
and they did this experiment where they

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
had someone

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,080
go door-to-door in a neighborhood and

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
ask if

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,400
people would be willing to volunteer to

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,240
go spend a day at the zoo

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,760
with these kids that had gotten in

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,279
trouble or went to

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,679
school for for kids that had gotten in

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,159
trouble and they they were looking for

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,320
a full day volunteering from someone to

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,559
go to the zoo with these kids

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,600
and when they would ask that um most

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,320
people would say no

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,520
like they felt totally okay saying no to

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,880
a whole day ask

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,720
and then after they asked that they

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,159
would say oh okay well what would you

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,919
would you give ten dollars to pay for

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,200
one of the entry fees and then people

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,559
would give the ten dollars

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
easily because they just said no to this

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,159
really big ask so the small ask felt

00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,520
like they should do that

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
um whereas when they asked for the ten

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,320
dollars up front most people said no

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,159
to the ten dollars um they should ask

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,679
for a dollar or something at that point

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,720
so ask dream big ask big

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:15,360
and then when they say no ask smaller um

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,480
so i would with all with all fundraising

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,799
all corporate giving

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,080
i would do that i would ask big and then

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,559
have something in your back pocket to

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,480
ask for that smaller

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,159
um so rich says yeah it's hard at apache

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,840
oh we i got that one already

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,320
cool um and then i think the the key

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,440
thing is

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,000
is to work together um obviously these

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,080
people

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
that come from large companies are just

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,960
like me and you probably most of us are

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,480
paid

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
i don't know i'd be curious if we were

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
in a room i would say show my hands

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,440
how many people get paid to work on open

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,799
source software um

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
you get paid to work on open source

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,840
software like write me

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,840
in the chat

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,720
not me me i don't okay so that the

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,760
people that

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,840
that don't are you you but you do work

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,840
on open source software

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,240
so dave and sharon do you work on open

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,000
source software yep but you would like

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,000
to be paid

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
this conferences are great way to

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,960
network to find people that might have

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,919
jobs that would pay you to work on open

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,320
source software

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,440
um if you see something on the microsoft

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
jobs there's quite a few with open

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,520
source

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,960
let me know i'd be happy to try to do

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,080
introductions

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,760
um but work together um

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,200
assume they have good intentions even if

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,480
they rotate and they're random people

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,520
that just popped in

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
um i did i did hear a funny story um at

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,640
microsoft before i joined

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,159
that uh project figured out that

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,279
microsoft was going to start depending

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
on their project because

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,880
in mass like a whole bunch of microsoft

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,799
e's showed up at their conference

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,240
and they figured i figured that many

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,840
microsoft folks um

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,960
showed up at a project that they were

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,520
probably going to be using and

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,720
contributing to it soon and they did

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,559
cool i see that dave's mentoring

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,360
projects so any

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,880
any questions for me or anything that i

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,520
didn't cover that you would like to have

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,520
seen covered

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,080
so what's the biggest challenge to

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,480
getting a company to participate in your

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,480
project

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,480
or if you work at a company what's the

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
biggest challenge to getting your

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,360
company to sponsor your work or to

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,679
sponsor the project

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,679
bigger

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,760
anthem or christopher do you have

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
anything

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,039
all right i'm gonna i'm here for

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,640
questions i'm happy to share

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,159
any knowledge that i have about how to

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,360
get companies involved in open source

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,799
software projects or open source

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,000
software projects involved

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,760
in in companies or how to get

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,120
companies to be more successful working

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,440
on open source software

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,320
um but if if not i'll just open it to

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,600
questions or chat

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,600
and if not then that i i'll let you go

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
so you think sharon says there's a lack

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,559
of understanding of how open source

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
software projects really work and it's a

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,399
little scary for them

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,279
i agree it's it's it's really scary for

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,440
companies

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,640
um i worked at an open source software

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,960
startup where

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,559
somebody who worked there had come there

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
from enterprise software

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,039
and he would regularly come into my

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,760
office we had offices like real offices

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,279
with doors

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,039
and he would come in and he would say

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,799
stormy i don't get it like

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,559
why are they doing this like why are

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,360
they working on this for free

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,000
um and i had many a beer with him and i

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,919
tried to explain

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,279
many times and i just don't think he

00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,600
really got

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,120
like really i mean he understood but he

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
didn't really understand like why people

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,600
work on it for free

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,520
um and and so i think that

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,679
to a company that's spending most of its

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,720
time thinking about profit and customers

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,399
and sales

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,399
it's sometimes a bit of a shift

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,399
so rich says open source is so much more

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,720
professional now and projects are so

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,240
much more complicated and it can be so

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,760
hard to be at the level of expertise

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,320
necessary to contribute

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,960
um that's very true i think so i i

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,480
talked to

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,600
that's what i was alluding to and i said

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,120
it's really hard to know what the

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
requirements for your project are

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,880
like how people use it but i also agree

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,240
that the level of expertise to

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,919
contribute to a project is

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,080
is much higher now and people are much

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,039
more specialized so it takes an entire

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,399
team

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,080
and they actually think that means a lot

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,399
more projects are

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,480
our groups of companies contributing to

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,440
it as opposed to just groups of

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,520
individuals

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,360
and and so i think being able to harness

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,840
those those corporate contributions is

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,279
key

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,279
and getting those corporations to work

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,200
well together is key

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
and i actually think groups like the

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,240
apache foundation the eclipse foundation

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,000
the linux foundation

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
have done really well at getting

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,760
companies to

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,760
to work together on open source software

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,600
yeah and there are differences in

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,960
projects so dave says that no one an

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,720
open office is paid

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,760
and rich says like on openstack you have

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,480
to have thousands of dollars for

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,880
equipment

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,320
um so it does still vary um by project

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,080
and i think it varies very much by like

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,840
is this a project an individual can use

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,760
like openoffice is a

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,120
a single person project i mean you might

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,120
be collaborating with others but you're

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,120
running open office on your computer

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,720
whereas open stack is something you're

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:47,840
usually using for a solution that's

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,840
bigger than a one person problem

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,679
so be an interesting conversation so

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,360
dave says that um oracle and ibm gave to

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,440
open office and then left

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,960
and it would be a curious conversation

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,120
like are they still using it

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,000
why why did they give why did they still

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
leave

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,200
like that that would have that would be

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,440
interesting to

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,960
do to look at in retrospect and would

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
have been an interesting analysis to do

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,840
at the time

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,840
to see if open office could have kept

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
them

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,559
thanks rich thanks for for joining in

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,399
the middle of your conference organizing

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:30,559
i'm impressed

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,919
so ansem says for for new people most

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,760
projects they end up working with are

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,519
mature projects that are too complex and

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,360
have a higher barrier of entry

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,720
um the people who used to open source

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,480
are the ones who explore newer

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,440
incubating projects which have a lower

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,960
barrier

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,720
um i agree it's much easier

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,279
to to start off as an individual on a

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,039
on a project that's new or that you can

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,200
encompass the whole thing

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,159
and there i think companies um

00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,480
corporations

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,000
contribute a lot by participating in the

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,120
projects that are really complex and it

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,080
takes a

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,440
it i think we used to talk about barrier

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,840
to entry for projects

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
um and for if you want individuals to

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,720
contribute in their free time your

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
project has to be pretty

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,840
simple and pretty easy to get started

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,360
with because um

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,799
if i'm spending my evenings and my

00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,799
weekends on this probably not going to

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,279
join a project that takes me a week or

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,240
two

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,279
to to get involved in to get started in

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,159
like i want to contribute

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,760
right away whereas a company can afford

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,640
that they can pay somebody's salary for

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,240
a couple weeks

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,840
while they get ramped up and they get

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,360
started on the project

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,880
so it's a different barrier of entry to

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,120
some projects and that's both good and

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
bad

00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,360
so shane says he's on the board for asf

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,799
and he's wondering how we can get stormy

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,760
to write the community version of an

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,240
inner source guide

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,320
thanks shane um one from the outside of

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,600
companies that explains foss communities

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,200
all the ways that corporate teams

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,880
organize themselves about dealing with

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,720
the community

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,919
and about how to ask for money i'll try

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,360
to blog on some of those i've been

00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,279
looking for more blogging topics so if

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,600
anybody has any to give me that would be

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,600
useful
