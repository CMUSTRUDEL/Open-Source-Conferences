	Lightweight Open Source
Issac Goldstand

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Ever think about contributing to the Open Source world, but worried that - for some reason or another - it’s not up to par with playing with the “big boys and girls”? That’s BS! Come learn why *every* contribution in the Open Source world can be helpful! As an active participant in the Open Source community for over twenty years, I am constantly running into situations where prospective newcomers to the community feel daunted and undervaluating themselves and/or their contributions. In this session I’ll talk about the importance of that exact sort of small contribution in some of the biggest Open Source communities and projects out there. Because sometimes a sub-domain expert is *much* more vital than yet another domain expert.

Issac has been involved in the Web community for nearly 20 years. With a strong background in the Apache Web Server internals, and optimizing web applications, Issac continues to churn out highly optimized web applications in a variety of languages and servers, as well as mentoring teams of programmers to be as passionate about writing great software as he is. Today Issac is married with four kids, and is launching a start-up to chase his long time dream: turning smart homes into a day-to-day "taken for granted" reality. In his spare time, he still spends time volunteering in the tech community and mentoring hi-tech teams across a diverse range of languages and disciplines.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
yes

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,800
all right thank you so uh

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,000
sorry folks about that delay uh it was

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,040
not planned but uh

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,760
i'm happy that we made it through

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,840
uh so for the next uh 35 or so minutes i

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,879
want to talk a little bit about

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,160
lightweight open source

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,879
and so first of all why why are you

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,120
interested in

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,559
lightweight open source so if you're

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,920
listening to this if you're out there in

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,960
the audience or listening to the

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
playback on youtube

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,120
you probably have some interest in

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,000
giving back to the open source community

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
otherwise you would be

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
you know here at apachecon with us

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
so hopefully that's already you and

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,720
the truth is that we already use open

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,680
source so increasingly

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,320
in our daily lives we have our cellular

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,080
devices

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,560
are based on open source uh our browsers

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
are based on open source major

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
components

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
of most operating systems are built on

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
open source

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
operating systems themselves are based

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,759
on open source

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
and so are many of the biggest

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,159
technologies that power the internet as

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,159
we know it

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
so why what's in it for me well the

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,360
truth is

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
altruism is the name of the game you

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
know we

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,439
uh one of the earlier presentations were

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
talking about you know

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,360
what would you get out of it we had all

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,560
sorts of benefits like

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,759
learning and the community and uh

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,040
a gaining experience and that's true you

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
can get experience

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
it looks great on your resume afterwards

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
um

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,159
in today's day and age uh hr personnel

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,680
recruiters are increasingly looking

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,680
at your social profile when you're

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,720
applying for a job so the fact that

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
you're doing

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,800
uh an open source contribution is gonna

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,840
be a big thing

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,400
and it will get noticed

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,360
so who is this for before i get into who

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,120
this is for

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,640
i want to take a second to talk about

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
the pareto principle

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,360
now in 1896 a guy named joseph m juran

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
suggested

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
uh the pareto principle he he named it

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
after

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,840
the italian economist wilfredo polito

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,879
and the pareto principle talks about

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,440
the vital few and the useful memory

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,080
okay and it says that basically for many

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
events

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,760
roughly 80 of the effects come from only

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,800
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
of the causes so how does that have to

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,360
do

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
with open source at all certainly

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
lightweight open source

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,080
so in open source we have our

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,840
heavyweights right

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,920
we have people like minus torvalds

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
uh who developed linux we have uh from

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,080
the docker family as your own pedestrian

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,760
uh here from the asf we have guys like

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
uh jim jagilski

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,760
uh kelsey hightower and the work he's

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,519
been doing with google and kubernetes

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
right these guys are heavyweights they

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,560
contribute uh massive amounts of their

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,360
time

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,680
of their working day and working hours

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
uh

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
and even their non-working hours and

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,760
efforts

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,200
and then we have the other 20 right the

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
lightweights

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,879
right in in correspondence with those

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,599
heavy lifters

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,799
now the lightweights are actually 80 of

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,159
the community

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,200
uh and they're getting only 20 of

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,640
the amount of work uh done but these

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,000
guys are critical

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
because when we talk about the

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,440
heavyweights we're talking about domain

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,799
experts

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,799
but there's something that domain

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,720
experts are really missing out

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,720
is the sub domain expertise

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,799
so what am i talking about when i talk

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
about subdomains with you let me give

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,519
you an example

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,319
i don't know if he's here in the

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
audience now but uh does anyone know who

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,239
this is

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
this is lewis mcgibby where's my

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,479
giveaway

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,639
uh is a member of the asf and

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,359
i first met him actually in i think it

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
was 2011

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,560
uh he and i met at heathrow airport we

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
were both on our way to

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,240
uh apache from north america which was

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,240
in vancouver back then you know that it

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,199
wasn't covered we actually got to go

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,199
and meet each other uh and we just got

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,240
the chat and we met at the airport

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,600
flight uh you know the way over um

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
and i asked him about himself and he

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,720
really fascinated me

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
his background isn't even in software

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,000
engineering his background is in civil

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,320
engineering and later with a phd in

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,199
engineering informatics

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,360
he worked with construction and in his

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,000
work with construction projects

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
he realized that a big part of any work

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
in any

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
construction project is the

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
communication between a big variety of

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,680
stakeholders

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
and part of the problems that arise when

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
these projects would get really

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
compressed and they're

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,520
the huge amounts of people is the

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,360
ability to find the correct information

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,880
at a particular time

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
and that got him to look into

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,479
information of detrimental

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,919
uh and information eventually an act of

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,919
developing software

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,080
to address uh issues around that and

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,720
that got into apache he discovered the

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,240
apache wasting project uh and searching

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
he started looking at source code and

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,720
writing problems and building software

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,600
capable of helping him uh solve some of

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,440
the obstacles

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,919
that he was experiencing within his phd

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,160
work and when he started you know he

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
dealt a bit with lucien he dealt with

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
much

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,960
a few years later when i checked back

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
into him

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
uh he was involved in all sorts of

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,479
projects here

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919
just in the asf with tikka with the

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,520
incubator with

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,880
any 23 with a climate workbench okay

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,880
now why am i saying this

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,319
because a lot of people who come into

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,120
open source they feel

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,600
that they there's a certain bar that's

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,360
going to be

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,039
expected of them on the software

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,600
engineering level

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,280
and that's just not true you know this

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
is an example of a very successful

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,160
person in the open source community

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
uh who started with zero knowledge with

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,440
software engineering

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,600
so it's just not there and these

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,720
contributions are actually encoded in a

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
bit we're going to talk about other

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,520
kinds of contributions

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,039
that are not only code so

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,360
really if you've been hesitant if you've

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,880
been saying well i'm not good enough or

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
i don't have the background that i need

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,520
or i know

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,919
it's excuses if you want to get involved

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,639
then the community is looking for you

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,639
and we're welcoming

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,720
okay so that deals with the why now we

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
want to talk

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,479
how can you help how can you get

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,880
involved well

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,080
there are a number of ways that you can

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,199
get involved

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,880
um first and foremost is

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,680
uh bugs right and if you they will come

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,039
every software project uh open source

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,440
and commercial alike

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,800
uh is usually written with uh nasty

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,840
software bugs

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,880
uh and the community this sub domain

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,240
expertise

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,280
that you can get out of submitting bugs

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
is enormously valuable because people

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,199
who are developing the software

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,400
are developing software from a very

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
particular mindset they're

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,639
in a box even if they're building unit

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,560
tests and integration bases

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,680
and all sorts of you know great testing

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,840
framework which is

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
a really important thing it's very

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
different than

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,520
running in end user environments and

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
understanding the kind of bugs that can

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,280
come up with

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,879
all sorts of edge use cases um

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,639
that these people aren't even

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
considering um

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,319
and the truth is it's really easy to get

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,840
involved to do that kind of thing today

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,639
uh github being what it is

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,680
there's an enormous amount of focus

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,280
thank you microsoft

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,599
uh for um for your contribution and

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,400
for taking ownership and and continuing

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,639
the stewardship

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
of you know who thought that i would

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,000
have said that

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,000
15 years ago um it's an amazing platform

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
and it makes it really really lowers the

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
bar uh

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,159
to get the bug and there are going to be

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
different software projects out of them

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
some will have templates

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,959
which they want you to fill out some

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,479
will even really be insistent that you

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,080
fill it out their way

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,560
because they might need that kind of

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,560
information but nothing gets

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,680
nothing actually doesn't get looked at

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,279
or almost nothing

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,120
in most projects right uh if you can

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
give the details you don't know how much

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,200
details are going to need

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
usually if there's a template for an

00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,519
issue report

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,800
then the developers are going to kind of

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,360
guide you to this is the kind of

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,480
information or this is the type of ones

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
that we're going to need but it might

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,360
not always be there if it's not there be

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,880
as detailed as you can

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
another really important takeaway when

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,959
you deal with bug reports

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,839
is to follow up to confirm the fixes you

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,320
know sometimes

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
uh sometimes you'll report about you

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,600
know

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,839
this whole feature just not working when

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,320
you're when you're doing it in aws

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,519
it works in the google cloud but when

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,120
you run in aws

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,360
doesn't work and they say well try it

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
and it might fix it for you so if so

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,320
follow up confirm that the fix

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,440
actually worked but

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,440
again even if you don't

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,640
now one of the things that i really love

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,839
uh about this apache cod in contrast to

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,200
every previous apache con that we've had

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,399
is the an insane international um

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,040
presence at this so people

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,360
who english isn't your native tongue a

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
great place to help out is localization

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
and it's not always you know english

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,600
isn't your uh your your um

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,600
prime your primary language uh you're at

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,440
the apache software foundation

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,120
english has become a first-class citizen

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
but that's not true with all the

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,519
projects out there

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
if you know the language that a project

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,320
has been developed

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,399
or documented or displayed in the user

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
interface is displayed in

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,440
and you know another language then your

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,720
help

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,800
would be phenomenal help translate

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,120
the project the documentation whatever

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,560
it is uh to your language

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,240
because that's a place where you have

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,399
sub-domain expertise

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
that the the creators of that open

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,839
source software

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
uh may not have

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,839
yeah yeah this is good okay i'm really

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
really sorry

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,320
so localization uh help translate the

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
project into your language

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,040
answering questions is a huge thing so

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
here at apache uh we have the idea of

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,560
user's mailing list

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,480
every single top level project will uh i

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,880
think every single top level project

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
will have a user's mailing list these

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,720
aren't even necessarily developer

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,600
or development related questions these

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,240
are end user questions

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,480
um but it doesn't have to be on the

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,839
mailing list and we have users list

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,839
people still use irc or discord or slack

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,320
or whatever

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,360
github a lot of times people open bug

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,200
reports

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
uh on things that are not necessarily

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
even bug reports and you know that's

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
okay

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,519
that happens uh but the developers who

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
are monitoring

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
the issue trackers may not be able to

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
answer it but here you could bring in

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,800
subdomain

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,240
expertise um and of course you know

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
stack overflow

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
uh the the uh one of the most popular

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
repositories of just

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
you know general technical knowledge out

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
there today

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
um it's you know don't don't be

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
satisfied with just

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,839
reading answers or copying and pasting

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,399
the code from there get involved

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,519
help out i guarantee you every single

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,760
one of you out there

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
that you know something about your

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,240
favorite project

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,959
that a lot of other users don't know

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,360
and that knowledge can really really be

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,360
critical

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,959
churches patches are welcome

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,639
i actually i have a story that i want to

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,760
tell uh about this slide a few years ago

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
uh i was working uh a different company

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,800
a company called

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,519
iron source uh and one of

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
we were playing around with rancher and

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,800
kubernetes this would have been about

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,440
four years ago kubernetes wasn't quite

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,959
where it was today

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,720
and uh one of our devops engineers found

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,120
you know some sort of uh little issue

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
and he couldn't figure out why it wasn't

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,160
working he ended up delving into the

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,839
source code

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:18,000
and finding you know why kubernetes

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,120
wasn't working quite the way that he

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,440
needed kubernetes to work and fix that

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
and uh his name was nina i went over to

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
him and he's telling me yeah and i got a

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,000
problem

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,040
fixed and i said dude you know

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,480
go to github open a poll request

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,560
um and and the feedback that i got

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,519
was um you know no i don't think so

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,000
uh it might it might not you know who

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,240
else

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
actually cares about this really long

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,399
shot use case

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
which is the use case that he was

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,760
dealing with

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,519
um and and i pushed him and

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
he went and eventually after a bit of

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,880
prodding he went and he opened the uh

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,800
he opened the torah first and guess what

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,079
happened

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,279
nothing what are your silence and

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,720
um silence a week two weeks a month two

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,320
months went by

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,720
and he comes back to me he's like yeah

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,360
you know isaac

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,320
he gave me advice she said you know with

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,760
the patch but

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,880
i told you it's not important enough to

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,480
them

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
they don't care about this particular

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,959
use case you know i'm kind of sorry i

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,079
even i even bothered him

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,079
now i'm really embarrassed

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,560
two days later he uh we get to reply in

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,079
github

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,480
you know sorry you know we really

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,199
appreciate the the

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
patch the truth is that you uh you

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,320
actually

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,680
contributed the patch just a few days

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
after we went into a

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,120
feature in bug freeze because of a big

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,920
upcoming release

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,360
uh but we got it out of the way and uh

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,639
we're merging it in

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,079
to trump and and it's him today

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,760
um and he

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,079
needs us to say you know he came back to

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,360
me he was gaming like isaac isaac

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,440
look they took it they took the patch

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,880
and and that came with its own thing you

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,480
know a part of

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,399
just the the the feeling good uh of it

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,760
and a part of the award for getting you

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,920
know the contributor

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,279
icon or title or whatever it is that

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,160
that outputs

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,040
uh once your code you know attached with

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,759
your

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,560
git handle is merged into a patch so

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,560
aside from that

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,160
it means that a domain expert you know

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
one of the

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,880
the people who do kubernetes for either

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,480
either for a living or as their

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,480
full-time side project

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,079
actually went in vetted your case

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,120
decided that there was

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,000
demonstrated sub-domain expertise

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,440
and went in and did it um and you know

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,560
that's not alone example

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
uh i had another colleague of mine

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,000
run into a similar uh kind of an edge

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,839
case thing

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
uh with a rabbit enqueue software also

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,079
around the same amount of time

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,079
she was accepted

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,280
[Music]

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,800
was just released about a month ago and

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,160
when it was opened in open beta i

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,920
you know gave him this report very

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,600
detailed saying you know i tried doing

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
this and it didn't quite work and

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,519
there's a lot of back and forth with uh

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,680
one of the entry-level people there

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,600
who's trying to debug it and i want to

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
hear them now actually just this morning

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,920
i woke up

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,920
with one of the engineers saying hey i'm

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,639
sorry it took so long isaac

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,320
i created a test case here at this my

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,399
own personal repository

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
but i can't quite recreate it can you

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,160
give it a try

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,519
um and uh you know

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,600
there's no really happy ending to the

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,560
story about me because in the end what

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,480
happened was i went

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,400
i couldn't uh recreate it and then i

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,640
took an hour of my day and i went back

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
you know in time uh to get to the

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,679
original issue that i

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,760
that it was that i thought it triggered

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
it or something you know approximating

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,120
the original issue because obviously if

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,439
there was a bug in mind actually

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,720
uh commit that to source code and i

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,520
actually got back him i said you know

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,760
what

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,679
i can't recreate it with my original

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,959
code with the original versions of the

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,120
software so

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,720
it's not always there either but that

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,280
was also really appreciated because

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,600
suddenly

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,200
you know there was this engineer came

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,799
out with a bit of uh

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,600
uh closure to his side of things because

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,760
remember

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
um you know kind of on the same vein of

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,160
what prasant was uh

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,640
uh presenting in the previous uh uh in

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,039
the previous presentation here

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,000
we're all human we're all human beings

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,400
you know and an

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,720
open source especially uh where

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,559
community is such a central thing

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
we're all open you know we're all human

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,480
beings and just

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,360
taking the time to write hey you know i

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,720
gave it a shot i couldn't reproduce it

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
that goes a long way also

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
uh the next thing i want to talk about

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,360
is micro projects

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,240
does anyone know is there anyone from

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,240
the node.js

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,160
community in the audience that that

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,120
recognizes this

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
i don't think so i guess a lot of people

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,200
uh

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,080
got scared off by the fact that we

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
didn't have a presentation

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,880
this is the source code of a

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,679
very famous library on npm uh

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,679
called left code

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,240
this is the entire source code of it now

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,039
there's a very interesting

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
story behind it you might think you know

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,440
this is silly

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,280
and what does this do for anyone who

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
reads javascript you can see that all

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,039
this does

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,080
this entire module which is insanely

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,200
popular

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,919
all it does is it takes a string

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,679
and it removes any leading white space

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,000
from the left side of that string and it

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,320
gives it back

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,320
simple right so what happened

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:14,320
uh this was written by a guy named

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,080
and about five or six years ago now four

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,559
or five years ago

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,240
uh he had he had a whole bunch of things

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,840
that were all published to npm

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,799
npm is the is the module registry for

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
node.js

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,960
okay that's where you know uh it's the

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,559
equivalent of cpan if you're in pearl or

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,720
a pipeline if you're on python

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,720
or nuget if you're on um

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,520
c or c plus and etc you get the idea

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,200
so this guy aids or actually had a lot

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,120
of libraries published and this was like

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,840
a really really small one

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,640
and without going into too many details

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,880
there

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,799
was a conflict with the name of another

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,160
package that he'd uh written

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,840
you know he had another package i don't

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,480
remember it offhand i'm sorry

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
uh called foo and there was this company

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,799
that said that said hey

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,960
you know uh we actually

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,039
develop a commercial product quote we'd

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,080
like to use that name space

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,240
would you mind giving it to us and he

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
basically answered the back saying yeah

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
um no

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,840
because there are a lot of people using

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,960
this this name space that of the package

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,480
that i developed and i don't want to

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,240
ruin their lives

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,960
um so being a classic example

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
of an anti-pattern in open source this

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,480
company

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
said okay well they went to npm the

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,880
company

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
who managed the corporate entity that

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,640
managed the

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,799
project registry and they said slap

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
trademark infringement this project is

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
using our name

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,520
we we have a trademark registered to the

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,440
name we want them

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,039
now open source is tends to be back to a

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
corporate that brings a lot of money

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,000
into it either a corporate entity

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,200
sponsoring a project or a whole bunch of

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
corporate entities just

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,960
sponsoring general funds uh kind of like

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,960
the way things work here at the asf

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,960
so when a big company comes with a

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,039
litigation suit there's

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,799
not always a lot of options there that

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,919
could be taken depends on the strength

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,720
of the

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,039
of a company so an npm registry

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,240
basically caved

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,640
and they said sorry we uh we got a legal

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,600
complaint we're legally obliged

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,919
and they went and they uh they they they

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,720
moved the ownership of that name space

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,480
from azerto to this company and azer

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,520
wrote an open letter he discovered it a

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
few hours later

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,000
he wrote a really angry open letter uh

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,559
and he went and unpublished

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,280
his everything that he had on npm and he

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,360
said you know

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,120
forget it i don't want any three you

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,360
know if you're going to play the game

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,360
and i don't want anything to do with you

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,200
uh let me unpublish this little left pad

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,440
this little left bed module can you

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,440
think

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,600
interesting story you know classic uh

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,720
evil corp kind of uh

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,640
kind of tongues so what

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,320
so so what happened over the next few

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,360
hours over the next few hours

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,200
builds on a huge

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,200
huge amount i'm looking like 70 80

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
percent of commercial projects

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,799
uh built with node.js out there started

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,159
dying

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,440
and no one could figure out what was

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,440
going on it took several hours

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:29,039
uh of of digging but it turned out

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,320
that a very famous transpiler for

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,039
node.js uh called babel uh

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,960
actually had this left pad as dependency

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,039
now not everyone was using left pad

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,720
immediately you know as a first as a

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,080
direct dependency

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,000
but you had babel was a huge hugely

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,880
hugely popular framework because it

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,039
allowed

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
it allowed you basically to use new

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,320
javascript features that were not yet

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,640
released into the language

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,520
by kind of forward backwards compiling

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,440
it uh

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,039
into the existing javascript uh

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
framework so you could use all these new

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,679
cool features and keywords and whatnot

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,520
and babel had a dependency on left pad

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
and when left pad disappeared

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,200
babel disappeared and when babel

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,720
disappeared build scripts for

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,360
enormous amounts of code that we're

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,600
using uh babel

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,000
just stopped working and the end

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,280
someone someone managed to find an old

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,880
copy

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,799
leftpad had been very permissively

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,280
licensed so someone just you know back

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,919
found their original code uh put up a

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,720
new

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,480
uh project on npm i believe they even

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,240
got the name space back they when they

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,640
complained to npm npm

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
guys i i we appreciate what you're

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,240
trying to do to this corporation but you

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
just broke the cause the internet to get

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,039
broken

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,480
um npm got a little bit ruffled in this

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,960
case azer actually

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,799
uh willingly gave up uh his claims on

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,400
the on the left pad namespace because he

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,120
still wanted nothing to do with npm

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,360
anymore

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,440
uh and so that the the person who

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,520
overtook the project had this actually

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
uh available and was able to to

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,279
republish left pad

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,880
uh with the original source code under

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,000
you know a similarly permissive

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,520
uh library and life went back to normal

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,960
it was the buzz of the internet uh

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,039
anyone in the no jazz community knew

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,720
about this for all three or four days

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,480
so nice story what's the point

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,159
point is don't be afraid of micro

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,640
projects okay

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,400
this is a really really simple uh

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,200
project as you can see this is the

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,039
entirety of an open source project an

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,039
open source project that the author

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:35,520
any casual viewer and think hey

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,360
you know this this isn't critical man

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840
there are a million ways that this could

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,039
be done

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,799
who who cares about this um and this is

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,520
the perfect example to show you

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,760
how much impact that could have you know

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,279
the subdomain expertise that someone had

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,640
not because they were the only ones that

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,000
knew how to write it because they were

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,919
the first ones

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,200
that bothered to write it and bothered

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,240
to publish it and share it with the

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,360
community

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,279
um and and it became and it still

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,960
is uh such a major player uh in a hugely

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,559
popular ecosystem

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,520
uh over the course of years and years um

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,520
so don't be afraid

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,720
so caveats um don't over commit

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,480
don't burn out slow and steady wins the

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,480
race you know when's it it's it's not a

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,880
race it's a marathon

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,760
um don't come with expectations you know

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,159
if you come

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,360
to the game thinking i'm going to write

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,640
the next left pad

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,919
you know or i'm going to write the next

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
kubernetes or i'm going to write the

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,600
next

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,400
whatever or you know i'm going to

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,520
i spent 50 hours trying to reverse

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,760
engineer this this

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,600
really tight edge case which was

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,880
incredibly complicated but i did it i

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,000
got the solution

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,320
and i want to share it with everyone

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
and it may not get looked at right like

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,039
my friend dima earlier

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,240
he had two months knowing known radio

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,279
silence

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,039
um he had a happy ending not everyone

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,360
has the happy ending sometimes you know

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,159
the

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,279
the bug will just sit sometimes it'll

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,240
get overlooked

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,120
sometimes the community just won't click

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,039
with it

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,559
um so yeah don't come with expectations

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,880
um have a passion for what you do okay

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,080
uh i wrote an interesting post on this

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,279
um

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,559
uh prompted by steven wally who's a big

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,279
open source

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,200
uh advocate and he works he's actually

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,200
been working 20 years in microsoft so

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,080
even the old microsoft

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,520
you know he was a big open source person

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,480
he helped write the original

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,840
unix subsystem which has been uh

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,000
replaced by the modern

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,039
wsl subsystem which has become amazingly

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,200
popular

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,279
in windows 10 and um

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,440
he and i had a discussion at one point

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,120
around the time when i gave this talk uh

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,880
when i last gave this stuff

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,480
uh at the at an osi party a year and a

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,919
half ago

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,679
and we were talking about why people

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,720
would want to give it i was very um

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,159
my personal opinionated view is that i

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,520
think a lot of people here in open

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
source

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,640
who are successful at doing it

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,559
continually

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,080
over years and years and years and still

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,440
not burning out it's people who are

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,360
giving for the sake of giving it's

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,919
giving because

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,279
it's because it's spreading love because

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,399
love you know we were talking about

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,120
emotions in the last

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,720
uh lecture is an incredibly powerful and

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,120
important human emotion

00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,640
uh and this sometimes sometimes is the

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,760
way that we or one of the ways that we

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,600
can express it

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,799
uh and share you know with with the

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,159
entire world

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,799
um if you don't really connect to what i

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,880
just said

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,320
uh if you don't really have the passion

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,840
if you're not able to

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,880
do for the sake of giving or if you

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,679
don't feel you know warm and gooey and

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,559
uh empowered uh by by the fact that

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,320
you're giving

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,799
then you're in the danger of above

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,360
pitfalls that doesn't mean don't give

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,399
give anyways everything is appreciated

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,640
like i've

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,440
uh been saying for the last half an hour

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,720
or so

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,520
but be careful don't over commit slow

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,760
and steady

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,600
it's a marathon not a race and don't

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,960
come with your expectations

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,880
and uh most importantly have fun

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,880
because that's really what it's about um

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,559
finished a bit a little bit early i'll

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,720
try to go fast because we have the

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,799
little gremlins back

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,840
if there are any questions i'd be happy

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,840
to take them

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
so do i think that sometimes when people

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,640
start contributing to open source

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,960
they want to show that they are good and

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,960
so wants to do a lot of things fast

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,080
it depends on the person but absolutely

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
like i said

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,120
one of the big motives for open source

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,480
you know is

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,559
uh is is not only getting the experience

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,520
but gaining the visibility you know in

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,520
social channels

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,960
because it could help you people might

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,760
see your posts

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,039
as people might see stars on uh github

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,880
and that might help you

00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,799
get your next job or get involved in

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,039
something else that you care about

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,799
um so you you they might be doing lots

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,840
of things fast now the question that you

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,640
didn't ask

00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,640
which i'd like to follow up on is is

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,320
that a problem

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,919
and it really depends on the person so

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,000
if you're doing it you know from a place

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
of altruism if you're enjoying what

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,399
you're doing even though you're going

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,240
fast

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,399
then it doesn't matter then you know

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,880
keep the pace up keep going fast

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,080
uh if you feel that that you're starting

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,039
to burn out if you're starting to feel

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,399
like this isn't so much fun anymore

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,320
then definitely put the brakes on a

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,919
little bit you know tone it back maybe

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,120
you can take a break take a break for

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,200
a week take a break from home take a

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,200
break for a year uh

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,000
i'll come back because the community

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,640
needs you an open source

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,640
anything else

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,679
at the beginning of the talk you saw a

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,640
slide about opening time at work bench

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,000
uh i think you're referring to uh this

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,399
slide right

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,039
this slide uh if so actually isn't so

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,440
much about

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,360
uh apache open climate workbench which i

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,000
unfortunately don't know so much about

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:38,960
uh as much as about uh my friend lewis

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,960
of you know explaining how even without

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,000
thinking that you have the background

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,240
uh you not only contribute but you

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,840
could become a major contributor if

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,880
you'd only give yourself a chance to do

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,799
so

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,880
so i'm sorry i can't really talk more

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,360
about open climate workbench

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,240
uh but with these three days of tracks

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,440
here at apachecon

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,760
hopefully you'll be able to find a

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,279
session um that will give you more of

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,960
the information

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:19,840
thank you and i'm sorry

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:19,840

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,440
note thank you so much uh for bearing

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,559

uh and i hope this talk left you

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,519
a little bit more inspired to come be

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,679
apart be a part of open source be a part

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,120
of the apache software foundation

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,480
be part of whatever you desire to be

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,000

will be making an

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,120
impact in a better world whether you

00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:01,840
know it or not thank you so so much
