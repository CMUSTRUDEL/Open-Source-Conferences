	Growing with the Open-Source Community

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

During this talk, I want to share lessons I've learned as a young engineer contributing to an open-source project. Those include demystifying the stereotype of OSS contributors, "community over code" approach as well as understanding the life cycle and funding of projects. But the most important lesson is why young people should join open source communities early in their careers. They can gain tremendous experience which is quite often out of their reach when working on commercial projects. Also encouraging young people to join OSS project allow us as communities to validate our contribution guides and check if we create a really welcoming environment.
