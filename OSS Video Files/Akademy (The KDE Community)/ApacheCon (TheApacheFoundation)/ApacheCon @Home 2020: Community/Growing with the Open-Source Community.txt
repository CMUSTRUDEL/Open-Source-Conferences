Description: 
	Growing with the Open-Source Community
Tomasz Urbaszek

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

During this talk, I want to share lessons I've learned as a young engineer contributing to an open-source project. Those include demystifying the stereotype of OSS contributors, "community over code" approach as well as understanding the life cycle and funding of projects. But the most important lesson is why young people should join open source communities early in their careers. They can gain tremendous experience which is quite often out of their reach when working on commercial projects. Also encouraging young people to join OSS project allow us as communities to validate our contribution guides and check if we create a really welcoming environment.

[Music]

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
okay

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,559
so i think it's time to start uh

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
i hope that everyone is able to see me

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,200
and hear me

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,000
uh so today i would like to tell you

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
more about

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,079
growing with the open source community

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,480
especially about

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
last year when i joined the open source

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,960
for the first time

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,320
and the lessons i've learned during this

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,840
year

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,079
but first of all i'm thomas urbach i'm

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
a software engineer at polidia which is

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,320
a

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,359
software house in the poland in warsaw

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
i'm also pmc member of the apache

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,799
airflow project

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,360
i'm also chapter lead of the apache

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,560
local community

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119
chapter in warsaw and i'm also quite a

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,200
big

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
fan of few others open source projects

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,320
where i try to contribute and help

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,560
people

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,400
make the projects better you can find me

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,680
on github and twitter using the

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:30,400
telugu github handle and

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,840
yeah that's that's about me and

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,079
what is this talk all about so

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
during this 30 minutes i would like to

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,400
tell you the story of

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,920
one year of doing open source and i want

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
to

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,720
put this here into 10 lessons and that i

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
think that are worth knowing

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,640
about the open source and this is for

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,960
people who are

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
from outside the open source but i think

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,840
that

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
if you are somehow related to the open

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,399
source uh

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,200
you will find this also useful or

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,320
informative from the perspective of a

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,360
quite newcomer

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,640
like me but

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,040
let's take a look at the last year uh

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,120
quite a few months more than one year so

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,840
i'm a software engineer for three years

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,520
now uh but last year i decided to change

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,640
a company and

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,920
in june 2018 i joined paulidea

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,040
and there i joined the apache airfo team

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,519
so last year i started to contribute to

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
the

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,640
uh open source on daily basis and i was

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,319
paid for that

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,640
and at that time our team in polydia

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,519
counted five people including two

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,080
committers apache airflow committers

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,040
and then i started to contribute more

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,879
and more

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,920
in my free time and i was so uh

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,120
surprised by the open source that uh in

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,120
october last year i go to the apache con

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
in berlin together with my friend jarek

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,680
from polidia

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,400
we went there and uh i was

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
surprised by what i told her because

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,159
there was a lot of people who were doing

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,480
the open source longer than i live

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,280
and this was really a opening and when

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,400
we were

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,440
going back to poland from berlin i

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,159
decided that

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,920
it would be awesome to have apache

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,959
meetup in warsaw

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,360
so in february 2020 we

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
established the apache local community

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,760
chapter in warsaw

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,120
where i become the chapter elite but in

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,280
the meantime i was

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
also invited to become the apache

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,879
airflow committer and i was

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,560
really happy about this this invitation

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,879
and currently in june july

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,440
i was also invited to become a patch

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,239
airflow pmc member

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,680
and as to as of today our team in

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,439
polydia

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,680
counts eight people including free pmcs

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,799
but we also have other teams that are

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,439
contributing to

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,640
apache beam project apache superset or

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,879
many other

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,680
open source projects in the apache

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,319
software foundation

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,280
and today i would like to share what

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,479
i've learned

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,040
during this last year and

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,079
here are the here are the 10 lessons

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,080
learned after

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,240
year of contributing to open source

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,360
and the first lesson is uh quite

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
surprising for

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
probably for many uh the first lesson is

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,280
that you can be young

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,479
to join open source and i'm

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,960
as of monday i'm 26 years old so i'm

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
quite

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,000
young taking uh into accounts

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,280
how did uh did how people from apache

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,800
social foundation

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
look like because participants under 24

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
years

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
are represent less than five percent and

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
this is according to the

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
this year apache uh coming apache solar

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,160
foundation community survey

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,199
and that was really uh

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,560
surprising because i always thought that

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,560
to be able to do open source you have

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,240
more years than 20 queue and

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,000
before joining the palladia in the open

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
source i just i just thought that i'm

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,600
too young to do open source

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
and i was surprised that there is no age

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
limit

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,240
uh that there's no age limit you can

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,759
have any age

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
but i i'm i was not that much mistaken

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
from

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:42,080
uh from the fact that the the age

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,800
has some uh value like volume maybe not

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
it's not the best word but it was true

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
that

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
people are quite older in the apache

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,080
soldier foundation because the average

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,919
age of

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:58,080
the asf contributor is about 40 years

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,880
but that's one thing that you don't have

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,919
to be

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,720
old you can be on but the second thing

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
is you don't need experience you don't

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
need experience you don't

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
need phd any degree or any formal

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,440
education

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,960
there is no formal requirements for you

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,039
to join open source

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,400
because the open source is for anyone

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,039
anyone can join

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,039
open source because open source welcomes

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,759
everyone

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,840
and this is amazing because as i said

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,199
previously i thought that i'm too young

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,520
to join the open source but behind this

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
idea of being too young i think there is

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
a

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,919
also idea of having

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,720
not that much experience that i was

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,199
too less experienced to join open source

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
but

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,240
i also learned that it's not only that

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,639
the open source

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
is for anyone it's an amazing place for

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,639
young people

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,800
for people who are still studying or are

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,360
at the beginning of their career

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,840
because in the open source you can learn

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,919
a lot

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,360
and to support what i'm saying

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,599
uh there is a quote from the

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
the same survey of the apache society

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,720
communist foundation

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,360
that tells that one from ten

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,759
person has less than year of experience

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,599
i and i think this is amazing because

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,919
it means that there are people who are

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,199
trying to join open source without

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
that much of experience but what is more

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,919
you don't

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,199
you can be young you don't need a lot of

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,599
experience

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,639
and what is really surprising is that

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,759
you don't

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,880
need to know how to code because the

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
open source is

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,880
something much more than code of course

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
we need code

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,479
that's that that's that's not surprising

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,759
because we are creating

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,120
software but we also need dogs

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
so we need people who are able to ride

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
dogs good

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,199
dogs because good dogs make the projects

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,879
easy to use

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,120
and really really easy to

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,240
to share with the others but we also

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,599
need logos

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,479
every project needs a needle logo and i

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,720
bet not every software engineer is a

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,039
designer so we need designers

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,000
but we need them also to improve our

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,960
user interfaces and user experience

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,680
and this is not only about the web

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,080
application that we use in our software

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
but it's also about documentation pages

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,280
or

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
project web pages so it's really

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,360
important that

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,599
we need those people but we need to also

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,760
design us to create mascots and for

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,320
example apache beam

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,959
have a new mask of science this year but

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,839
there is also the plc forex toddy which

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,240
is

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,839
uh which is quite famous in the apaches

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,720
of the foundation because

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,560
uh he's real because christopher dods

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,240
always carried the mascot on the

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
apache and i think that's this diversity

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
of

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
needs and the diversity of skills that

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,760
is required in the

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,760
open source and the low entry barrier

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,880
that you don't need experience that you

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,720
don't have to be

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,360
a specific age is amazing opportunity

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,279
for

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,440
everyone who wants to join open source

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,120
because open source is a great place to

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,680
learn

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,959
in the open source first of all you can

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,519
get a lot of feedback in fact you may

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
get

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,519
more feedback in open source than in

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,839
many companies because

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,360
the culture of feedback is not common in

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,440
every place

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,440
in case of open source i think it's it's

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,760
quite common it's not always present

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,279
that

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,160
it's rather common and

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,320
what is more in open source there are

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,640
people who are much more experienced

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
have more experience than the seniors

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,279
that the most senior person in your

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
company

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,800
so you can learn from the top engineers

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
in the world

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,480
and i think this is amazing opportunity

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,360
or

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,399
experience for young people that are

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
able to work

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,200
equally with those people because no one

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,320
is going to judge you

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,040
the second thing about open source and

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,600
being a great place to learn is that

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,200
open source provides safety open source

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,279
is a safe place to make

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
mistakes because no one will blame you

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,880
for your mistakes

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,079
we are all accepting that you are still

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,279
learning because

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,920
we are all learning and we know

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,800
that learning and making mistakes but

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
trying

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
to improve ourselves is really important

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,200
because in this

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,839
way the community behind the project is

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,839
becoming stronger and better

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,480
and finally we have the diversity of the

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,200
open source

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
in open source world no one is going to

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
judge

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,000
you or your knowledge all that counts is

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,640
your contribution

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,079
and your will to grow the community to

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,519
help people and to contribute

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,200
and this brings us to

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,320
i think the really uh inspiring quote of

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
root holloway uh which is that open

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,000
source is

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,800
all about building communities around

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
people

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,959
who are passionate about sol problem

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,399
solving problems

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,519
and i think this shows that this is the

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,040
essence of

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,600
the open source because if you

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,000
love to solve problems if you love to

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,560
make the world a better place

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,760
you will be happy in the open search in

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,480
the open source

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,600
you will find like-minded people who

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,560
also love

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
solving problems making people more

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,000
happy

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,000
or just improving everyone's lives

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
and talking about the people and the the

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,320
communities

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,839
the next lesson is the apache software

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
foundation motto which is community

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,839
overcoat

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:04,160
and i must admit that when i joined the

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,440
uh polidia and the open source

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,200
i didn't get it fully like i i fully

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
understand that there is sometimes more

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,839
discussion

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,200
than coding and writing code

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,519
and it was okay like yeah i know that we

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
have to make this this caching because

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,079
there is more people

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,079
around this uh this part of codes or or

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,079
interested in this part of code and so

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,279
on but i must admit

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,920
that i think that i fully

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,279
guarded the community over code approach

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,720
during the apache con last year

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,920
because then i was able to meet

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,959
other apache airflow contributors and

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,000
that was amazing because i was able to

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,360
see that they are like me

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,279
we are just people who love enjoy the

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,480
life and we are smailing and we just

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
want to improve

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:03,120
software and lives of the others

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,560
and i also meet apart from apache

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
airflow team i also meet

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
people who are contributing to open

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
source longer than i live like 20 years

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,959
25 26 or more

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,760
and then i understand that there is

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,839
more behind the open source that it's

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,160
really the people who make the code

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,720
because the codes without the people

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,240
will die and if there is no one to

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,639
maintain the project

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,040
then no one will use it because the

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,480
project will die

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,000
and the next lesson is uh

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,240
quite related to this and i think

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,120
the next lesson is quite hard for young

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,040
people unless

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
i think it's it's some moments it was

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,480
hard for me

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,000
because it's about value the people not

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,959
the codes or any other contributions

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,760
because at the beginning of a carrier

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,000
you may feel

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,360
attached to your code your contribution

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,639
to your logo

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,560
to anything you create but

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,320
you have to remember that the code may

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,720
change that the

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,800
logo may change that the design of the

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,959
page may change in the future

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,959
so you don't you shouldn't be attached

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,000
to that to match

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,720
and you have to remember that

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,680
there is a lot of people and not every

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,399
idea or suggestion can be accepted

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,800
because it is the community it is people

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,240
who create the community who accept

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,519
and reject the idea suggestion

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,320
improvement proposals and we are doing

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
this

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,360
because we have the best interest of the

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
project in our hearts

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,120
and this is the way the apache software

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,000
foundation project works we are voting

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,839
we are selecting the best approach

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,320
so the tip is to not get too attached to

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,720
the

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,120
codes logo or any type of contribution

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,839
you do

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
here is an example for here is a story

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,240
from

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,519
from my life when i was working on the

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,720
proof of concept for uh and and software

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,440
uh part of the apache airflow

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
and i spent one week doing uh some

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,040
research

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,880
learning a lot and having fun in general

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,320
and but after this week we as a

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,120
community we agreed that

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,680
no we will not accept this we don't need

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,720
it because

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,120
the current solution

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,920
just meet few changes and it will be

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,959
perfect

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,279
it will be more than what i created

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,639
and i was like okay i spent only a week

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,440
it was really fun

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,040
i've learned a lot but my friend dan

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
spent three months and doing something

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,560
similar

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,759
but in the end we also abandoned his

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,759
approach

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,720
because we all understood that

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,440
both approaches mai and dan are not

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,360
better that's what we have now

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
and we all accepted that our code will

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,440
be abandoned

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,040
that was probably not that easy we know

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,120
that we have to do this and

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,959
yes this was the the best way for the

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,399
community but

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,680
i i suppose there was a moment of uh wow

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,519
if i would know but i think it's

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,399
not only the code but in every

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,880
profession whatever you do

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,600
we we have to learn to accept the best

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,160
possible

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
solution best possible option because

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,199
only in this way

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,399
the project will stay up but will be up

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
to date and will be

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,959
really evolving and there will be less

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,160
problems

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:39,680
even if this approach this

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:43,040
best approach is not yours or is

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,560
suggested by someone who you don't like

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:50,480
and this move this moves us to

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,839
to the seventh lesson which is uh

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,600
about the big picture and here by the

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,959
big picture i mean that

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,920
open source has many parts

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,839
and only by contributing to the open

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,799
source and being part of the open source

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,600
community

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,559
you can see how all of them are

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,760
connected

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,400
and how all of them are required for the

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,039
success of the project

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,039
and first of them is of course code we

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,439
cannot deny that the code is required in

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,559
the

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,880
software world and because this is the

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,720
thing that makes the project work

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
but the second thing that is not always

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,280
obvious is that there are stakeholders

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,679
we have we have users we have

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,480
contributors and we have companies

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,280
that are somehow related to the users to

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,559
the

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,679
uh contributors of course in the apache

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,240
software foundation

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,440
everyone is an individual so the

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,799
companions don't have

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,240
that much power about the over the uh

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,640
over the project itself but it happens

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
that

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,559
many people are from one company and a

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,840
bunch of other peoples are

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,720
from the other company and even the

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,760
individuals may have

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,039
different views and different interests

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,600
in developing the project so

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,640
we need the decision-making process we

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,200
need the process

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
of consensus seeking which is done on

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,679
the dev list

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
during the discussion during the

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
planning during

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,880
exchanging ideas and suggestions

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
because we are discussing possible

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,960
options

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
ways we can choose to make to find the

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,520
best

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:35,200
possible solution and in this process

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,000
all those diverse people start to work

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,760
together

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,720
to search for the best possible option

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,520
that will be finally implement accepted

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,880
voted accepted and then implemented and

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,919
in this way the code that is produced in

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,320
the end

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,080
i think is just the mer side effect of

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,679
this process of this process of

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,280
bringing people together during

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,000
discussion and consensus seeking

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,679
and there are two more things about this

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,880
big picture

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,080
idea first is that you

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
don't you shouldn't be afraid to ask or

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,760
suggest

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,039
voicing your concern in open source

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,880
community helps community to understand

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,120
that there may be a problems for some

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,400
users and this is really

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,039
really really important for us because

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,440
we don't know every edge case we don't

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,880
know

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:34,160
every users we are unable to do this so

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,080
getting a feedback over an idea over a

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,880
improvement proposal from users is

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,120
really important for us and

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,039
don't be afraid to suggest tools

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,600
improvements to the documentation or

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,080
using some linters or things that will

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,960
or processes that will improve the way

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,320
our community works it's always welcome

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,919
to see that

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,160
someone doesn't agree with the current

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,840
way of doing the project that there can

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
be that there is a place for the

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
improvement

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,600
and the second thing is something

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,600
that i think is hard to practice

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,840
but we have to practice this in open

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,320
source

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,080
it's about disagree but engage

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
this is something that i learned from my

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,159
friend jarek who is

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
always repeating this and he is good at

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,919
that

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,480
uh the disagree about the engage role is

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,640
about

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,880
believing that the open source project

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,799
is always going in the best possible

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,600
decision it as i said

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,240
it doesn't have to be your ideal

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,919
solution

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,280
it doesn't have to be the way you would

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,080
love to go

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,960
but if the majority of project voted

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,760
that we are going

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,039
this way and you said no i don't like it

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,440
i'm a living

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
that's that's not good i would say

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,280
that's

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,799
like you didn't believe in the project

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,080
because if you believe in the project

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
you will disagree with

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,480
you will you are okay to disagree with

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,799
people but still if you love the project

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,960
if you

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,159
really you are really interested in the

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,400
project you will still

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,400
engage in making in a better place

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,440
but all of that i think may be

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,880
interesting uh

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,960
to do here and maybe even inspiring but

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
there is a question that pops in my head

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,000
from time to time and

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:27,200
it's um it's about

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,600
how people from outside the open source

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,280
should

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,640
know it all like like i said previously

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,720
when i was

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,760
working outside open source i didn't

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,520
know anything

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:44,000
about what i'm talking today

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,480
but i think there is a one uh

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,159
one lesson that helps us to understand

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,919
what can be improved

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,799
around spreading the knowledge and the

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,840
way of the apache way the the way of

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,159
open source

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
to the others to the those people who

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,480
are outside

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,360
open source now and this is

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,039
about learning and teaching first of all

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,679
we should learn from the

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,200
uh newcomers to the projects from the

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,159
people who are contributing for the

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,000
first time

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,320
because they are like validating

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,960
that our community contribution guides

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,080
that our code of conduct or anything

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,960
is okay and that we provide

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,720
enough information about how the things

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,559
work in the open source

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,880
on the other hand we have to teach

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,320
people because only by the teaching

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,000
we are able to share the knowledge

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,760
and sharing the knowledge is really

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,480
crucial for the open source project

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,600
because

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,480
if people will understand how

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,400
things work in this project and how open

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,400
source work in the general

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
they will be able to share this

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,760
knowledge with the others

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,840
and in this way the community the amount

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,400
of people that are able to

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,400
speak and manage the project will grow

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,159
and the next thing is that we need to

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,159
support people

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,320
we need to support users we need to

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,320
support contributors because

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,960
if we don't give them helping hand

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,600
they will go away from the open source

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,000
they will go away from the project

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,919
the experience from we need to remember

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,559
that the experience from one community

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
will be

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:32,880
carried to another so if someone

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:36,880
feels that is unwelcome in one community

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,200
he may feel that they are not welcome

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,159
in open source at all and that's

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,000
something that we

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,120
definitely don't want we want people to

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,039
feel that they are welcome in the open

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,159
source and that they are free to voice

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,080
their concern

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,600
ideas and any possible

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,760
things that can be implemented in the

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,120
project but

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,200
having the sharing knowledge and

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,360
supporting people we need also

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
spreading the word about the open source

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,880
because

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,080
the only way to share the knowledge is

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,679
talking about it

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,200
it's writing and it could be blog post

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,080
and and taking the conferences and so on

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,600
but i think it's also important to talk

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,799
with your friends if you have software

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,400
engineers or people that

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,720
can be interested in the open source

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,760
it's amazing to talk with them because

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,559
as i said people think that the open

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,279
source is

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,679
much more different place than people

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,120
think

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:37,600
that that it's in reality

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,520
my friends were really surprised yeah

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,400
when i started to work in polydia and

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,240
being engaged in the open source because

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,200
they like me thought that this is the

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,720
place where we will

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,000
be able to enter in few years

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,760
because we need some experience and now

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,159
i can see that those same

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440
people my friends are more willing to

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,960
contribute

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,880
back fix or fixing a typo in the

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,960
documentation it's not that they are

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,000
starting to finding those things no

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,880
they they saw them in the past

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,520
now they know that they should quickly

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,919
appear

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,799
and improve the community and what is

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,080
more they are

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,240
also seeing that if they want to learn

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,320
for example new programming language

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
they can find an open source project

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,279
written in it

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,799
and just start contributing and learn

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,799
from the experts

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,520
not on their own but from people who

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:35,200
know what they do

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,919
and finally i think that that if you

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,720
don't know

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,400
how the open source looks like it's

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,200
really hard to engage

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,360
it's really hard to become a part of

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,960
something that is unknown to us

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,679
if we don't know how the communities

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,240
works and how the open source work

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,600
will not be able to join any open source

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,640
project

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,200
so the next thing the next lesson i

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,880
i think is is really important is about

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,679
creating and

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,480
looking for an opportunity to engage

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,520
people

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,320
in the open source of course we as a

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,799
communities we should do meetups we

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,520
should

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,720
write documentation blogs the workshops

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,120
we should spread

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,320
our knowledge into in every way we can

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,600
but here i would love to focus on

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,240
something

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,000
else something that is that can be done

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,760
externally

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,760
and i want to talk about the

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,880
opportunities that can be created by

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,960
companies because previously when i

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,640
was outside the the open source i always

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,720
thought that

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,880
that's companies doesn't support open

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,240
source but it's not true

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,200
so first of all i think that if you have

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,600
really used

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,520
open source software open source open

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,320
source tools

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,640
i think that you should consider giving

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,600
your

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,400
employees some time to contribute or

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,679
even

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,400
open sourcing your internal code because

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
in this way this code this tool can be

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,360
improved

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,159
and of course you will gain some fame

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,480
about being

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,320
part of the open source but i'm also

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,799
sure that you will learn a lot

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
doing open source that we in polydia

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,840
have a few

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,799
our own uh bluetooth libraries that are

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,240
open source and

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,960
we are learning a lot but speaking about

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,200
fame

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,159
i think this is really really valid

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
point because

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,320
for example the app everyone who is uh

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,559
user of the apache airflow

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,399
probably knows that apache airflow was

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,679
first created in the

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,840
airbnb as a internal project and then

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,919
almost open sources to the apache

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,880
software foundation

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,640
but apart from giving back i think we

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,640
should also ask for

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,760
a possibility to contribute to open

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,360
source

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,360
and i think that many employers

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,679
don't think about giving back to open

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,399
source so probably if you know that

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
you would love to try this and that you

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,240
know that you have some

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
code that can be open sources internally

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,760
or that you

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,840
would love to improve the project you

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,600
use i suggest you to

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,600
speak with your employer and suggest

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,240
that hey i would love to

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,320
spend some time on doing the open source

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,520
and i know that

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,760
some companies even in poland have

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,640
something that is called open source

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,640
friday

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,760
or uh once a month uh open source

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,320
uh open source hackathon i think

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
asking for possibility to contribute in

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,000
your

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,039
work time is is a really good idea

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,440
because

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,399
doing the open source you can gain a lot

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
you will learn

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,960
more and you will gain new skills and

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,720
all of that leads us to the

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,919
last lesson of my talk

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,399
which is about the fact that you can be

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,880
paid for the open source work

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,679
it's true that the majority of

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,480
contributors

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
is comes from the the the majority of

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,360
contributions

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,880
comes from people who do this in their

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,000
free time

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,799
but well established projects

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,120
needs paid maintainers because it's i

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,559
think

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,799
it's the only guarantee of the

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,760
maintenance of the project and

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,240
quarantine of

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,360
future of this project without that the

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,039
project will die

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,520
and people will be left alone so

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,520
having people who are paid at least for

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,279
a few hours for maintaining this project

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,440
is really really important

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,960
we need to understand that open source

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,440
is done in the

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,159
by people's hands it's not generated

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,440
that's people behind the open source

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,520
and as i said you can be

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
paid for the open source in the

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,720
full-time manner as

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,799
i'm i am and few other companies also do

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,559
this it's red hot google microsoft and

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,000
my company polodia

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,480
but also it can be paid for the

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,080
uh for the path time like i said it's

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,240
really amazing idea

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,240
to ask um for

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,600
uh for the for the possibility to work

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,200
on open source in the in the

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,840
on fridays on once one one day a week

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,559
but as you can see those campanis it's

00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,520
not like they

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,399
have enough money to pay for doing open

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,080
source

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,679
i think there's something more it's

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,840
something that

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,000
those companies have in common and it's

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,360
that they understand

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,760
that the open source

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,440
runs everywhere what we create in open

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,120
source especially in the apache software

00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,080
foundation

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,559
powers every company around the world

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,640
and

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,360
i think that's by funding and being

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,440
actively involved in the opera service

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:57,440
we gain as much as we give

00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,480
and this is the last lesson uh

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,679
of of the ten lessons of the uh

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,880
of that that i've learned in the

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:11,039
last year doing open source full time or

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,159
even more 24 hours a day sometimes

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:18,799
if you would ask me what is the

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,600
most important lesson from of those 10

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,240
i would say it's uh the third one the

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,760
that the

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,559
open source is a great place to learn

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,880
i think it's more important to know than

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,279
the community over code approach because

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,399
once you know that the open source is a

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,519
safe place to learn

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,919
and to grow you will learn

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,200
with time being about this community

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,039
over code approach and

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,480
you will be able to appreciate this

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,080
approach

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,480
but this lesson also allows you to learn

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
more you will once you know that you can

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,000
learn in open source you will learn

00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,080
everything i mentioned and even more

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,960
and that's all that i have for you today

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,000
i would like to say big thank you to

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,039
everyone who was

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,360
here with me and now i think that we

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:12,480
still have a few minutes for

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,880
questions so if you have any

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,600
please put them in the chat and i'm

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,159
happy to

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,159
to answer

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:29,840
thank you

00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,960
i see that's there there is a uh

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,880
i'm not sure about the the the the

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,640
message from owen but yeah it happens

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,640
that sometimes when you do contribution

00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,399
it's not always accepted and

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,840
i think it's really important to

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,440
emphasize uh

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,480
that we need to take

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,120
another look for like being young

00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,840
in the open source allow you to see what

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,600
problems

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,840
young people and people who are not

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,640
related to open search

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,320
meet on their road to becoming open

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,840
source contributors uh

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,760
i see the question about are you

00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,200
mentoring others now to help them on

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,279
their open source journey

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,279
yes i'm trying to do this i'm trying to

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,399
share as much as i've learned from the

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,080
open source by

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,480
speaking the conferences writing blog

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,519
post urls and also as i mentioned

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,399
sharing my knowledge with everyone in my

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,559
case about

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,240
it's mostly about designers and software

00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,320
engineers but i

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,559
love to spread the awareness that open

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,880
source is for everyone

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,720
and if i would have a possibility to to

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,960
help someone with uh

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,480
with open source and bringing them to to

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
the open source i'm really happy to do

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,840
this

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,919
of course i'm not mentioning the uh the

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,559
they're viewing peers and

00:33:49,919 --> 00:34:07,519
helping people with in the apache

00:33:52,559 --> 00:34:10,800
airflow community

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:13,440
i think that okay so i will

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,440
i will read the the question so do you

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,520
have some advice on deepening

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,480
your knowledge on the code base any tips

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,879
you have learned

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,679
the greatest tip is to read the code uh

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,399
but i think the the good starting point

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,359
is to

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,440
review the peers uh to see how people

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,280
what is changing now

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,879
but then if you want to deepen the

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,760
knowledge you you have to play with the

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,520
code base

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,960
an example in the patch airflow we are

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,359
always laughing uh

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,879
in our company that you need six months

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,320
to understand how the apache airflow

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,000
works under the hood

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,560
and this is really true because there is

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,960
a you first of all needs to

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,040
play with the tool and once you play and

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,720
you see observe a problems or you are

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,560
interested how the things work

00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,839
you start looking in the documentation

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,839
and then in the code

00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:03,920
personally now i'm always looking at the

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,760
code because this gives me the full

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,760
understanding of how things work

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,079
and the the second the another question

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,760
is how do you start from

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,480
picking a project to making your first

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,119
comment in the project this is quite

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,160
interesting because

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,160
now i'm picking projects uh

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,320
i'm not picking projects because as

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,119
usual the project i contribute are

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,520
somehow related to what i've heard or to

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,960
what i saw over the internet so for

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
example there was a

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,119
i was uh at the conference last year at

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,320
the

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,800
warsaw cloud native warsaw uh where i

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,000
heard about project which is called kida

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,480
and i started i and we needed some from

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,640
kida

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,079
in the uh apache airport so i decided

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,839
like wow this is

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,000
that can be interesting opportunity to

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,040
contribute there also i wanted to

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,320
learn going so i started to look

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,119
uh around the the code base i understand

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,680
something

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,560
and then i i tried just to open peer and

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,560
get some feedback

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,440
but i think it's if you are not uh

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,000
i think it's it's okay to select

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,640
projects that are

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,040
smaller but comes from foundations i

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,119
think

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,359
from my perspective i think that the

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,280
apache software foundation have

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,680
for me a better feeling or as a

00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:35,200
community than for example cncf projects

00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,640
uh is is apache incubator the best place

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,040
to start

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,160
i think uh if you are considering to

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,400
donating the project

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,400
yes this is the only place you can start

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,839
in the apache solar foundation

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,599
uh if you want just to start

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,119
contributing i think that any open

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,000
source project is good place

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,119
that what i value when i look for the

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,119
project is that

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,359
i see that the community is active and

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,760
that the community helps the others

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,240
because without that engaging with these

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,760
communities will be hard and

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:09,040
as i'm maintaining one project uh

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,320
i not always have time

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,400
to to to to to to to to work with the

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,760
other projects and changing things and

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,960
improving i

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,280
i think it's it's okay but i always try

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,280
to

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,560
to point to to give some feedback or

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,400
leave some feedback

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:37,119
that's i think that some things can be

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:39,599
improved in the contribution process

00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,599
thank you

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,079
i think that's we still have uh three

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,440
minutes

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,480
i think so i'm happy to

00:37:47,440 --> 00:38:05,839
to answer

00:37:50,480 --> 00:38:05,839
thank you swapnil

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
so

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:47,839
thank you eric

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,839
yeah i i definitely agree that you

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,560
should

00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,040
uh attend the the the talk of jarek

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,200
potuk tomorrow at the apache con because

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,119
here it will tell more about what we do

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,280
in the apache airflow to

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,720
make the community our community more

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,599
welcoming and i think

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,240
uh this is the lessons i was able to

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,960
learn is

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:29,839
in many parts due to being part of the

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:29,839
apache airflow

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,119
so

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,280
okay so if there is no more question i

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:57,839
think that we can

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:57,839
end this session sooner

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,839
oh uh i i will be sharing the the

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,520
my presentation with uh on the drive of

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,240
the apache console

00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,960
jose if you have missed something please

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,960
take a look at the

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,839
presentation

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,319
yes and the stock is going to be

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,240
recorded and will be available on the

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,240
isf youtube channel

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,400
okay so thank you one more time everyone

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,640
i hope you

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
enjoyed this and it was a real pleasure

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,520
to be able to speak for the first time

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,800
at the

00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,800
apache con even if it's online see you

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
all

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,640
