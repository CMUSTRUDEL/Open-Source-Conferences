Description: 
	From no open source experience to Apache Member and PMC of Commons
Rob Tompkins

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020
https://apachecon.com/acah2020/

Between 2016 and 2019 I went from having not made any Apache contributions to being on the PMC of Apache Commons. I will tell my story here and give insights about how the Apache Way works. This talk has been previously given at the DC Apache Roadshow with a positive response.

I am a software developer and mathematician from Richmond, Virginia who happens to be an Apache Member and am on the PMC of Apache Commons. I also particularly enjoy outdoor adventure sports for those interested.

[Music]

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,230
[Music]

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,119
so welcome folks

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,640
uh my name is rob tompkins uh

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,719
and um i'm gonna tell my story about how

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
i got involved with the apache software

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,920
foundation

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,360
in hopes that it uh lessens people's

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
apprehension with getting involved in

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,520
open source

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,120
uh projects because um

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,039
i i feel like a lot of people out there

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,000
think that uh you know the

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,199
the code bases are are so profound and

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
um

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,960
and vital to the ecosystem that uh

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,160
touching them is

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,640
is terrifying and um i mean

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
i've broken my fair share of stuff and

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,479
we can use the

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,520
all the help we can get so um with that

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,479
i'll uh

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,400
i'll introduce myself um so i'm from

00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,040
richmond virginia um

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,759
born and raised in richmond uh going

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,600
back a couple

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,840
a couple generations here actually so

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,040
i'm i'm really stuck

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
um but uh in in school i did a bunch of

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,600
mathematics

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,640
and mathematical logic and over the past

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,840
10 years i've done development in java

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
python

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
devops and security and a bunch of cloud

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,280
stuff

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,960
um i've worked in the financial sector

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,920
a good bit i've worked a little bit for

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,960
state government i've worked in um

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,000
e-commerce and most recently i've been

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,079
doing work in the transportation sector

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,719
um in richmond it's kind of hard to

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,320
stay out of the financial sector so i've

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,719
done a considerable amount there

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,399
particularly with capital one

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,079
and um i am currently on the project

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,840
management committee for apache commons

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,000
and i'm an apache member and just

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,400
recently i've been appointed to

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
be the uh jakarta ee relationship

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,599
manager

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,160
at um apache so that should be fun um

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,480
it'll be a fun new experience for me

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
and if you guys are into adventure

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
sports i don't know

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
who out there may or may not be into

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
adventure sports but uh i do a whole lot

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,440
of

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,040
mountain biking rock climbing and white

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
water kayaking uh

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,720
the white water kayaking's kind of i put

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,319
i put a little bit by the wayside

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
because it's a bit dangerous

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,000
but um that's who i am so the next

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,560
question

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,280
is uh and i i posted this

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
um when i was talking at the dc road

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
show in 2019

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,599
and i didn't know who might be in the

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
audience but you know does anyone not

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,800
know

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
what an open source project is and uh

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
one would hope that because you're at

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
apache con you you would indeed know

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,159
what an open source project is

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,800
um but if you don't there is

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,680
opensource.org and opensource.org has

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
faqs

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,640
and um if you go to osd and that's the

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
open source definition

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,959
um it clearly defines well it mostly

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,080
clearly defines what an open source

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,360
project is and for

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,720
for all intents and purposes it just

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,159
is a project where the code base is

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,360
readable minimally at

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,360
time of artifact delivery

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,519
we at the apache software foundation

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
like to have the code bases be a little

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,159
bit more open than that and

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,840
accessible to the general public um

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
so since i spend so much time on apache

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,519
commons

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,599
uh the question would then be what is

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,920
the apache commons project right

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:55,040
and we're essentially the project

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,560
that houses all of the shared code

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,680
across the apache projects um

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,040
we came out of jakarta

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,519
which was the java project

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,680
that um was originally housing all of

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,200
the java code at apache and

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,239
uh back in 2007

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,320
or 2008 somewhere in that time frame

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,960
uh it was decided that housing

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,960
a collection of projects based upon a

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,160
language

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,880
would not be the best idea and housing

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,759
projects

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,680
based upon intent uh was a better idea

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
so they split up jakarta commons it went

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,000
into the attic in 2011

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,000
and jakarta commons which was the shared

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,040
libraries across all the java projects

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
ended up in apache commons

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,600
and oddly enough the eclipse foundation

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
recently co-opted the

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,720
jakarta name and uh

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,919
are using it for their java project so

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,000
the jakarta ee project

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,680
is now the java ee project which is

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
which is kind of cool that they took our

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,440
name and

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,360
um you know moved it forward

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,120
so what else is commons do our current

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,320
mission is to provide a place for the

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,720
asf to you know collaborate and

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
despite the fact that the majority of

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
our code bases are java

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,280
we are not close-minded to other

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,120
languages for example there's c and some

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,800
of our code bases for example commons

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,160
crypto

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,440
shims down into open ssl using c code

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,880
and i'm open

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,120
to if people need a common place to put

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,440
code across a couple tlps at

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,960
the apache software foundation that they

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,400
um

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,080
contact us at commons and and and

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
throw the code base in and and something

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,880
that affords people the luxury of being

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,600
able to do that is that commons has uh

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,919
repeatedly tried to make it clear that

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,639
we encourage any apache committer to

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,560
come over

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
and request commit rights and we'll just

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
grant them to you so if you have commit

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,919
rights

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,720
on i don't know spark or something like

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,720
that then

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
come on over and say i'd like to

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
contribute to

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
commons lang or commons io

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
and we'll give you commit rights and

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,440
we'll go from there so

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,639
what does apache commons look like today

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
it's 33 independent java projects

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
the most popular projects based on the

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,160
github star algorithm

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,680
are lang io collections

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,160
math and pool and surprisingly math is

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,120
in there we've had some uh

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,240
some community snafus in the math area

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
and lost some folks

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,720
and i think we've been making some

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,120
progress over the last

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,880
little while at rebuilding the community

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
and being a little bit more open-minded

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,000
to the math folks and trying to help

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,039
them move forward so that we continue to

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
have a thriving

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,160
uh community of math folks

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,520
so what are the benefits of open source

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,199
software and that's

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,120
uh something that i try to preach at my

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,880
day job because

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,720
a lot of times they lose sight of it and

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,000
think that uh you know it's just free

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
software

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,039
and um end up writing a whole lot of

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,400
their own libraries internally in

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,720
the same fashion as open source software

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,520
would be written but um

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,160
are in instead internal libraries but

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,680
it's the standard asian of library so

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,720
uh think about the the screw

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,160
um for a machine back in the 1800s if

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,680
your machine broke

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,080
you had to go out to the blacksmith

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,440
and take him the broken screw from your

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,120
machine and be like i need another one

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,000
of these can you can you please

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,400
put another one of these together for me

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
and

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
um they would make you a new screw and

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,919
you put it in your machine

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,520
and around the turn of the the

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,960
19th into the 20th century people were

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,319
like yeah why don't we just uh

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,240
come up with a standard blueprint and

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,599
make screws and then machines will take

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,800
those screws and

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,039
it'll just work so um for example if you

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,599
need a string utils out there

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,440
in the java area then odds are you're

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,680
probably going to either come to

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
apache commons or you're going to end up

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,160
in the spring frameworks

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,080
string utils which is effectively

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,319
analogous to ours but i mean that's only

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,599
two places to go as opposed to

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,880
you know hundreds of places to go

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,200
uh more eyes is fewer bugs uh the only

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,800
good

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
test environments production guys

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,159
whether you like it or not

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,640
and um simply because the generation of

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
the combinatorial possibilities

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,320
necessary to tease all the bugs out is

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,440
only available in production

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
so more eyes fewer bugs more people are

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,800
using the library so the

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,800
the the bugs get teased out and so

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
you're more likely to have stable code

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,720
that if it's open source

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
and properly maintained so you need to

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,040
also

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
ensure that there's a community of folks

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
behind it because if you've got just one

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,959
guy out there maintaining it

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,279
then who knows how quickly the bugs will

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,320
get fixed

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
and you get long-term support we

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,760
subscribed to the

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,800
developer got hit by a bus syndrome

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,720
uh problem and that's the

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
problem of if somebody on the project

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
gets hit by a bus which

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,080
you know there they're better ways to

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
say that right uh we could say developer

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
wins the

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,399
lottery syndrome but it's been

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
classically termed the developer hit by

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,560
bus syndrome

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,480
uh if if that uh if that happens we need

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,120
to make sure the project goes forward so

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,120
uh apache has it as one of their core

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,040
tenants that

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:57,440
the project community should be thriving

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,680
sufficiently thriving that if someone

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,000
goes radio silent the the project

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
continues moving forward and continues

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,360
to have support

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,920
and that's an extremely important

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,600
feature

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,120
in my mind um when i came onto apache

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,959
commons one of the big guys on the

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,079
project was benedict ritter

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,600
and he's since moved on to uh gradle and

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
does a lot of work for them but he

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,720
coined

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,600
a uh a definition when i was at apache

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
con

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,440
in 2016 or actually it's a law that he

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,720
came up with that

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
that i particularly like so uh so i

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
i include it in the talk just just for

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,920
funsies and that's that uh everything

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,839
that's not part of our domain or

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
business logic or the crazy legacy

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,760
systems which

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,959
we need to integrate with has already

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
been developed by

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,320
somebody much smarter than we are right

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,480
and so

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,000
that goes back to the standardization

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,120
thing why would i want to go into my

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,640
backyard and

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,079
and well i i use my backyard as my wood

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
shop but why would i

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,360
use my backyard and go out there and be

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,480
like i need a new bolt i'm going to go

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,160
machine it myself

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,240
i mean there'd be some interesting uh

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,360
learnings from the exercise of doing

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
that but

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,440
but i can go to the store and buy the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,200
bolt

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,959
and put it into whatever i need to put

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
it into fairly quickly and easily so the

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,800
idea there is don't reinvent the wheel

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
right

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,399
so the question becomes why did i get

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,959
involved

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,519
and this is a bit of a funny story so i

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,560
in

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,519
2016 in march of 2016 my second daughter

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,279
was being born

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,560
and i was like i'm gonna have a little

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,640
bit of time during paternity leave

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,120
i'm gonna start doing open source

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
development i think it's a great idea

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,480
um in hindsight that might might not

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
have been the best time to get involved

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,000
but i did have

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,959
you know some some free hours here and

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,560
there that

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,399
weren't occupied by my day job

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
and the other thing that i was

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,959
particularly interested

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,480
in was keeping my mathematical

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,279
background

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,760
sharp um i've been out of school then

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,040
for

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,440
almost seven years eight years

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,440
and

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,920
i felt rusty i felt rusty um

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,920
granted writing code kind of keeps your

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
mathematical logic up to snuff

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,120
but um even still i wanted to make sure

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,959
that i could get in there and do

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,279
derivatives appropriately

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,800
and you know do the do the statistics

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,000
appropriately

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,079
and um maintain

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
my standard mathematical ideas that you

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,440
would think of as

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
you know the undergraduate math classes

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,519
you would take

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,040
and so i got involved for that um

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,880
i got involved because i thought career

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,399
advancement would be uh

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,800
would be a thing that would would come

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,880
out of it it's it's kind of been but

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,959
kind of not been i've unfortunately been

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,880
in a lot of circumstances where

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,959
uh people have admonished me

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,639
for doing open source work because

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:01,600
despite my doing it in my own time

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,440
if i were to put it into my review they

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
saw the list of items in my review and

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,800
they said hey

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:12,000
30 of this is is stuff that's not

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,880
on my intent list why are you doing that

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,920
why am i not getting that bandwidth and

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
um

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,839
i found that it's prudent to just not

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,920
tell people what i'm doing in the open

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,160
source world unfortunately

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,240
i've been kind of stung by that a couple

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,440
times now

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
but having my work out there in the

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,279
public domain

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,120
i can because i interview particularly

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,639
poorly at places i can point to code

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
that i've written and be like listen if

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
you want to see the kind of code that i

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,000
write

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,079
here it is it's gpg signed by me

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,360
so it's mine um

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,399
and so i i use it to my advantage still

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,040
and i particularly enjoy the fact that

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,560
i'm not constrained by timelines okay

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:02,800
uh i can take my time

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,720
on a problem and do it to the

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
to the point where i feel like i've done

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
it right

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,680
and that's something that my day job

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,600
has never afforded me i it's always get

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,199
it done get it out the door get to the

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
next thing now

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,880
and i mean that's just the nature of

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,120
profit-driven business i suppose

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
so

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
what does an arbitrary person do to get

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,680
involved what would you do

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,639
um pick a subject that you're passionate

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,800
about uh

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,959
like i said i particularly enjoyed math

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,399
so i actually grabbed the guys on

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,760
commons math and were like how can i

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
help with commons math

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,920
um and they gave me some good

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,760
suggestions

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,959
uh another thing you can do is pick a

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,000
project that you're

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,959
actively using at work and

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
that actually would help probably with

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,920
the intent

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
problem that i have because apache

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,320
commons is

00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,800
is particularly low level

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
relative to standard application

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,320
development

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,839
and so the folks that i work with don't

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
see the fact that they're

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,560
using apache commons virtually

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
everywhere

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,160
and that it still needs to be maintained

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,839
and so they just think of it as that

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,199
free code out there that we

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,959
need not contribute to and c'est la vie

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,959
i i still manage through that and it's

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,079
no big deal

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,959
and check on the

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,639
get stats page um gets changed a little

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,720
bit but you can find the contributors

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,399
page or the committers page

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,199
and you can see who's actively

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,240
committing to a project and find their

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,320
contact information

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,120
i mean you if i were to go out here and

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,199
look at this is commons lang i believe

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,680
and this is what uh this is in october

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,120
of 18 okay so this is this is a bit old

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,199
but i can go out here and i can be like

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
oh well there's gary gregory and

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,519
benedict ritter

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:02,320
and seb and i can

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,320
hop into then the

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,040
mailing list if you guys see this uh

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
the the this is a bit small maybe for

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,320
some folks but uh

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,320
if you go out and you go to commons

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,399
mailing lists you can subscribe to the

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,160
mailing list and then i could go back

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,000
right and find these guys who are

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,759
emailing the mailing list on a regular

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,519
basis and i can find their email and i

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,959
could email them personally and be like

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,720
how can i get involved and um generally

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,720
people have pretty good suggestions

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,279
so find the mailing list uh use the

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,240
readme.md

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,839
uh this is a link to the readme.md in in

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,360
lang

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,120
the readme has got a bunch of really

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
valuable information in it we

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,880
keep our readmes up to date we actually

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
use a maven plugin to keep them up to

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
date so

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,000
they're automatically generated from a

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,279
template that we

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,880
regularly update email someone directly

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,519
like i said

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,880
so those are some some quick and easy

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,240
ways that you can

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,240
get involved how

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,000
do you then figure out what to work on

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,880
well if you if you're working with it in

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,640
your day job then you probably have some

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,839
bugs that you've teased out or something

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,160
like that that uh

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,360
that you kind of have a good bead on

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
where the bugs are and what you could

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,760
potentially contribute

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
and so contributing you know jiras and

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,880
patches in that fashion

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
is an easy way to get started but if

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,640
you're trying to get into something new

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
and fresh that you've never really waded

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,240
into

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,120
well nobody's got perfect unit test

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,400
coverage right

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,480
nobody if they do then i don't know

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,000
that that project's strange but i don't

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
know of any project that's got perfect

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,919
unit test coverage for example

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,760
uh one of the the most heavily used

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,480
database connection pooling

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,320
uh projects is commons dbcp it was the

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
default for the spring framework for a

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,720
long time

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,320
and in the fall of 18

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,960
the test coverage was about 45

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,960
and so you know we we've we've improved

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,080
it since then but

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,640
you know there's always room for tests

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,200
uh documentation's also a good place

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
here's my

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
statement you know no one's got 100 test

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
coverage there are some people that have

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
test coverage but like i said they're

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,960
they're weird um

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
find a ticket my first major condition

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
contribution was this

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,960
ticket which was

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:39,039
it was the fact that

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,559
parse integer in

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,840
java 7 differs from

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:50,640
parse integer in java 8

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,840
and thus commonslang has a parse number

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,400
and depending upon the underlying

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,520
version of java you're using you get

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
different results out of parse number um

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,120
if you had a

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
leading

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,720
i think if you had leading zeros in

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,080
front of the decimal sign with a

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,240
negative sign or something like that

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,039
things would fall apart

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,640
um with parse number it wasn't personal

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,480
i guess it was par saw

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,640
parse double not parse integer but um

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,840
or if you put zeros before an integer or

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,600
something like that things would fall

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,760
over so i had to predicate

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,039
which version of java you're actually

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,039
running and do

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,799
different parsing mechanics based upon

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,840
the different versions of java that was

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,080
running

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
and um with the completion of that

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,200
ticket

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,799
they actually voted me in and gave me uh

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
commit privileges

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,919
and no that was after four months of

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
writing tests so i i did that in the

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,840
fall of 16

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,840
and i had been writing tests since march

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,640
so how does one

00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:00,120
start integrating themselves into

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:03,280
our apache communities uh

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,039
open-mindedness tolerance

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,600
understanding that a lot of the folks

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,640
out there on these lists

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,679
are english as a second language

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,720
speakers um

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,480
those are all at least

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,559
ideas that you should have in your head

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
when you wait in let me let me hop over

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,120
and make sure that i'm not missing any

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,159
questions here people could have asked

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,919
questions

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,360
how do you get started with open source

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,559
prior to contribution

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,080
if no such prior experience with that

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,200
uh do you have he really had

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,120
time during i did have time during

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,880
fraternity leave it actually worked out

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,679
and um and uh

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,520
surgeon uh i i'm i think i'm heading

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,799
towards your question now

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,559
um so uh hopefully uh

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,159
we'll get there and pardon the infinite

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,880
recursion on the screen that's kind of

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,880
fun

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
[Laughter]

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,039
um i'll head back over to the slides now

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,120
um but yeah yeah thomas i i

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,280
it somehow worked out even even through

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,400
the paternity leave that it that it uh

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,520
that i i i

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,880
that i got involved in uh i don't know

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,559
now my daughters are four and six and

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,320
they still require

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,760
lots of my time but um

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,919
read all the documentation on the

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,799
project uh reading the documentation is

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
important

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,200
that's how i figured out how to do most

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,200
of the stuff with apache commons people

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,840
didn't tell me how to

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
uh

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,720
help other folks get commits in after i

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,799
got commit rights you know

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,640
somebody opens a pull request how do i

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,760
help them get the pull request in well

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,520
there are a couple of different places

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,799
that we document all the different stuff

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,919
and it took me a little while to figure

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
out exactly

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,760
you know how to maintain our changes xml

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,880
and

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,840
how to effectively make sure that the

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,039
the work is attributed to an individual

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,960
um

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
don't be afraid to weigh in on the

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,480
mailing list but uh do be polite

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,679
do be polite um i i try my hardest to be

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,080
polite

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,480
even if i'm quite frustrated with people

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,679
i i have um

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,120
i have times of frustration and i

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:24,000
tend to vent one-on-one with somebody

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,600
and then get my venting done

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
a lot of times it's my wife that hears

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,559
me venting right so

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,320
it's not even somebody on the project so

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,559
i try to get the venting done

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,080
and then i try to go back to the email

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,880
and be like okay

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,440
well how can i help with your problem

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,039
and how can we move in this direction

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,679
and i try to

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,000
offer if somebody has a problem with

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,039
something i try to offer my help

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,320
with their particular uh project

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,559
uh particularly if i disagree

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,200
with the tactics that they're taking so

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,440
i'll offer a dissenting opinion

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,320
give suggestions and then tell them i'm

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,559
willing to help

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,600
after all of that right and i feel like

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,200
that helps

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,159
hold people in the community because

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,760
they see me say something negative

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,240
and then see me follow along with

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,120
helping the person doing the exact same

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,120
that i'm

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,159
exact thing that i'm suggesting against

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,600
okay

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:29,200
and i'll do on the the

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,400
portions of commons the the

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,559
i'll adhere to my tenants and

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,919
i'll use those as examples for other

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,200
people and be like well here's how we

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,480
did it over here

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,679
but i'm not going to try to you know

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,720
change you as a person all i can do

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,520
is show by exam or lead by example and

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,320
then

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,279
help even though i'm frustrated with the

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,760
mechanics

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,559
of the way things are going there

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,159
because

00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:01,440
even still the pro the the um

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,200
project needs to move forward so even if

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
i'm frustrated with somebody

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,880
their stuff needs to get up and out the

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,120
door so i try to

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720
you know set the frustration aside leave

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
it with my dissenting opinion

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,559
and help the person move the project

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,840
forward because that's just the right

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,120
thing to do

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
um and if you're new try to stick to

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,080
plus or

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,279
minus zero votes and the question is

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,320
okay what what is

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,640
what the heck does that mean so let's um

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,679
quickly delve into apache software

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,080
foundation style voting

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:39,440
okay and

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:43,279
there's a good write-up on this

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,720
in the community section of the

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,640
the apache.org main site but this kind

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,440
of gives you just a quick

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,440
little uh you know scratch the surface

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,720
into voting and i'll try to you know be

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,120
kind of clear on some of this stuff

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,200
because

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,039
there's some nuances here that um even i

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,120
didn't know until yesterday

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,400
but uh standardly when you're when

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,440
you're talking about

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,279
consensus like talking about an idea

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,720
or setting up for a proposal

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,200
or doing a release of artifacts

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,880
we use a voting mechanism and you've

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,760
probably seen some of that around if

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,640
you're familiar

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,760
and have been on these dev email lists

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,200
um but

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,960
we have plus one is yes we have plus

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,559
zero i'm okay with this and

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,400
uh i don't care um

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
sometimes people will plus zero and be

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,760
like i don't really want to get involved

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,360
with that i think that it's a bad idea

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,159
but i'm not gonna block

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,279
and i'm not gonna really spend a whole

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,000
lot of time

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,640
telling you why i think it's a bad idea

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,039
um people throw out minus zeros

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,240
uh i particularly like the minus zero

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,799
because i try to

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,720
spend my time in minus zero as opposed

00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,080
to minus one

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,440
and that's where i expressly am

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,520
non-blocking of a proposal or an idea

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
but i'm trying to offer a dissenting

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,480
opinion so i'll

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,679
if i have a minus zero explain

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,320
why i think it's a bad idea but this is

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
the case

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,440
like i was talking about earlier where i

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,120
i'll go out

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:25,039
and and go and help the person

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,520
with their issues even if they go away

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,640
from

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,840
the opinion that i've offered and so i i

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,840
particularly enjoy

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,840
minus zero so that i can uh

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,600
try to move things in a direction that i

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,440
that i think are a good direction

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,520
architecturally and whatnot

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
and still keep the community together

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,480
because a minus

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,799
one is a direct veto and that applies

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,799
on

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,400
consensus building so if i'm trying to

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,120
talk about a topic generally

00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:03,039
um that applies on official proposals

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:06,240
and um on lazy votes

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,400
it's not entirely clear to me whether a

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,279
minus zero kills the vote i think that

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,360
it probably

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,120
does unless we're talking about

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,720
releasing components so let's actually

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,520
look let's go through those things those

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,520
are on the next page

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,360
so voting is used in a variety of

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,640
capacities okay

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,320
uh consensus building which is

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
non-formal so you know like somebody's

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,559
like

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,919
i'm thinking about uh adding these

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,360
commits and someone's like oh yeah plus

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,520
one that sounds like a great idea

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,640
that's kind of the consensus non-formal

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,799
zone uh proposals

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,440
that's where you actually lob a vote out

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,399
there and it's not about

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,880
explicitly released binaries it's more

00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,520
about

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,720
project direction and a minus one in

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,080
this capacity is indeed a veto

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,480
and just pulls the whole thing off the

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,600
table um they're lazy

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,640
votes and package releases uh

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,880
we actually on uh commons have

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,240
some lazy vote package releases but

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,039
they're only

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,279
on artifacts that are to be consumed

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,080
internally to the project so for example

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,720
the commons parent palm is a lazy vote

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,760
and

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,120
that way the community doesn't have to

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,120
spend their time

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,559
trying to sort out whether or not

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,080
commons parents a

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,120
a solid release because

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,000
the only people that are going to

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,080
consume it are the commons projects

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,679
and the only way to really find out

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,640
whether or not a potential parent

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,799
candidate

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,000
is going to work is to integrate it into

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,840
the project so

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,440
we do a lazy vote we send it out there

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,039
and if there bugs with it we just up

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,080
version and continue forward

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:44,960
and then package releases

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,159
has a little bit more rigor behind it so

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,520
with package releases

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:53,120
you need to have three pnc votes

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,960
that are plus ones and then

00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,000
a majority and

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,120
by a majority i mean you know

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,720
if you have three plus ones and three

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,799
minus ones that's stalemate

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,559
if you've got three plus ones and four

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,679
minus ones that means you're not going

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,440
out the door

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,679
and if you've got three plus ones and

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,399
two minus ones then you're good to go

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,440
that said let's go to the next page and

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,120
talk about how we on

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,039
on commons do do this um

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,039
so this is all very very community

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,720
dependent about how

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,399
the the i mean they're rigid guidelines

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,720
out there but you can get more subtle

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,640
than

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,320
than those rigid guidelines the rules

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,039
are kind of like a good scaffold

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,200
but for example we on commons oh wait

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,600
this is

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,840
i missed a page did i skip over a page

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,799
oh here we go that's what i was trying

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,480
to say

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,760
this last bit uh if i roll a release

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,360
candidate on commons on comments

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,120
language somebody gives me a minus one

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,799
i'm gonna take it really seriously and

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,559
i'm probably gonna cancel the release

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,240
and i'm probably gonna go back through

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,799
and figure out why they gave me a minus

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,159
one

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:07,520
a lot of times it's because like

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,000
the notice file doesn't have the latest

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,760
copyright

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,360
or something like that and that's a

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,919
minor knit right but

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,960
having the latest copyright on our stuff

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,760
when we go out the door is quite

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,799
important

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,000
so we take the

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:25,200
the minus votes very very seriously and

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,480
try to indulge whatever the minus one

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,120
was for

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,600
um so regarding the the privileges

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,440
and this is kind of a trust hierarchy

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,640
and i've actually used this

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,960
in a variety of locations um

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,080
i've tried to use this at uh most of my

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,399
workplaces as

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,000
mechanisms of you know these are the

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,720
levels of trust whether you like it or

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,919
not

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,279
and um this is community dependent but

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,320
apache generally has the

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,120
the following hierarchy um there's a

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,279
user

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,640
so that's anyone consuming the software

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,080
uh there's a contributor so that's

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
anyone who has

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,600
commits in the repository or

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,600
documentation

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,080
that they've written that is actively

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,840
being served in any capacity

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,360
um and so

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,760
yeah that's that's pretty clear what

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,399
that is um a committer is someone who

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,039
can

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,679
actually push commits to the repository

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,679
directly

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,519
uh for apache commons we

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,559
accommodate that they can make changes

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,360
to any site

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,399
that make the site or components and

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,000
they can

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:38,080
present votes for voting

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,919
for releases you kind of need to have

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,360
commit privileges to get all the release

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,320
notes and all that stuff

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,600
set up in a branch um it wouldn't

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,919
surprise me

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,840
now with the mechanics of get that that

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,360
somebody could potentially

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,679
do a release without

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,600
having direct commit rights to the

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,960
repository but um it would be really

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,399
tricky and they would need someone to

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:06,480
hold their hand pretty closely

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,480
and uh for a project

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,840
there's the committee member so they

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,279
they have the ability to vote on

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,679
releases

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,679
they can propose new committers they can

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,279
propose new committee members

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:22,799
um and then there's the committee chair

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,360
um they prepare

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,480
reports for the board about the

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,320
project's

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,960
direction and success um i say ugg here

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,799
now i've i've become someone that has to

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,960
give monthly reports to the board

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,960
as the uh jakarta ee guy so um

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,399
i suppose i need to remove ugg from the

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,360
uh

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,120
from the slides but what you gonna do it

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,320
was there from when i i presented this

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,480
back in 2019

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,559
so after i got commit rights this is

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,600
kind of wrapping up

00:32:52,559 --> 00:33:00,240
what i did in commons to get to uh

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,000
to get into the pmc so i got commit

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,080
rights in the fall of 16 and i was

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,120
invited into the pmc

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,600
in june of 17 and so i emailed gary

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,360
and benedict those guys that you saw

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,240
back there on the commons lang

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
committers uh screen and i said okay

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,440
what do you guys

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120
think that we should do and they had a

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,840
couple suggestions and one of them was

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,799
that this

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,799
component commons text was in the

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,919
sandbox and they thought that uh

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:34,320
it might be a good idea to move

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,519
some of the textier stuff like edit

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,720
distances

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,799
and heavy text manipulation algorithms

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,760
out of commons lang and into

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,080
a separate library so that commons lang

00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,279
is

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,559
more of a library for the arbitrary java

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,200
developer

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,480
so that you know if you're doing java

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,039
applications develop

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,399
application development that if you

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,200
don't have commons laying

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,320
in in your your dependency list then you

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,519
know it's kind of a bit of a head

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,399
scratcher because you're probably

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,559
writing a lot of

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,000
functionality that would otherwise be

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,200
present and written for you and

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,440
maintained for you already

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,639
so i asked benedict and gary what they

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,960
thought i should do

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,320
and they told me that i should start

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,639
working on commons text

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,159
so i read up on figuring out how to

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,159
release components because we've got a

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,919
page specifically dedicated to the

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,159
documentation of preparing a release out

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:30,079
of commons and how that works

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,320
and then i moved a bunch of stuff out of

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,599
laying into text the stuff's still in

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,520
lang because we haven't done a major

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,040
release and we make non-breaking changes

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,560
but it's deprecated and i did a beta

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,320
release and two dot releases

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:48,800
and then later on that year i helped

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:51,599
get commons file upload out the door

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,079
that had a cve associated with it and i

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,720
was kind of new to cdes at the time

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,720
and uh

00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,599
so i kind of had my hands in on the the

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,400
file upload release

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,760
and incidentally i didn't know this at

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,680
the time but that was

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,440
in and around the same same sort of zone

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:17,200
that the um equifax data breach

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,599
happened in um the actual data breach

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,680
was

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,320
in struts and in a specific section of

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,480
struts

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,560
that mirrors what was going on in

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,720
commons file upload

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,160
and um the reason that the data breach

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,079
even happened was that

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,760
uh equifax wasn't using the latest

00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,200
version of struts

00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,599
by the way you should use the latest

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,599
version of the of the the

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,760
libraries that you you're consuming or

00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,160
at least attempt to do so it's it's

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,680
good security practice but um i got that

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,520
out the door and then

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,599
uh myself and this other guy pascal

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,640
schumer schumacher got voted into being

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,440
on the pmc

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,560
and since then i've fixed a bunch of

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,680
different cves

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,640
i've released a bunch of different

00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,320
components and then um

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,800
this is where questions would arise and

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,200
so the question would then become

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,000
how did i make it to being a an apache

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,359
member

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,119
and in the winter

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:17,119
of 2018 i subscribe to the

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:21,599
community dev list

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:24,640
and um the

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,000
road show for dc the apache road show is

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,079
a one day event

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,680
was being planned and so i offered to

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,240
help with that and

00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,720
i set up the website or at least i got

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,119
all the

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,359
the data entry done for the website and

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,920
then we had the event and it went pretty

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,000
well

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,160
uh it was well attended and um

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,440
just following that i got voted into

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,240
being a member

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,359
and i i've been eternally grateful i've

00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,400
been trying to

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,760
steward things as best i could

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,359
uh or as best i can uh across

00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:03,839
apache i try to be uh open-minded

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:06,560
and and listening to the community

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,960
uh you might actually see a quote from

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,960
me

00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,160
and uh there was a an article out in

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,960
the stack overflow blogs about open

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
source stuff

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,079
and my quote was something to the effect

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,320
of

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,960
well you know we own apache do things in

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,480
a real democratic way not slow

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,079
but you know the benevolent dictator

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
model that's worked for some people i

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,680
mean look at

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,320
look at linus and the linux kernel right

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,480
and so

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,760
being open-minded about how people do

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,200
things differently

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,640
is really really important um and so i

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,079
try to keep that

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,200
keep that in mind and so uh that's

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,920
that's my whole whole spiel and i've got

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,839
two minutes and 15 seconds left

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,520
and um i'll hop over and see if there

00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,160
any questions so if i could so i can

00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,520
answer

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,160
answer questions let's see here uh

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,960
how do you choose the right project to

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,680
work

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,839
for the next for the next years to come

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,880
uh

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,880
that's that's um

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,320
that's hard uh

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,880
i know apache commons kind of is an

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,839
old-fashioned sort of project right we

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,280
uh

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,440
we

00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,960
it just it just is what it is right we

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,560
try to stay with the

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,880
latest long-term supported version of

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,160
java and try to keep the ball moving

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,440
forward but it's kind of an

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,520
old project the new work there in the

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,200
commons world is actually in the random

00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,119
number generator area and some of the

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,320
math projects which is kind of cool to

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,720
see

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,160
but um it's really hard to know where

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,160
the right place is to be

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,400
i you know sometimes wish i was on the

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,760
kubernetes project or on the go project

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,119
personally but

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,599
you know i i find that uh

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,960
sticking with the project that i'm on i

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,079
i find that to be an important

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,119
characteristic of

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,040
of keeping things moving

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,000
i've i've made contributions here and

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,200
there to other things i've made

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,359
contributions to jack

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,560
jack's rs i've made contributions to

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,000
the spring framework uh i'm making

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,400
contributions right now

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,920
to the intersource commons about uh open

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,359
source governance

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,240
and trying to define what an intersource

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,760
project is um i'm trying to you know

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,599
lift a whole lot of the open source

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,079
definition

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,520
in that um and the reason that i'm doing

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,200
that is uh

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,800
part of the time that i was at uh

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,240
capital one i

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,240
tried to start an inner source

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,680
incubator a whole lot like the apache

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,040
incubator and it kind of

00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,079
went up and then petered and then

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,839
didn't get enough uh it didn't get

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,920
enough

00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,280
executive support to really take off but

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,480
i mean c'est la vie

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,520
um is accepting a pmc nomination worth

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,599
it

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,599
uh that's a great question um

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,920
there is responsibility that goes along

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,119
with it

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,839
but there's also uh prestige that goes

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,079
along with it so

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:15,359
it shows that you

00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,839
have some power in the open source world

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,920
i mean

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,960
what little power i have i mean i don't

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,160
know

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,359
i get to vote on releases but um i i've

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,079
found it to be worth it it's

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,079
it's still a lot of time but um

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,880
i don't know it i've i've also found

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,880
myself

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,880
sometimes not spending as much time as i

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,040
would like on the project

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,119
and that's i spent a lot of time last

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,400
year at a financial startup

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,920
and um i needed to focus on their

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,920
aws security and so i spent the whole

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,440
time doing that and doing aws

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,839
networking and i am as opposed to

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,319
working on commons and then

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,839
i was afforded some free time in the

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:01,200
spring and so i did a little bit more

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,040
commons work

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,000
and um i've been trying to

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,560
make sure that release candidates that

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,240
get

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,079
votes proposed on them actually get

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,599
voted on so

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:16,079
i'm still trying to make sure that i'm

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,640
reasonably engaged despite the fact that

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
i may not be actively making commits but

00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,560
right now i know that i need to

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,920
release commons parent and commons uh

00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,680
release plug-in which are the two

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,240
mechanisms by which

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,000
we've automated and streamlined our

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,200
release process i actually wrote the

00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,240
release plug-in based on the uh

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,599
the maven release plug-in and the only

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,160
reason that we have our own release

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,280
plug-in

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,560
is that our release mechanics involves

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,480
checking things into a subversion

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,000
repository publishing a site

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,520
and doing a bunch of really custom

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
things and so

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
i found it prudent to have all those

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,440
things scripted and why not just do that

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,319
in the maven plug-in so that's why i

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,640
wrote that

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,839
um if people are trying to do releases

00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,359
themselves i would suggest

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,880
using the maven release plug-in and not

00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,319
the commons release plug-in because our

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,599
release plug-in won't get you anywhere

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,119
good

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,760
um other than if you're trying to

00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,520
release one of our artifacts

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,160
and check a bunch of stuff into the

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,839
commons um

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,400
release artifact staging area and

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,119
subversion

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,119
um any other questions uh if you guys

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,079
have any more questions i've actually

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,520
created a commons

00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,880
