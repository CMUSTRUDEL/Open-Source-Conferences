Description: 
	From no open source experience to Apache Member and PMC of Commons
Rob Tompkins

A presentation from ApacheCon @Home 2020

Between 2016 and 2019 I went from having not made any Apache contributions to being on the PMC of Apache Commons. I will tell my story here and give insights about how the Apache Way works. This talk has been previously given at the DC Apache Roadshow with a positive response.

I am a software developer and mathematician from Richmond, Virginia who happens to be an Apache Member and am on the PMC of Apache Commons. I also particularly enjoy outdoor adventure sports for those interested.
